Selections from the Travels of 
Ibn Battuta


INTRODUCTION

§ I, IDN DATTUTA AND HIS WORK

To the world of today the men of medieval ChriAcn-
dom already seem remote and unfamiliar. Their
names and deeds are recorded in our hiftory-books,
their monuments ^ill adorn our cities, but our kin-
ship with them is a thing unreal, which coils an effort
of the imagination. How much more muil this
apply to the great Islamic civilization, that ilood over
againil medieval Europe, menacing its exiilcncc and
yet linked to it by a hundred tics that even war and fear
could not sever. Its monuments too abide, for those
who may have the fortune to visit them, but its men
and manners are to mofi of us utterly unknown, or
dimly conceived in the romantic image of the Arabian
Nights, Even for the spcdalifl it is difficult to re-
conflruft their lives and sec them as they %verc.
Hiflorics and biographies there arc in quantity, but
the hiflorians, for all their pi^resque details, seldom
show the ability to sclcft the essential and to give
their figures that touch of the intimate which makes
them live again for the reader. It is in this faculty
that Ibn Battdta excels. Of the multitudes that crowd
upon the 51age in the pageant of medieval Islam there
is no figure more inflinft with life than his. In his
book he not only lays before us a faithful portrait of
himself, with all his virtues and his failings, but evokes

a whole age as it were from the dead. These travels
have been ransacked by historians and geographers,
but no estimate of his work is even faintly satisfactory
which does not bear in mind that it is firSt and fore-
moSt a human diary, in which the tale of faCts is sub-
ordinated to the interests and preoccupations of the
diarist and his audience. It is impossible not to feel
a liking for the character it reveals to us, generous
to excess, humane in an age when life was its . at
cheapest, bold (did ever medieval traveller fear the
sea less ?), fond of pleasure and uxorious to a degree,
but controlled withal by a deep vein of piety and
devotion, a man with all the makings of a sinner, and
something of a saint.

Of the external events of Ibn Battdta’s life we know
little beyond what he himself tells us. The editor
of the travels, Ibn Juzayy, notes that he was born
at Tangier on 24th February, 1304, and from a brief
reference in a later book of biographies we know
that after his return to Morocco he was appointed
qadi or judge in one of the Moroccan towns, and died
there in 1368 or 1369. His own name was Muham-
mad son of Abdallah, Ibn Battiita being the family
name, Slill to be found in Morocco. His family had
apparently been settled in Tangier for some genera-
tions and belonged to the Berber tribe of the Luwata,
which fir^t appears in hiCfory as a nomadic tribe in
Cyrenaica and on the borders of Egypt. For the re^l
he divulges incidentally in a passage relating to his
appointment as qadi iri Delhi, that he came of a house
which had produced a succession of qadis, and later
on he mentions a cousin who was qadi of Rondah
in Spain. He belonged, in consequence, to the re-
ligious upper-class, if the term may be used, of the
Muhammadan community, and mu^ have received
the usual literary and scholastic education of the
theologians. On one occasion he quotes a poem of



TRAVELS OF IBK BATTOTA

his own composition, but the other verses quoted here
and there ouviously bear a more popular charafler
than the elaborate produ£Bons of tnc bcR Arabic
poetic schools. His professional intercA in men and
matters rclipious may be seen on nearly c\'cr}* page of
his work. It isc\‘idcnt fromthcllilof qSdls and other
theologians whom he saw in cver^* town on his travels
(sometimes to the exclusion of all other details), but
above all from his eagerness to visit famous shaykhs and
saints wherever he went, and the enthusiasm with
which he relates inBanccs of their miraculous gifts.

But to rate him, as some European scholars have
done, for his “ripmarolcs about Muhammadan saints
and spiritualises and for his “ Aupidit)* ” in paying
more attention to theologians than to details of the
places he visited, is singularly out of place. Such
religious details were matters in which he and his
audience were mod closely intcrciecd, and arc by no
means dc>’oid of intcrcA and vi]uc c\’cn to us. Out
of them, moreover, spring some of the mofl lively
passages of his narrative, such as his escape at Koel
(the modern Aligarh), and his account of the Sharif
Abii Ghurra. But it is of far greater importance to
remember that it was because he was a theologian
and because of his intcrcA in theologians that he
undertook his travels at all and survived to complete
them. When as a young man of twenty-one he set
out from his native town with a light heart, and not
much heavier purse, it was with no other aim than
that of making the pilgrimage to Mecca and the holy
places of his faith. The duty' laid upon every Muslim
of visiting Mecca at IcaA once in his lifetime, so long
as it lies within his power to do so, has been in all
ages a Aimulus to travel, far greater in degree than
the Aimulus of ChriAian pilgrimage in the Middle
Ages. At the same time, it created the organization
necessary to enable Muslims of every class Trom every
3



SELECTIONS FROM THE

country to carry out this obligation. The pilgrim on
his journey travelled in a caravan whose numbers
swelled at every ^age. He found all arrangements
made for his marches and his haltSj and if the road
lay through dangerous country, his caravan was pro,-
tefted by an escort of soldiers. In all large centres
as well as many intermediate Nations were re^l houses
and hospices where he was hospitably welcomed and
entertained out of endowments created by generations
of benefaftors. When such was the lot of every
pilgrim, the theologian received ^lill greater considera-
tion. His brethren in every town received him as
one of themselves, furnished his wants, and recom-
mended him to those at the next Nation. Under
these circumstances the brotherhood of Islam, which
knows no difference of race or birth, showed at its
be^t, and provided an incentive to travel unknown in
any other age or community.

Nor was the Pilgrimage the only inSlitution which
smoothed the traveller’s path. Throughout the Middle
Ages the trade routes of Africa and Asia and the
sea-borne trade of the Indian Ocean were almo^
exclusively in the hands of the Muslim merchants.
The travels of Ibn Battdta are but one of many sources
which reveal how widespread were their aftivities.
Though their caravans were exposed to greater dangers
in times of lawlessness and disorganization than were
the pilgrim caravans, they offered at lea^ a measure
of security to the casual traveller. It is evident from
our narratives that in the great majority of cases they
were animated by the same spirit of kindliness and
generosity that has always marked the mutual relations
of Muslims, and readily shared their resources with
their fellow-travellers in case of need. Later on
Ibn Battuta had more than once occasion to appre-
ciate their services, but at the outset he had no thought
of what the future held for him.

TR-AVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

On his arrival in Egypt, with his mind 5lill wholly
set on Mecca, he received the fir^l premonitions of
his future from two of the illuminati^ or saints who had
attained a high rank in the hierarchy of the Muslim
orders. From this point we see his vague desires
gradually crystallize into a definite ambition, though
he Still hesitates from time to time, especially when
his contacts with persons of saintly life awaken all his
inStinfts of devotion. Foiled in his firSt intention
of taking the diredt route to Mecca through Upper
Egypt (the usual route of the pilgrim caravans from
the WeSt), he determined to join inStead the pilgrim
caravan from Damascus, and on his way thither taSted
for the firSl time the joys of travel for its own sake.
As time was not pressing, he wandered at leisure
through the whole of Syria as far as the borders of
Asia Minor, before returning to Damascus to join the
caravan as it set out for the Holy Cities.

Hardly was this firA Pilgrimage over than he set
out a^ain to visit ‘Irdq, but turned back sharply before
reaching Baghddd, and made a long detour through
Khuzi^tdn. By now, he tells us, he had taken the
resolve never to cover the same ground twice, as far
as possible. His mind was dlill set on the Pilgrimage,
however, and he planned his journey to cover the
interval before returning to Mecca at the end of the
year. This time he renounced further travelling for
a space of three years and gave himself up to ^udy
and devotion at Mecca. For the theologian the Pil-
grimage meant not only the performance of one of
the principal obligations of the Faith, but an oppor-
tunity of putting himself in touch with the adlivitier
of the religious centre of Islam. Mecca was the ideal
centre of religious dludy, in the company of many of
the mo5l eminent doftors of the day. All this, no
doubt, was in Ibn Battdta’s mind. But we may, I
think, discern a further purpose. He had already

tions which he afterwards wove into one of the moft
remarkable descriptions we possess of any medieval
Muslim court. Little did Sultan or courtiers think
that six centuries afterwards their reputations would
depend on the notes and reminiscences of the obscure
and spendthrift qSdi from the We^t. At laft the
inevitable rupture occurred, whose consequences were
usually swift and fatal to the viftim of the royal dis-
pleasure. Ibn Battdta took refuge in his laft resort,
the adoption of the ascetic life, resigning all his offices
and giving away all his possessions. It was a genuine
aft of world-rcnuncaition, such as always lay near to
the heart of the medieval theologian, and seems to have
convinced Sultan Muhammad of the traveller's real
integrity and devotion. At all events, when he re-
quired shortly afterwards a truftworthy person to send
as his envoy to China, it was Ibn Battiita whom he
summoned. Ibn Battiita, for his part, it would seem,
was reluftant to doff his hermit’s garments and
“ become entangled in the world again.” But the
bribe was too great, and in 1342 he set off in semi-
regal ftate at the head of the mission to the moft
powerful ruler in the world of his time, the Mongol
Emperor of China.

Scarcely had he left the walls of Delhi when his
adventures began. For eight days he was a hunted
fugitive, and though he escaped to rejoin his embassy
3 J 7 its progress throvgh Ind/a, it was only to be left
with nothing but the clothes he ftood up in and his
prayer-mat on the shore at Calicut. To go on with
his mission in the circumftances was impossible;
to return to Dehli was to incur the wrath of Sultan
Muhammad. He chose inftcad to indulge his love
of adventure with the independent rulers of the Malabar
coaft, and eventually found himself at the Maidive
Islands, once again a qddf and a personage of im-
portance. Here too after eighteen months of lotos-
7



SELECTIONS FROM THE

eating his reforming zeal made of him an objeft of
suspicion and dislike, and he found it expedient to
leave the islands. The devotee in him again asserted
itself, and his fir^l objeft was to make a pilgrimage to
the “ Foot of Adam ” on the highe^ peak of Ceylon.
This done he returned to the Coromandel and Malabar
coafts, paid another brief visit to the Maidive Islands
and prepared in earnest for his journey to China.
Some months had ^lill to elapse before the sailing
season, however, and he chose to spend them in a
voyage to Bengal, for no other reason, apparently,
than to visit a famous shaykh living in Assam. He
then intercepted the “ Chinese ” vessels — really vessels
owned by Muhammadan merchants, with Chinese and
Malay crews — at Sumatra and went by a route that
has taxed the ingenuity of his commentators to the
“ Shanghai ” of China in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, the port of Ts’wan-chow-fu, or Zaytdn, as
it was known to the foreign merchants. For this
journey Ibn Battdta reassumed his role of ambassador,
though it may strike us as curious that no one seemed
to entertain any suspicions of an ambassador who
travelled without embassy or credentials. It was,
however, his only device for making his way through
China, though his theological reputation ^ood him in
good ^ead amongst his fellow-Muslims in the trading
ports. In every city on his progress to and from
Peking he was received with full honours, but at
Peking itself he was disappointed of seeing the Em-
peror, owing to his absence from the capital.

Returning to Zaytdn, he took ship again for Sumatra,
and thence for Malabar, but decided not to expose
himself a second time to the treacherous splendours
of Delhi, and made we^wards in^ead. He was in
Syria at the outbreak of the fir^ “ Black Death ” in
1348, and in a few terse sentences reveals its frightful
ravages. At this time he seems to have had no defi-

8

nite plans for the future, and was aiming only at com-
pleting yet another Pilgrimage, his seventh, to Mecca.
What eventually led him to return to his native land
is not clear. His own narrative places more weight
on the rapid access of Arength and prosperity which
Morocco enjoyed under Sultan Abal-Hasan and his
son Abu ‘Indn, than on those ties of family and
kindred which appear to us so much more natural
a reason. Possibly allowances should be made for
the part of exaggeration and flattery', but the brevity
of his dlay in Tangier, and the unemotional, almoft
brusque, manner in which he mentions it, scarcely
witness to an overmadlering homesickness, which, in
any case, was hardly to be expefted in a society so
cosmopolitan as that of medieval Islam.

The journey from Alexandria to the Barbary coa^l
was not without its alarms. Twice Ibn Battista
narrowly escaped capture by Chriftian corsairs, and
in addition his party was threatened by a robber band
almo^ within sight of Fez. Even yet his ambition
was not appeased. There were dlill two Muslim
countries which he had not visited — ^Andalusia and the
Negrolands on the Niger. Once again he took up
the dlaff of travel, not to lay it down again until some
three years later he could claim with justice the title
of “ The Traveller of Islam.” He was in fafl the only
medieval traveller who is known to have visited the
lands of every Muhammadan ruler of his time, quite
apart from such infidel countries as Con^lantinople,
Ceylon, and China, which were embraced in his
journeys. The mere extent of his wanderings is
estimated by Yule at not less than 75,000 miles,
without allowing for deviations, a figure which is not
likely to have been surpassed before the age of ^eam.

Unfortunately no account of Ibn Battiita has come
down to us (so far as is known) from anyone who saw
him on his journeys. There appear to be only two
9



SELECTIONS FROM THE

known references to him in the writings of contempo-
raries, and both are concerned chiefly with the credi-
bility of his Tories, which was hotly disputed. What
they thought of him personally we are not told, but
are able to infer occasionally from his own candid
^atements. Twice we find him, after receiving
a cordial welcome, becoming an obje6l of dislike or
suspicion, at Delhi and again in the Maidive Islands.
In the fir^ case the cause was his extravagance, in the
second it was fear of his growing influence and resent-
ment at his haughty independence. There can be
no que^ion that he expefted of princes and minivers
a lavish exercise of the virtue of generosity, which was
indeed in his eyes — as in those of his age and com-
munity generally — their principal claim to respeff.
It may be taken as a general rule that when Ibn Battdta
says of this or the other prince that he is “ a good
sultan ” or “ one of the be^l of rulers,” he means only
that he is scrupulous in the performance of his religious
duties and openhanded in his dealings, especially with
theologians. We can well underhand that this
attitude was apt to pall on his patrons and lead at
length to unpleasant incidents, or at least mutual
dislike. Apart from these rare cases, however, he

appears to have been liked and respefted wherever he
went.

In attempting to e^imate the value of Ibn BattiJta’s
work, some description mu^ be given of the book
Itself. Ibn Batata may have taken notes of the
places that he visited, but the evidence is rather again^
It. Only once^ does he refer to notes, when he says
that at Bukhara he copied a number of epitaphs from
t e tornbs of famous scholars, but afterwards lo^
them when the Indian pirates Gripped him of all that
^ ^ f epitaphs were of special interest to

j theologians because they con-

fine lifts of the writings of the deceased. Ibn

Battista was not himself a man of letters who was likely
to regard his experiences as material for a book; on
the contrar}', he seems to haw entertained no idea of
writing them down.

On his return to Fez he had related his adventures
to the sultan and the court, where they were received
with general incredulity, as we know from a passage
in the works of his great contemporar)', the hi^lorian
Ibn Khaldiin. . He found, however, a powerful sup-
porter in the wazfr, at whose inRigation possibly
the sultan gave inAruftions to one of the principal
secretaries, Muhammad ibn Juzap', to commit them
to writing. Ibn Juza)ty accordingly compiled the
work which we possess at the diflation of Ibn Battuta.
The result is a book of somewhat composite chamber.
The writer was not always content to take down Ibn
Battista's narratives as they were delivered. He shows
commendable care in regiBcring the cxail pronuncia-
tion of every foreign name (a matter of some importance
in view of the nature of the Arabic script), but in some
other respc£ls his editing is open to criticism. By
his own ilatemcnt the work is an abridgment, which

f iossibly accounts for the brevity of one or two of the
atcr seflions. The bulk of the narrative has been
left with but little touching-up in the simple, straight-
forward ftylc of the narrator, out at points Ibn Juzayy
has embellished it in the taSle of the age, with passages
of rhetorical prose and cxfni^s from poems, whtch
seldom add much of interest. His interpolation of
incidents from his own experience may be excused,
but another of his proceedings is more questionable.
He had before him the narrative of the travels of
Ibn Jubayr, an Andalusian scholar who visited Egypt,
the Hij5z, and Syria in the twelfth centuty, and wrote
an account of his experiences which enjoyed a great
reputation in the Weft. Where Ibn Battiita covers
the same ground, Ibn Juzayy has often subftituted
XI



SELECTIONS FROM THE

rpossibly at Ibn Battiita’s desire or with his per-
mission) an abridgment of Ibn Jubayr’s work, notably
in the account of the ceremonies observed at Mecca
during the Pilgrimage and at other seasons of the year.
We have consequently to bear in mind that the book
is not entirely Ibn Battuta’s work; there ^ are indeed
indications (for example, in the transcriptions and
translations of Persian phrases) that the reputed author
did not himself read the book at all, or if he did, read
it negligently.

Taking the work, then, as a whole, we niuft regard
it as primarily intended to present a descriptive account
of Muhammadan society in the second quarter of the
fourteenth century. Ibn Battiita’s intereft in places
was, as we have seen, subordinate to his interest in
persons. He is the supreme example of h geogra-phe
malgre lui^ whose geographical knowledge was gained
entirely from personal experience and the information
of chance acquaintances. For his details he relied
exclusively on his memory, a memory, it is true, which
had been highly cultivated by the ordinary sy^em of
theological education. Involving the memorizing of
large numbers of works, but ^lill liable to slips and
confusions, more or less great. In his itineraries he
sometimes misplaces the order of towns, and twice at
lea^ leaves himself in the air, as it were, with a gap
of hundreds of miles. He gives wrong names at
several points, especially when he is dealing with
non-Muslim countries, where his knowledge of Arabic
and Persian was of little service to him. In his hi^ori-
cal narratives, which are generally tru^worthy, similar
miftakes are jFound. It Is indeed remarkable that the
errors are comparatively few, considering the enormous
number of persons and places he mentions. The mo^
serious difficulty is offered by the chronology of the
travels, which is utterly impossible as it ^ands. Many
of the dates give the impression of having been Inserted

12



travels of IBN BATTUTA

more or less at haphazard, possibly at the editor^
requeft, but the examination and correttion ot them
offtrs a task so great that it has not been attempted in

this seleftion. .

There is finally the queSion of his veracity. Thfe
can be no doubt that in his narratives of the Muslim
countries, notwithftanding errors of exaggeration ^d
misunderftanding, Ibn Batthta faithfully relates what
he believes to be true. Some critics have, however,
regarded his claim to have visited Conftantinople and
China with considerable dubiety. The principal diffi-
culties as regards the visit to Constantinople are the
vagueness of his route and his claim to have met the
ex-Emperor, when by his own chronology the ex-
Emperor had been dead for over a year. The firft
can be explained by the difficulties of an Arabic-
speaking traveller in such unfamiliar surroundings,
the second by an error in dating. The account of the
city itself is so full and accurate that it cannot be other
than the narrative of an eye-witness, who enjoyed
exceptional facilities such as Ibn Battdta had, and his
interview with the ex-Emperor in particular bears
the unmillakable ftamp of truth.

The difficulties contained in the narrative of the
journeys to and in China are generally of the same order,
and will be more fully considered in their place. It
need only be said here that to deny them raises even
greater difficulties, and that by exaftly the same kind
of reasoning it can be “proved” that though Ibn
Battuta undoubtedly was in India he never went
there 1 Ibn Battdta is always unsatisfaaory when he
relies on second-hand information, and it is moft
unlikely that he could have put together so personal
a narrative had the ftatements of others not been
supplemented by his own observations. There are
also some material arguments in favour of his claim to
have visited China. He had, in his capacity as envoy
>3



SELECTIONS FROM THE

from the Sultan of Delhi, very good reason for going
there, and facilities for travel in China which were
denied to the ordinary merchant. In the second place
one obscure passage in the narrative of his doings
at Khansa (Hang-chow) is cleared up by an earlier
passage relating to his visit to Shaykh Jaldl ad-Din in
Assam, with which the journey to China is closely
connefted. Thirdly, if his claim were false, he dlood
a reasonable chance of being exposed. He relates
with some emphasis that in his journey through
Northern China he met a merchant from Ceuta, the
brother of a man living in Sijilmasa, in Morocco, whom
he subsequently met also. That this merchant should
have had some communication with Morocco, even in
those days, is not impossible, since I bn Battiita himself
had once transmitted a sum of money from India to
Mequinez. On the whole, therefore, the narrative
dealing with China seems to me to be genuine, though
it is certainly related with greater brevity than usual,
either because Ibn Battiita could not recall the Chinese
names, if he learned them, with the same ease as the
more familiar Arabic and Persian names, or because it
was more dra^ically abridged by the editor. I can in
fa£t see no alternative, except to suppose that he was
hypnotized into the belief that he had gone there by
one of the miracle-working saints whom he met in
India.

Ibn Battiita was fir^ brought into prominence by
the translation of an abridged text by Dr. Samuel Lee
in 1829. The complete text of the Travels, which
was found in Algeria a few years later, was published
with a French translation and critical apparatus by
Defrdmery and Sanguinetti in the middle of the
century from a number of manuscripts, one of which,
containing the second half of the work, is the autograph
of the original editor, Ibn Juzayy. The French
translation, though on the whole remarkably accurate,

suRcrs from the absence of cxplanator)* notes. Various
se£lions of the book (chiefiy from the French text)
have been annotated by scholars familiar with the
countries themselves, but a large amount Aill remains
to be worked over. In the present sclc^lions, w’hich
have been translated afresh from the Arabic text,
Ibn Battdla is treated as a traveller, and not as a writer
of geography. SulTicicnt indications have, it is hoped,
been added in the text and the notes to enable the
course of his journeys to be followed in detail on any
large-scale atlas, but many problems of geography
have been passed over in silence. The easy collo-
quialism of his ^yle has been retained in translation
as far as possible, in preference to a ^lilted Elizabethan
language. It has not been easy to make a selcftion
from the wealth of narrative and anecdote contained
in the work, and many intcreiling sc£lions have neces-
sarily been omitted or abridged. But until the appear-
ance of a complete version (such as the writer is now
preparing for the Haklu)^ Socict)’) it is hoped that
this extraft may be of service in introducing to a wider
circle of English readers one of the moA remarkable
travellers of his own or any age.

§ 2. THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF IBN BATT&Ta’s
TRAVELS

, The Islamic world in the fourteenth century differed,
in extent and outward splendour, but little from the
magnificent empire ruled by the Caliphs of Damascus
and Baghdad in the eighth. If in the WcA it had
been shorn of its outpoAs in Spain and Sicily, it could
juAly claim to have more than balanced the loss by its
extension in India and Malaysia. It had recently
wiped out the laA traces of the humiliation infliAed
upon it by the crusading Franks, and was on the
point of cxaAing a signal vengeance by the sword of
*5



SELECTIONS FROM THE

the Ottomans in Europe. Yet it was true, notwith-
standing all these apparent signs of progress, that the
political fabric of Islam was Stricken with mortal
disease. The centuries had taken a heavy toll of
vitality from that huge frame, and had left it Still
formidable, it may be, but wounded at the heart.

The laSt Crusader had indeed been driven from the
shores of Syria, but at what a coSt! Two centuries
of Struggle and intrigue had been necessary to repel
attacks that the warriors of the early generations had
regarded as the minor incidents of outpoSt warfare.
The sceptre had passed from the hands of the supple
Arab and the cultured Persian to those of the violent
and illiberal Turk. For more than two centuries
after the year looo the ambitions of Turkish generals
and chieftains had torn and retorn the body of Islam,
devastating its lands by their misgovernment and
continual warfare more effectively than any foreign
foe. Convulsion succeeded to convulsion, until at
length the heathen Mongols from Central Asia made
hares of the Turkish lions, and in 1258 formed the
derelict eaStern lands of Islam into a province of their
immense empire.

This event, the shock of which seemed to the
Muslim peoples like the LaSt Judgment of the Wrath
of God, proved in the end a blessing in disguise. Once
again the eaStern provinces enjoyed a period of firm
and relatively undisturbed government, under which
commerce and agriculture took heart and began to
re-create a prosperity that seemed to have vanished
for ever . Simultaneously Egypt and Syria, which
had withstood the Mongol onset, enjoyed under a
succession of capable rulers a rare period of peace and
prosperity. The Turkish captains who had hitherto
quarrelled over the mangled fragments of the central
provinces, were relegated to the frontiers, where they
indulged their taSte for warfare at the expense of the

infidel and the heathen, winning for themselves a
goodly portion of the riches of this world, and the
reputation of “ Warriors for the Faith ** to ensure their
portion in the world to come. The Mongol conqucRs
thus efTcflually contributed to the successes gained by
the arms of Islam in India, and a few years later also
in Thrace and the Balkan Peninsula, successes which
were supplemented by the missionary labours of saints
and darwish orders.

\V}ien in 1325 Ibn Bathita set out on his journeys,
the political conditions in the Islamic lands were, in
consequence, relatively AabIc and unusually favourable
for travel. From AswAn to the frontier of Cilicia the
word of the Sultan of Eg)*pt was undisputed; the
Crusaders were but a bitter memor)*, and relations
with the Mongols, though not cordial, had not led
to warfare since the laA great vlflory of the youthful
Nisir at Damascus in 1303. *Ir.Aq and Persia ^lill
acknowledged the rule of the Mongol IFkhAns, now
good Muslims, but dcAincd soon to disappear. To
5 ie north and north-eaA the other Mongol khanates
of the Golden Horde and of Jaghatdy were on friendly
terms. Finally in India the ferocious but energetic
Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad ibn Tughlaq, was imposing
his ovcrlordship on the crcalcr part of the suo-con-
tinent. On the fringes 0? the great kingdoms, and in
such outlying parts as Anatolia, Afghanistan, and the
shores of the Indian Ocean, there cxiiled a hoSl of
petty sultans and amirs, who acknowledged no maSlcr
and maintained a precarious throne on the proceeds
of trade or freebooting, but these could hardly inflift
serious damage, even had the)' been so minded, on the
Islamic community in general. Commerce proceeded
freely both within and without the frontiers of Islam,
in spite of heavy dues and occasional vexations; and
if the indigenous industries had declined, in some
eases to the point of extinction, the revival of the

Sicilians less than twenty* years later, and only recovered
it in 1334 with Neapolitan and Genoese help. Their
empire extended in faft only over the coa^al ^Irip,
with some few fortified towns in the interior. The
prosperit}* of Tunis was due solely to its advantageous
position at the debouchment of the main trade routes
from the interior, which made it the premier commer-
cial city of the Maphrib and second only to Alexandria
among the Muslim Mediterranean ports, while its
culture, like that of the Maghrib generally, was mainly
suftained by refugees from the reconquered provinces
of Spain.

Tnc Marinid dynafty of Morocco, makers of a
richer territor)*, were in ilill worse ease. Their
hiflor)' is a monotonous record of blood and ftrife;
few rulers were able to withiland the revolts and
intrigues of their ambitious relatives, and these few
used what respite they gained in militar)' expeditions
againfl their neighbours, or, more worthily, again^l
the ChriAians in Spain. The dynaBy rc.ichcd its
zenith under Abu*l-Hasan (1331-4^) bis son
Abii ‘Inin (1348-58), whose names frequently recur
in the latter part of Ibn Battdta’s narrative. Abu’l-
Hasan succeeded in capturing SijilmAsa and Tlemscn,
and, in spite of a sanguinaiy’ defeat by the Spaniards
at Tarifa in 1340, was able to add Tunis to his domi-
nions in 1347, only to lose it immediately and simul-
taneously lose his throne to his rebel son Abii ‘Inin.
The latter in turn, having recaptured Tlemscn and
re-entered Tunis in 1357, was deserted by his army
and ilrangicd on his return to Fez, leaving the king-
dom a prey to indescribable anarchy. Nevertheless
Morocco itself enjoyed during these two reigns a period
of relative prosperity, and its great cities were beautified
by many public buildings, which in their day can have
been little inferior to the magnificent monuments of
Egypt and India. There is, in consequence, some

ju^ification for the exuberant praise which _Ibn
Battiita be^ows upon Abii Tnan’s beneficent adminis-
tration, especially if it is remembered how chaotic
were the conditions which, as will be seen, he had ju^l .
left behind in the Ea^.

It is a pity that Ibn Battfita did not put on record
the fir^ impressions left on his mind when, as a young
man fresh from the narrow provincial life of Tangier,
he traversed the highly cultivated Delta of Egypt and
set foot in its opulent and teeming capital, then the
metropolis of Islam. Alone of all the Islamic lands
outside Arabia, Egypt had preserved the heritage of
Muslim culture, while the Mongols in the Ea^l and
the nomadic Arabs and Berbers in the We^ carried
deva^ation up to its very gates. Though the dyna^y
founded by the great Saladin had given place to the
military oligarchy known as the Mamldks, or White
Slaves, a form of government than which in theory
none could be worse, Egypt from 1260 to 1341
enjoyed, with short intervals of turmoil, not only
widespread power and pre^ige, but also a high degree
of prosperity. This was due mainly to three things.
The Mamliik Sultans Baybars I (1260-77), Qala’iin
(1279-90), and al-Malik an-Nasir (i 299-1 341), what-
ever their personal faults (and they were many), were
exceedingly capable and far-sighted rulers. In the
second place the bureaucratic admini^ration which
Egypt had inherited from its Byzantine and Fatimid
governors was in all probability the mo^ efficient
in^rument of government which exited in the Middle
Ages. Thirdly Egypt enjoyed almo^ a monopoly
of the Indian trade, the mo^t profitable of all medieval
commerce, and drew from it the va^ revenues which
were needed for the upkeep of its elaborate organiza-
tion, as well as for the con^ruftion of the unsurpassed
series^ of architedlural monuments which are the
peculiar glory of Cairo. Under these circum^ances

20



TRAVELS OF iBN BATTOTA

the Maml<!ik sultans were able not only to maintain
their authority againfl the Mongols in Syria and the
Hijiz, but also to extend it into Nubia and Anatolia,
and even weflwards to TrinoH for a time.

The measure of Egypt's fortune may be gauged
from the flalc of the rival kingdom of 'Irdo and Persia.
Of its former imperial cities some, like iJalkh, were
now mere names dinging to mounds of rubbish, and
those which had escaped their fate were cither, like
Baghdad and Basra, withered and shrunken, or else
the prey of contending faflions, and though new
cities, such as Tabriz and Sultinl)*a, had risen into
prominence, their prosperity was evanescent. Already
trailed by the successive nomadic inwsions and civil
Aruggles of the two preceding centuries, the ruin of
'Irdq and Northern Persia seemed to have been con-
summated by the Mongol invasions between t2i8 and
1260. Under the firA heathen rulers of the Mongol
dynaAy, moreover, the Muslims were persecuted, but
with the ofHcial conversion to IsUm of Ghazin-Khin
in 1295 a brighter era seemed to dawn. Though
disorders continued to some extent under his succes-
sors Oljdytii (*305-16) and Abii Sa'id (1317-35),
Trdq, at Icafl, recovered some of its former prosperity.
The rich province of Fdrs, on the other hand, seems to
have been little affcflcd by the disaflers W’hich befell
the reft of Persia; though subjeft to the Mongols, it
remained, as it had always been, somewhat apart from
its neighbours, with its own peculiar culture and
traditions. To the norlh-eaft of Persia, across the
Oxus, were the territories of another Mongol dynafty,
the Jaghatdy-Khdns. During the early centuries of
Isldm Transoxania had been one of the moft flourishing
provinces of the Caliphate. Bukhdrd and Samarqand
had a reputation inferior to none of the great cities of
the Eaft, and even during the troublous times of
Turkish ovcrlordship in the eleventh and twelfth
21



SELECTIONS FROM THE

centuries something of their prosperity ^lill lingered.
But it was on Transoxania that the fir^ fury of the
Mongol onset fell in 1219 and 1220, and under the
Jaghatdy-Khins, the mo^ turbulent and barbarian of
all the great Mongol dyna^ies, the shattered cities
and wafted countryside had little hope of recovering
more than a shadow of their former prosperity

The Muslim ftates in India have a totally different
hiftory. Sind had, indeed, formed a province of the
Caliphate, but the beginnings of an Indian Muslim
empire go no farther back than the twelfth century.
It was a great misfortune for India that the lateness of
this conqueft delivered her into the hands of merciless
and turbulent Turkish generals, whose aim was solely
to eftablish themselves as independent princes and to
extort as much as possible from its almoft inexhauftible
resources for their interminable wars. The sultans of
Delhi, the line of which begins with Qutb ad-Di'n
Aybak (1206-11), claimed a suzerainty over the other
ftates, which they were able to enforce only sporadically
and at appalling coft in blood and treasure. Unre-
ftrained by the cultural traditions and bureaucratic
organization of the old Isldmic lands, which their
fellow-countrymen, the Saljijqs and the Mamldks, had
been compelled to respeft, they gave free rein to their
impulses. In consequence “ the bloodftained annals
of the Sultanate of Delhi,” as Vincent Smith, the
hiftorian of India, remarks, “ are not pleasant reading.”
Of all the successors of Qutb ad-Din down to the
eftablishment of the Timdrid dynafty (the “ Grand
Moguls ”) in i 52’6, there is scarcely one who was not
intolerant, tyrannical, and cruel, and the same may be
said, with few exceptions, of the minor dynafties.
Aniong the early sultans the moft notable were Altamsh
or ntutmish (1211-36), who completed Qutb ad-Dm’s
buddings at Delhi, and ‘Ala ad-Din of the Khilji
dynafty (1296-131^), who repelled a series of Mongol

22



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

invasions and added many monuments to the archi-
teflurc of Delhi in addition to building the new town
ofSiri.

In 1321 the throne was occupied by Ghi)-ith ad-Dln
Tughlaq, under whom some sort of order was rcSlored
and the authority of Delhi extended again into Bengal
and the Deccan. His son Jtinl, the Sultan Muhammad
of Ibn Battiita’s time, had his father murdered in 132^,
and ascending the throne without opposition “occu-
pied it for twenty-six years of human tyTanny as
atrocious as any on record in the sad annals of human
devilry and then died in his bed." Yet the ambition
of the sultans of Delhi to create a vafl Indian empire
tvas more nearly achieved by him than by any other
sultan prior to the Moguls. His success might have
been Rill greater had it not been for the Rrangc contra-
diflions in his charafler so impartially exposed by
Ibn Battiita (see Chapter VI.) and confirmed by all
other available evidence. It would take us too far
afield to discuss here in detail the aflivities of this
exfraordinarj- ruler, and the reader may be referred to
the penetrating analysis contained in Vincent Smith's
Oxford Hinoryof India, pages 236 to 246.

Such were the conditions svhich Ibn Battdta found
on his caftward journey. When we follow him as he
retraced his Reps, less than twenty years later, it is
impossible not to Rand amazed at the anarchy which
within so short a period had spread over all the central
lands of Isldm. In India itself, Sultan Muhammad’s
grandiose designs had proved impossible to realize.
Without an organized adminiRration and a syRem of
government both flexible and consiRcnt, neither the
central nor the outlying provinces could be ruled from
Delhi or anywhere else. Even before the sultan’s
death, Bengal, the Deccan, and Malabar had begun
to break away, and in spite of the talents of his cousin
and successor, FIriSz Shdh (1351-88), the preRige of

23



SELECTIONS FROM THE

Delhi rapidly decayed, and the dismemberment of
India for the profit of petty princes continued un-
checked.

The malady from which India was suffering had
broken out again with redoubled violence ^in ‘Iraq
and Persia on the extinflion of the Mongol Ilkhanate
in 1336. The hopes that their conversion had raised,
the promise of a government able and willing to give
commerce and agriculture a chance of recovery, were
savagely betrayed. It would have mattered little to
the people who or which of the amirs seized the sove-
reignty, but the division of the empire between a
dozen quarrelling amirs spelled ruin and disa^er.
Here and there, no doubt, were islands of prosperity;
Ibn Battuta speaks of one such on the Euphrates above
Anbar. But the moft serious feature was that the
population under these repeated bludgeonings had
lo^ heart, and a few years of anarchy now resulted in
more depopulation than a century of anarchy had
formerly caused.

Nor was Egypt exempt from the general decline.
The death of Nasir in 1341 opened the door to a
prolonged series of dynamic disputes. No fewer than
eight of his sons were thru^ upon the throne between
1341 and 135^5 though the druggies over the
succession involved only the Mamldk soldiery and
not the people as a whole, yet at a time of repeated
changes of government the wretched subjefts naturally
suffered more severely than from the calculated ex-
tortions of a settled regime, and the disordered ^ate
of the kingdom is sufficiently indicated by the diminu-
tion of the revenues.

Even yet the cup of misery was not full. In 1348
the Muslim lands were swept by the fir^t outbreak of
^e devouring pe^lilence known as the “ Black Death.”
The extent of its ravages there will never be fully
known, but, from the figures given by Ibn Battfita

24



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

(see Chapter XII.) and in other sources, the loss of
life during the visitation itself and in the famine which
accompanied it was certainly appalling. In a young
and vigorous society the effefts of such a disaster soon
disappear; but where the social order is already reeling,
many decades are required before equilibrium can be
regained. This respite was not granted to the Isldmic
world. A generation later, in I 38 ij the visitation
was repeated, with as terrible effeft, and before the
horror of it passed from men's minds the whirlwind
from Central Asia swept once more over all the Muslim
lands from Delhi to Damascus and Smyrna, when
Ti'miir, who called himself a fclfow-Muslim, reduced
to walte and ashes what two invasions of the heathen


Mongols and two visitations of the Plague had spared.

There is one other aspeft of the history of this
period which deserves a short reference. It may
cause surprise that Ibn Battfita, though he regularly
calls the Christians infidels or heathens, rarely betrays
any animosity towards them, and even travels on
Genoese and Catalan vessels. The inconsiilcncy is
explained by the several relations in which the Muslims
^ood to the ChriAians. The Sacred Law of IsUm


places all ChriAians in one of two categories: native
ChriAian communities, living peacefully in Muslim
lands with their own social organization, but definitely
inferior in Aatus; and unsubdued ChriAian Aates
with which the Muslim Aate is theoretically at war.
In general, therefore, its attitude, and that of the
Muslims, to ChriAians was either hoAile or frigidly
aloof. But Muslim and ChriAian met on a third
footing, which the Canon Law had not envisaged and
which the religious authorities on either side vainly
tried to oppose. When the Normans had wreAed the
command of the Mediterranean from the Arabs in
the eleventh century, the commercial expansion of the
Italian republics and of Roussillon led to the con-


25



SELECTIONS FROM THE

elusion of trading agreements with the INduslim ^ates
and the foundation of trading Nations in their ports.
Though for mutual safety and convenience the Chris-
tian traders were subjedf to certain reftriftions, such
as the Muslims themselves were subjeft to in China,
all these economic negotiations were transadfed on
the basis of complete equality and mutual respeft.
This friendliness, in spite of the frequency of piracy
on both sides, was maintained on the whole until the
sixteenth century, and is refledled in Ibn Battdta’s
relations with the Chri^ian traders and during his
visit to Con^antinople.


§ 3. THE RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND OF IBN BATTUTA’s

TRAVELS

To the Muslim world in general, however, political
events, though not devoid of intere^l, were matters of
minor import. The medieval Muslim society was
above all a religious society. To religion it owed its
exigence, for the religion of Islam was its sole bond
of union. To religion it owed its common language
of intercourse, for Islam intervened to prevent the
dissolution of Arabic into local dialedls, and imposed
a knowledge of Arabic on Persians and Turks. To
religion it owed its heritage of literature, for religion
had supplied the incentive to those studies out of which
Arabic literature (poetry alone excepted) arose. To
religion it owed its social organization and its Jaws,
for Islam had built up a new legal system, obliterating,
at leaft in all the civilized lands, the old social organi-
zations and social inequalities. To religion it owed
its corporate feeling, for Isldm gave to every believer
^e sense of common fellowship in its universal
Brotherhood. Religion, in fine, not only created the
cultural background and psychological orientation of
Muslim society, but supplied for its members a philo-

26



TRAVELS OF IBN BATT'OTA

sophy of living and ordained even the lea^ aftivities
of their daily life.

The whole of Arabic literature reflefts these social
circum^lanccs by an insi^ence on religious values and
an interest in matters of religion, which is apt to make
heavy demands on the patience and knowledge of
modern readers. This naturally applies with special
force to Ibn Battdta’s book, no version of which can
possibly exclude all allusions to religious subjedls.
For this reason it may lighten the English reader*s
way to give here some account of the religious infti-
tutions of Islim and the organizations which sprang
up on Isidmic soil.

The general beliefs of IsUm require little explana-
tion. The central dogma is that there is but One
God, Creator of heaven and earth. Who alone is to
be worshipped, the absolute Maftcr of all His
creatures, whose lives He has, in His inscrutable
l^ve and Wisdom, foreordained, and whom He shall
judge on the laA awful Day. For their guidance He
has raised up a succession of Prophets, the line of
which, beginning with Adam, and continued through
Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus,
together with an unnumbered hoil of minor Prophets,
culminated in Muhammad. The doftrine preached
by all these Prophets is essentially one and the same,
with slight modifications for time and place, namely
hlanty or self-surrender to the Will or God. It is
set forth in a series of verbally inspired books given
by Divine Revelation to several of the Prophets,
notably the Torah (Pentateuch) to Moses, the Psalms
to David, the Evangel (which is not exaftly the Gospels
of the New Testament) to Jesus, and the Koran — the
final and perfect repository of the Divine Word — to
Muhammad. Such revelations were made not direftly
to the Prophet, but transmitted through the Archangel
Gabriel. In addition to men and angels, there is a
27



SELECTIONS FROM THE

third class of created beings, namely the Jinn, who
being made of fire have bodies more subtle than those
of men, and possess superhuman powers, but, like
men, shall be called to account on the Day of
Judgment.

But Islam is much more than the mere affirmation
of certain beliefs. No one has fully earned the name
of Muslim who does not also carry out with regularity
the religious duties imposed upon him. The main
“Pillars of the Faith” are four: (i) The five daily
prayer-rituals, each made up of a fixed number of
repetitions of a uniform series -of bodily poftures and
recitations, with the face towards the qibla^ i.e. Mecca,
The prayers are to be performed either congrega-
tionally or in private at Elated hours : ju^ before sun-
rise, ju^ after noon, in mid-afternoon, ju^ after sunset,
and two or three hours after nightfall. Congrega-
tional praj^ers are performed in a mosque and are led
by one (it is immaterial which one) of the worshippers.
In the mosque there are no images, no paintings,
nothing to di^radl the mind of the au^ere monotheist
from concentration on the adt of devotion. At moSt
the yalls may be decorated with a tracery of geo-
metocal designs, whose endless interlacings may
perhaps serve to weary the outward vision and give
ruller play to the inner spiritual perceptions. The
principal congregational service of the week, which is
tieid only in ‘ cathedral ” mosques, is the noon prayer
on riday, when, in addition to the ordinary ritual
prayers, the official Preacher of the mosque delivers
rorn t e pulpit a formal Khutha or allocution, con-
taming inter alia prayers for the reigning ruler, fol-
Iqwed usually by a sermon or exhortation (mawHzJ).

TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

pray the worshipper mu^l in every case be in a ^ate
of ritual purity, which is ensured by the formal ablu-
tion of face, arms, and feet at the fountain provided
in every mosque. (2) The payment of a fixed alms-
tax on all property, averaging two and a half per cent,
annually. (3) The observance of the annual fa^l
during the month of Ramadan, i.e. complete abstinence
from all food and drink (including nowadays smoking)
between the hours of sunrise and sunset for the period
of one lunar month. (4) For those who are of age
and have the means to carry it out, the obligation to
make the Pilgrimage to Mecca at leaSt once in a
lifetime.

Besides its dogmatics and its religious praftices,
Isldm includes a complete legal and social syStem,
based on the Koran and the Hadith — the sayings and
aftipns attributed to the Prophet. This IslSmic Law
was expounded b^ four schools of juri^ls in the second
and third centuries of the Muslim era. The schools
differ only in minor points of interpretation, and all
are regarded as equally orthodox. The Law was
administered by the and in the capital cities of
the Eafl there was usually a supreme qSdl for each
rite. In praflicc criminal aftions were often decided
by the Sultan or his officers and sometimes legalized
by the formal assent of a qddl. The point at which
the social sySiem of Islam diverges mo 5 l radically
from European syftems is found in the sphere of
marriage and divorce. It is commonly known that
a Muslim may possess up to four wives at one time in
addition to slave concubines, and that he is at liberty,
subjeft to certain none too rigorous legal safeguards,
to divorce the former at will, and to dispose of the
latter unless- they have borne him male children.
Such provisions were admirably suited to a roving life,
and Ibn Battdta took full advantage of them. Details
that no European — far less any Chri^lian clergyman —
29



SELECTIONS FROM THE

would communicate are set down by him quite simply
and naturally, since they ^and in a measure, outside
the moral field, in a category not unlike that of eating
and drinking. One should not, however, draw over-
hafty conclusions from the casual manner in which
Ibn Battfita speaks of his wives. It is not good
manners for a Muslim to refer to his womenfolk in
ordinary social intercourse, and when, on rare occa-
sions, Ibn Battiita breaks through the convention, it
is generally no more than a brief explanatory reference
made in connection with some other circumClance.

In regard to a second feature of the Muslim social
sy^em, the practice of slavery, it is important to bear
in mind that the slave was generally the body-servant
or retainer of his master, and that slavery was in no
sense the economic basis of Muslim society. Ma^er
and slave thus ^ood in a more humane relationship
than did the slave cultivator to the Roman landed
proprietor or the American planter. There was
consequently less stigma attaching to slavery, and in
no other society has there been anything resembling
the sy^em by which, as has been shown in the pre-
ceding seClion, the white slaves came to furnish the
privileged cadres whence the high officers of ^ate,
commanders, governors, and at length even sultans,
were almo^ exclusively drawn.

The following ^ory, told by a theologian of the
third century, represents without serious di^ortion the
relations, which, as numerous parallels in Arabic
literature indicate, often exiCled between ma^er, wife,
and slave.

I saw a slave-boy being auClioned for thirty dinars,
and as he was worth three hundred I bought him*.
I was building a house at the time, and I gave him
twenty dinars to lay out on the workmen. He spent
en on them and bought a garment for himself with
e other ten. I said to him “ What’s this ?” to which

30



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

he replied “Don’t be ha5ly; no gentleman scolds his
slaves.” I said to myself “ Here have I bought the
Caliph’s tutor without knowing it” Later on I
wanted to marry a woman unknown to my cousin
(j.e. my fir£l wife), so I swore him to secrecy and gave
him a dindr to buy some things, including some of the
fish called hdzibd. But he bought something else,
and when I was WTOth with him he said “ I find that
Hippocrates disapproves of hdzibd.” I said to him
“ 1 ou worthless fool, I was not aware that I had bought
a Galen,” and gave him ten blows with the whip. But
he seized me and gave me seven back saying, “ Sir,
three blows is enough as a punishment, and the seven
I gave you are my rightful retaliation.” So I made
at him and gave him a cut on the head, whereupon he
went off to my cousin, and said to her “ Sincerity is
a religious duty, and whoever deceives us is not one of
us. My maflcr has married and he swore me to
silence, and when I said to him that my lady mufl be
told of it he broke my head.” So my cousin would
neither let me into the house nor let me have anything
out of it, until at laA I had to divorce the other woman.
After that she used to call the boy “ The honedl lad,”
and I could not say a word to him, so I said to myself
“ I shall set him free, and then I shall have peace."

The mo^ original features of the IslAmic system are
to be found in its religious organizations, of which there
were two, to some extent rivals of one another. The
official religious system of Isidm excludes the concep-
tion of a clergy, and consequently of a hierarchy.
There are no sacraments. All believers dland on
an equal footing in matters of religion, and none is
entitled to claim any spiritual fundlions which are not
shared by every member of the community. In aftual
practice, however, it was impossible to maintain the
theory of equality. Where a society is bound up with
a religious system, the cleric, the expounder of dodirine,

31



SELECTIONS FROM THE

the arbiter on points of law, inevitably e^ablishes
a moral predominance over his more ignorant fellows,
that is none the less real or even tyrannical because it
has no outward legal support. The mere maintenance
of the religious sy^em thus called into being a religious
ari^ocracy, as we have already termed the body of
theologians, differing, however, from the Christian
hierarchy in that the elaborate gradations of the
latter were unknown, that it had no spiritual pre-
rogatives, and was open to all without seeking any
man's leave or taking any vows. For the re^l, the
sy^em had much the same merits and defefts as a
prie^hood, though the theologians of Islam generally
held more aloof from the civil administration than did
the Christian hierarchy, and adopted an attitude which
in the long run produced disastrous effedts on both
church and civil government. In the political field
their influence was mainly negative. Since it devolved
upon the community as a whole to ensure the obser-
vance of the Faith, the theologians soon found that
they could use their influence to mould public opinion
and create of it a weapon with which to intimidate
law-breakers and keep in check local autocrats and
tyrants. It was rarely that even the moSl despotic
ruler ventured to brave the public disapproval, as may
be seen from some of the Stories related by Ibn
Battfita. On the other hand the example of Sultan
Muhammad of Delhi is sufficient to show that when
the ruler was aStute enough to humour the theologians
with his left hand, there were few who dared enquire
too closely into what he did with his right.

On the^ community as a whole was laid yet another
duty, which could not be delegated to the pro-
fessional theologians, the duty of defending by the
^ord the^ territorial and religious heritage of Islam.
The ’Jihad ^ which was reckoned by some juriSls
as an obligation of the same degree as prayer and

TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

failing, and in the early days had indeed been the
conilant occupation of every Muslim, in a form more
offensive than defensive, was revived by the Crusades
and the Chriilian rcconqueil in Spain. No longer,
however, was it regarded as the personal duty of every
Muslim to take up arms for the defence of Isldm, and
for the moil part the Syrians and Andalusians were
left to defend their territories by themselves. Never-
theless, the inducement of Paradise, held out as the
reward of the martyr who dies fighting for the Faith,
was ilrong enough to maintain a ileady movement of
volunteers to the theatres of war againA the Chriilian
or heathen. These volunteers lived on the frontier
in forts or fortified lines called by the name of rihdt
(which means literally “ pickets ”), and were known
as Qhdzii or MurdhUSy the ncarcil English equivalent
for which is “mounted frontiersmen.” By the four-
teenth century it was probably only in Andalusia
that the inilitudon preserved its primitive charafler.
Elsewhere it had developed along two very different
lines. On the one hand the fighting life attrafled all
the moft turbulent elements in the Muslim empire,
and the Ghdzfs rapidly degenerated into bands of
condottieri and brigands, a source of much greater
vexation to Muslim rulers than to the infidels.

On the other hand it was associated with the rise
of the ascetic and my^ical movement within Isldm.
Early Muslim asceticism was dominated by fear of
Hell. Since death on Jihdd was the only sure passport
to Paradise, it came about that in the early days ascetics
had generally taken a prominent part in the frontier
warfare. Later on Jihdd was interpreted to apply to
the inward and spiritual dlruggle againdl the tempta-
tions of the worla, and the S^is (as the mydlics were
now called) withdrew from secular warfare, but
retained the old terminology. The ribdt was now the
ascetic’s hermitage or the convent or hospice where
33 D



SELECTIONS FROM THE

the devotees congregated to live the religious life. In
course of time the loose primitive associations became
linked up in an organization which tended to grow
more elaborate and hierarchical, with ascending grades
of spiritual perception and power. We may here,
however, omit the details of this my^ical hierarchy,
and pass at once to examine the working of the sufi
or darwish orders in the fourteenth century, and their
relations with the theologians.

In general the followers of the mystic’s path were by
this time grouped in congregations, called after some
eminent shaykh, who was regarded as the founder of
the tariqa or rule, including the ritual litany, which,
as will be explained shortly, was one of the distin-
guishing marks of each congregation. Round the
convent of the founder rose a girdle of daughter
houses, as disciples of the order spread throughout the
Muslim world, and in moSt cases all the members
looked up to the descendants or successors of the
founder (for in Islam asceticism does not imply celi-
bacy) as their head. The older individualist asceticism
was not yet extindt, however, and everywhere, but
especially in North-weSt Africa and in Mt. Lebanon,
were to be found recluses who were completely inde-
pendent of the darwish orders, though they also often
claimed spiritual affiliation with and descent from the
great Sdfi leaders of the early centuries. Still more
freely, outside the walls of convent or cell, roamed
nurnbers of darwishes or faqirSy affiliated and non-
affiliated, distinguished by the patched robe, wallet,
and Staff, who scorned to earn so much as a mite by
their own labours, truSting to the Providence of God
and the charity of the Faithful, and who at times
displayed an importunity and effrontery more easily
associated with professional mendicants than pious
“ almsmen.” ^

The fundamental aim of the Siifi life, however or

34



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

wherever lived, was to pierce the veils of human sense
which shut man off from the Divine and so attain to
communion with and absorption into God. Their
days and nights were spent in prayer and contempla-
tion, in failing and ascetic exercises. At frequent
intervals all the inhabitants of the convent, or the
local members of the fcr/yc, met to celebrate the ritual
litany, the dhikr^ according to their peculiar rites. The
dhikr was intended to produce a hypnotic effeft on the
participants and so allow them to tailc momentarily
the joys of reunion with the Divine. With that
extravagance which accompanies all expression of
rising emotion in Eaflern life and thought, the litany
in mo^l cases passed into a fantaRic exhibition of
marvellous or thaumaturgical feats, such as Ibn
Battdta describes on seve^ occasions. Some would
whirl and pirouette for hours at a time, others would
chew serpents or glass, walk in fire, or thru^l knives
through their limbs, without any worse effe^ls than at
mofl a temporary nervous exhauftion.

The faculty of self-torture without inflidling visible
injury, which is amply vouched for by modern
travellers who have witnessed the lamentations of the
Shi'itcs for the death of Husayn, or, like the late Lord
Curzon, have attended the stances of the Tsawfya
darwlshes in North-weil Africa, leads up to a related
and difficult queflion. All European commentators
of Ibn Battdta have referred to his credulity, his fond-
ness for the miraculous and uncritical acceptance of
reported miracles worked by the famous shaykhs and
saints whom he met. His powers of belief are not,
however, entirely unlimited, as may be seen from the
doubts which he expresses on more than one occasion
in regard to extravagant claims. The Glories of
miracles which he relates at secondhand do him no
discredit; the power of saints to perform miracles was
and ^lill is believed by the mass of Muslims, and such

35



SELECTIONS FROM THE

tales intere^ed both narrator and audience. It is
when he tells of miraculous events direftly associated
with himself that the problem of their truth mu^ be
definitely faced. In some cases it may be possible to
explain them by hypnotism (if that in fad “ explains ”
them), as the Muslim theologian explained the Chinese
magician’s tricks at Hang-chow; in others, we may
susped the arts of the conjurer; but there is a residue,
including, for example, the account of his escape after
his capture at Koel in India, where we mud either
accept the miraculous element or give the lie dired
to the traveller. To the naturalidic and mechanidic
mind of the nineteenth century the choice was simple,
as it is dill to those who charge Ibn Battdta with
wholesale invention in regard to his travels. But
the twentieth-century reader has greater faith in the
powers of God and man, and while he may remain
critical he will not rejed a priori any narrative that
involves the “miraculous.” There can be no doubt
that in certain orders, at lead, the severe bodily and
mental training undergone by a darwish as he advances
to the higher grades of initiation is accompanied by an
expansion of mental powers, beginning with dmple
telepathy. The doubting reader may be referred to
an illuminating account by Professor D. B. Macdonald
{Aspeiis of Islam^ p. 170) of an ex-darwlsh converted
to Chridianity who dill retained his telepathic gifts.
The only prudent course, it would seem, is to suspend
judgment, and in the meantime give Ibn Battdta the
credit for relating what he at lead believed to be the
truth.

It is a little surprising, however, to find him so
deeply intereded in and so sympathetic in general
towards^ the darwishes and Stafis. - The average
theologian regarded them with suspicion, if not with
aversion, for various reasons, religious and secular,
while the mydic in turn frequently despised the



TRAVELS OF IB N BATTOTA

theologian for his formalism and cult of the letter.
The firA point of issue between them dealt with the
nature of religious knowledge. To the theologians,
there was but one road to the apprehension of truth,
V/n or savtir^ the science of tncology, with all its
scholaftic appurtenances involved in the ^udy of
the Koran and the Traditions of the Prophet. The
darsvlsh, on the other hand, sought na'rifa or (onttais-
sancCi that direft knowledge of God, which in his view
was often aftually hindered by the fludy of theology*.
Sufism showed an antinomian tendency which could
not but excite the disapprobation of the IcgaliA, who
sought and found satisla^lion for his religious inAinfls
in the ritual duties prescribed by the baith. More-
over the reverence accorded by the disciple to his
shaykh when alive, and the elevation of former shaykhs
to the rank of saints, to whom Invocations were
addressed, seemed to the theologian to deAroy the
non-saccrdotal principle, and even to trespass into
polytheism, the one mortal sin in IsUm. At firA the
breach between theologian and Siifi had been much
wider, but in course of time the popular influence
enjoyed by the Siifis forced the theologians, however
unwillingly, to terms in the matter of saint-worship.
The success of the SOfIs in legitimating their praAiccs
was possibly not a little due to pressure exertea outside
the purely religious field. They formed, as has been
seen, a rival religious organization, and it is evident
that some of the hoAility felt by the theologians was
due to competition for popular favour and support.
As the balance of popularity turned in favour of the
Sdfis, especially with the influx of the Turkish element
into the social and political life of Islim, the theologians
found it necessary to admit much that th<w had formerly
rcsiAcd and perhaps continued to chafe at. By the
fourteenth century their capitulation was complete,
when the laA outAanding opponent of the Siifi heresies,

SELECTIONS FROM THE

that Ibn Taymiya whom I bn Battiita saw in Damascus,
and whom he speaks of as “ having a bee in his bonnet,”
was silenced. But the ho^ility remained, now more,
now less openly shown. In North-we^l Africa it seems
to have been much weaker than elsewhere, possibly
because of the ftrong inherited attachment of the
Berbers, which they ^ill show, to the principle of local
sanctuaries and “ holy men,” islamized under the name
of murdbits (“ marabouts ”). This may serve to ex-
plain why Ibn Battuta, trained theologian as he was,
^ill had all a Berber’s interest in the holy men whom
he met on his travels.

The antagonism between legi^ and follower of the
Inner Light was, however, unimportant by com-
parison with the hatred engendered by the Great
Schism of Islam, the division between Sunni and Sht’ite,
The Shi‘ite movement began in the firCl century of
Islam as political propaganda againCf the Umayyad
dyna^y of Caliphs in favour of the house of ‘AH, the
son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet. It was then
hand in glove with the orthodox, and succeeded both
in impressing its hiClorical point of view on orthodox
sentiment and in overthrowing the hated dyna^y,
only to be cheated of its political hopes by the eftablish-
ment of the rival ‘Abbasid line, and to fall inClead'under
a more methodical persecution than hitherto. Shi'ism
now took to the catacombs, and soon became a separate
heretical seft, diftinguished by the doClrine of alle-
giance to a divinely appointed, sinless, and infallible
spiritual leader, the Imam, in^ead of an eleClive lay
head or Caliph. The Imamate they held to be heredi-
tary in the house of ‘AH, but the various sub-groups
differed on the point at which the succession of Imams
^^s^^i^^terrupted. The belief of the principal group,
or ^ Twelvers,” to which the Shi‘ites of Persia and
‘Iraq ^ill belong, was that the twelfth Imam of the
line disappeared about the year 873 into a cave at

HilJa, but that he continues, through the heads of
the religious organization, to provide spiritual and
temporal guidance for his people, and will reappear
as the promised Mahdl to bnng the long reign of
tyranny to an end. This Grange doctrine of a
“Hidden Imdm” or “Expelled Imdm,” often re-
ferred to as the “ Mafler or the Age,” is recalled by
the ceremony at Hilla, of which Ibn Battdta gives a
graphic description.

Shi'ism has always shown a much stronger seftarian
tendency than orthodox IsUm, and was diflinguished
from its earlieA days by the number and variety of
its offshoots. The general tendency of the sefts was
to. adopt, under the influence of various syncreti^l
philosophies, dlill more extreme views on the person
of ‘AH and his descendants, even to the extent of
defying them. Such GhuUt or “ Extremidls ” seem
to have found special favour in Syria where, indeed,
two of the largefl of these communities are Aill to
be found, the Druse and the Nusayris (now called
‘Alawfs), alongside the majority Shi‘itcs of the Twelvers
seft, locally known as MutawdHs. From the same
cause arises its intolerance. The Shi'ite hates, where
the Sunni merely despises. His hatred is by no means
reserved for non-Muslims, but is freely bellowed
upon the other Isldmic sefts, especially upon the Siifls,
whose views admit of no reconciliation with the ponti-
fical sydlem of Shi‘ism. With such feelings on the
one side reciprocated on the other, it is not surprising
to find a conAant feud raging in Syria, in spite of the
efforts of the Mamlfik governors. Over and over in
Ibn Battiita’s work the reader will note traces of the
enmity that divided Sunni from Shi'ite, not lea^l in
the writer’s personal animosity, which shows in the
substitution of the opprobrious Rdfidhi or “ Refuser,”
for Shi'ite or ‘Alawl. The explanation of this term
is to be found in a praftice adopted by the Shi'ites, as
39



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTCTA

a logical consequence of their Imdmate theory. Hold-
ing that ‘AH alone had the right to succeed his cousin
Muhammad, they regard the three Caliphs who
reigned before him as usurpers and traitors, and
sub^itute a curse for the blessing which the pious
Sunni Muslim pronounces after the names of these
the closest companions of the Prophet — a deliberate
insult which naturally arouses the indignation of the
Sunnis in a far greater degree than their more theoretical
dogmatic heresies.

BOOK I


CHAPTER I

I LEFT Tangier, my birthplace, on Thursday, 2nd
Rajab, 725 [14th June, 1325], being at that time
twenty-two [lunar] years of age,* with the intention
of making the Pilgrimage to ^e Holy House [at
Mecca] and the Tomb of the Prophet [at Madina].
I set out alone, finding no companion to cheer the way
with friendly intercourse, and no party of travellers
with whom to associate myself. Swayed by an over-
mailering impulse within me, and a long-cherished
desire to visit those glorious sanftuaries, I resolved
to quit all my friends and tear mvsclf away from my
home. As my parents were Aill alive, it weighed
grievously upon me to part from them, and both they
and I were afflifled with sorrow.

On reaching the’ city of Tilimsdn [Tlcmsen], whose
sultan at that time was Abii Tdshifin,’ I found there
two ambassadors of the Sultan of Tunis, who left the
city on the same day that I arrived. One of the
brethren having advised me to accompany them, I
consulted the will of God in this matter,® and after
a dlay of three days in the city to procure all that I
needed, I rode after them with all speed. I overtook
them at the town of Milidna, where we dtayed ten
days, as both ambassadors fell sick on account of the
summer heats. When wc set out again, one of them
grew worse, and died after we had flopped for three
nights by a dlream four miles from Milidna. I left
their party there and pursued my journey, with a
company of merchants from Tunis. On reaching
43



SELECTIONS FROM THE

al-Jaza’ir [Algiers] we halted outside the town for
a few days, until the former party rejoined us, when
we went on together through the Mitija^ to the moun-
tain of Oaks [Jurjdra] and so reached Bijdya [Bougie].®
The commander of Bijaya at this time was the chanaber-
lain Ibn Sayyid an-Nds. Now one of the Tunisian
merchants of our party had died leaving three thousand
dinars of gold, which he had entru^ed to a certain
man of Algiers to deliver to his heirs at Tunis. Ibn
Sayyid an-Nds came to hear of this and forcibly seized
the money. This was the firdl instance I witnessed
of the tyranny of the agents of the Tunisian govern-
ment. At Bijdya I fell ill of a fever, and one of my
friends advised me to dtay there till I recovered.
But I refused, saying, “ If God decrees my death, it
shall be on the road with my face set toward Mecca.”
“ If that is your resolve,” he replied, “ seU your ass
and your heavy baggage, and I shall lend you what
you require. In this way you will travel light, for
we mu^ make ha^e on our journey, for fear of meeting
roving Arabs on the way.”® I followed his advice and
he did as he had promised — may God reward him !
On reaching Qusantinah [Con^antine] we camped
outside the town, but a heavy rain forced us to leave
our tents during the night and take refuge in some
houses there. Next day the governor of the city
came to meet us. Seeing my clothes all soiled by the
rain he gave orders that they should be washed at his
house, and in place of my old worn headcloth sent
me a headcloth of fine Syrian cloth, in one of the ends
of which he had tied two gold dinars. This was the
fir^t alms I received on my journey. From Qusan-
tinah we reached Bona where, after laying in the
town for several days, we left the merchants of our
party on account of the dangers of the road, while
we pursued our journey with the utmost speed. I.
was again attacked by fever, so I tied myself in the

44

saddle with a turban>cIoth in case I should fall by
reason of. my weakness. So great was my fear that
I could not dismount until we arrived at Tunis. The
population of the city came out to meet the members
of our party, and on all sides greetings and que^ions
were exchanged, but not a soul greeted me as no one
there was known to me. I was so affefted by my
loneliness that I could not rcilrain my tears and wept
bitterly, until one of the pilgrims realized the cause
of my distress and coming up to me greeted me kindly
and continued to entertain me with friendly talk until
I entered the ci^.

The Sultan of Tunis at that time was Abii Yahyd,
the son of Abii Zakariya II., and there were a number
of notable scholars in the town.’ During my ^lay the
festival of the Breaking of the Fail fell due, and I
joined the company at the Praying-ground.® The
inhabitants assembled in large numbers to celebrate
the feilival, maki^ a brave show and wearing their
richeil apparel. . The Sultan Abii Yahyd arrived on
horseback, accompanied by all his relatives, courtiers,
and officers of ilate walking on foot in a ilately pro-
cession. After the recital of the prayer and the
conclusion of the Allocution the people returned to
their homes.

Some time later the pilgrim caravan for the Hijdz
was formed, and they nominated me as their qddl
(judge). We left Tunis early in November, following
the coail road through Si!ba, Sfax, and Qdbis,® where
we flayed for ten days on account of incessant rains.
Thence we set out for Tripoli, accompanied for several
^ages by a hundred or more horsemen as well as a
detachment of archers, out of respefl for whom- the
Arabs kept their distance. I had made a contrail of
marriage at Sfax with the daughter of one of the
syndics at Tunis, and at Tripoli she Was conducted
to me, but after leaving Tripoli I became involved

45



SELECTIONS FROM THE

in a dispute with her father, which necessitated my
separation from her. I then married the daughter of
a ftudent from Fez, and when she was conduced to
me I detained the caravan for a day by entertaining
them all at a wedding party.

At length on April 5th (1326) we reached iUex-
andria. It is a beautiful city, well-built and fortified
with four gates^° and a magnificent port. Among all
the ports in the world I have seen none to equal it
except Kawlam [QuUon] and Calicfit in India, the
port of the infidels [Genoese] at Sudaq in the land of
the Turks, and the port of Zaytdn in China, all of
which will be described later. I went to see the light-
house on this occasion and found one of its faces in
ruins. It is a very high square building, and its door
is above the level of the earth. Opposite the door,
and of the same height, is a building from which there
is a plank bridge to the door; if this is removed there
is no means of entrance. Inside the door is a place
for the lighthouse-keeper, and within the lighthouse
there are many chambers. The breadth of the passage
inside is nine spans and that of the wall ten spans;
each of the four sides of the lighthouse is 140 spans
in breadth. It is situated on a high mound and lies
three miles from the city on a long tongue of land
which juts out into the sea from close by the city wall,
so that the lighthouse cannot be reached by land
except from the city. On my return to the We^
in the year 750^ [1349] I visited the lighthouse again,
and found that it had fallen into so ruinous a condition
that it was not possible to enter it or climb up to the
door.^^ Al-Malik an-Nasir had Parted to build a
similar lighthouse alongside it but was prevented by
death from completing the work. Another of the-
marvellous things in this city is the awe-inspiring
marble column in its outskirts which they call the

Pillar of Columns.” It is a single block, skilfully

carved, crefted on a plinth of square Clones like enor-
mous platforms, and no one knows how it was crcflcd
there nor for certain who creeled it.“

One of the learned men of Alexandria was the qddf,
a mailer of eloquence, who used to wear a turban of
extraordinary size. Never either in the cailcrn or the
wcilcrn lands have I seen a more voluminous head-
gear. Another of them was the pious ascetic Burhdn
ad-Dfn, whom I met during my ilay and whose
hospitality I enjoyed for three days. One day as I
entered his room he said to me “ I see that you are
fond of travelling through foreign lands.” I replied
“ Yes, I am ” (though I had as yet no thought of going
to such diilant lands as India or China). Then he
said *' You muil certainly visit my brother” Farid
ad-Dln in India, and my brother Rukn ad-Dfn in
Sind, and my brother Burhdn ad-Din in China, and
when you find them give them greeting from me.”

I was amazed at his prediflion, and the idea of going
to these countries having been cail into my mind, my
journeys never ceased until 1 had met these three that
he named and conveyed his greeting to them.

During my ^ay at Alexandria 1 had heard of the

{ )ious Shaykh aI-Murshidl,who bellowed gifts miracu-
ously created at his desire. He lived in solitary
retreat in a cell in the country where he was visited
by princes and ministers. Parties of men in all ranks
of Jjfc used to come to him every day and he would
supply them all with food. Each one of them would
desire to cat some flesh or fruit or sweetmeat at his
cell, and to each he would give what he had suggested,
though it was frequently out of season. His fame was
carried from mouth to mouth far and wide, and the
Sultan too had visited him several times in his retreat.

I set out from Alexandria to seek this shaykh and
passing through DamanhiSr came to Fawwd [Fua],
a beautiful township, dose by which, separated from
47



SELECTIONS FROM THE

it by a canal, lies the shaykh’s cell. I reached this
cell about mid-afternoon, and on saluting the shaykh
I found that he had with him one of the sultan’s
aides-de-camp, who had encamped with his troops
ju^ outside. The shaykh rose and embraced me, and
calling for food invited me to eat. When the hour
of the afternoon prayer arrived he set me in front as
prayer-leader, and did the same on every occasion
when we were together at the times of prayer during
my ^fay. When I wished to sleep he said to me
“ Go up to the roof of the cell and sleep there ” (this
was during the summer heats). I said to the officer
“ In the name of God,”^^ but he replied [quoting from
the Koran] “ There is none of us but has an appointed
place.” So I mounted to the roof and found there
a ^raw mattress and a leather mat, a water vessel for
ritual ablutions, a jar of water and a drinking-cup, and
I lay down there to sleep.

That night, while I was sleeping on the roof of the
cell, I dreamed that I was on the wing of a great bird
which was flying with me towards Mecca, then to
Yemen, then ea^wards, and thereafter going towards
the south, then flying far eastwards, and finally landing
in a, dark and green country, where it left me. I
was aftonished at this dream and said to myself “ If
the shaykh can interpret my dream for me, he is all
that they say he is.” Next morning, after all the
other visitors had gone, he called me and when I had
related my dream interpreted it to me saying: “You
will make the pilgrimage [to Mecca] and visit [the
Tomb o^ the Prophet, and you will travel through'
Yemen, ‘Iraq, the country of the Turks, and India.
You will ^lay there for a long time and meet there
my brother Dilshad the Indian, who will rescue you
from a danger into which you will fall.” Then he
gave me a travelling-provision of small cakes and
money, and I bade him farewell and departed. Never

since parting from him have I met on my journeys
aught but good fortune, and his blessings have ^lood
me in good ^ead.

We rode from here to Damietta through a number
of towns, in each of which we visited the principal men
of religion. Damietta lies on the bank of the Nile,
and the people in the houses next to the river draw
water from it in buckets. Many of the houses have
^leps leading down to the river. Their sheep and
goats are allowed to pa^lure at liberty day and night;
for this reason the saying goes of Damietta “ Its walls
are sweetmeats and its dogs are sheep.” Anyone
who enters the city may not afterwards leave it except
by the governor’s seal. Persons of repute have a
seal damped on a piece of paper so that they may
show it to the gatekeepers; other persons have the seal
stamped on their forearms. In this city there are
many seabirds with extremely greasy flesh, and the
milk of its buffaloes is unequalled for sweetness and
pleasant taile. The fish called biiri“ is exported
thence to Syria, Anatolia, and Cairo. The present
town is of recent con^truftion; the old city was that
de^lroycd by the Franks in the time of al-Malik
as-Siiih.“

From Damietta I travelled to Fariskiir, which is
a town on the bank of the Nile, and halted outside
it. Here I was overtaken by a horseman who had
been sent after me by the governor of Damietta. He
handed me a number of coins, saying to me “The
Governor asked for you, and on being informed about
you, he sent you this gift ” — may God reward him !
Thence I travelled to AshmiSn, a large and ancient
town on a canal derived from the Nile. It possesses
a wooden bridge at which all vessels anchor, and in
the afternoon the baulks are lifted and the vessels
pass up and down. From here I went to Samanniid,
whence I journeyed upstream to Cairo, between a

continuous succession of towns and villages. The
traveller on the Nile need take no provision with him,
because whenever he desires to descend on the bank
he may do so, for ablutions, prayers, provisioning, or
any other purpose. There is an uninterrupted chain
of bazaars from Alexandria to Cairo, and from Cairo
to Assuan in Upper Egypt.

I arrived at length at Cairo, mother of cities and
seat of Pharaoh the tyrant, mi^ress of broad regions
and fruitful lands, boundless in multitude of buildings,
peerless in beauty and splendour, the meeting-place
of comer and goer, the halting-place of feeble and
mighty, whose throngs surge as the waves of the sea,
and can scarce be contained in her for all her size
and capacity.^^ It is said that in Cairo there are
twelve thousand water-carriers who transport water on
camels, and thirty thousand hirers of mules and
donkeys, and that on the Nile there are thirty-six
thousand boats belonging to the Sultan, and his sub-
jefts, which sail up^lream to Upper Egypt and down-
^ream to Alexandria and Damietta, laden with goods
and profitable merchandise of all kinds. On the
bank of the Nile opposite Old Cairo is the place known
as The Garden^^ which is a pleasure park and prome-
nade, containing many beautiful gardens, for the
people of Cairo are given to pleasure and amusements.
I witnessed a fete once in Cairo for the sultan’s re-
covery from a fra£lured hand; all the merchants
decorated their bazaars and had rich ^uffs, ornaments
and silken fabrics hanging in their shops for several
days. The mosque of ‘Amr is highly venerated and
widely celebrated. The Friday service is held in it,
and the road runs through it from ea^ to we^. The
madrasas [college mosques] of Cairo cannot be counted
for multitude. As for the Mari^an [hospital], which

cables ” near the mausoleum
of Sultan ^ala*dn, no description is adequate to its

beauties. It contains an innumerable quantity of
appliances and medicaments, and its daily revenue is
put as high as a thousand dinars.

There arc a large number of religious establishments
[** convents ”], which they call khtUsqiths^ and the
nobles vie with one another in building them. Each
of these is set apart for a separate school of danv/shes,
moilly Persians, who arc men of good education and
adepts in the myAical doflrincs. Each has a superior
and a doorkeeper and their affairs arc admirably or-
ganized. They have many special cuAoms, one of
which has to do with their food. The steward of
the house comes in the morning to the danvfshcs,
each of whom indicates what food he desires, and when
they assemble for meals, each person is given his
bread and soup in a separate dish, none sharing with
another. They cat twice a day. They arc each given
winter clothes and summer clothes, and a monthly
allowance of from t^venty to thirty dirhams. Every
Thursday night they receive sugar cakes, soap to
wash their clothes, the price of a bath, and oil for their
lamps. These men arc celibate; the married men have
separate convents.

At Cairo too is the great cemetery of al-Qardfa,
which is a place of peculiar sanflity, and contains the
graves of innumerable scholars and pious believers.
In the Qardfa the people build beautiful pavilions
surrounded by walls, so that they look like houses.^
They also build chambers and hire Koran-readers,
who recite night and day in agreeable voices. Some
of them build religious houses and madrasas beside
the mausoleums and on Thursday nights they go out
to spend the night there with their children and women-
folk, and make a circuit of the famous tombs. They
go out to spend the night there also on the “ Night
of mid-Sha‘bdn,” and the market-people take out all
kinds of eatables.^^ Among the many celebrated

sanftuaries [in the city] is the holy shrine where there
reposes the head of al-Husayn.^“ Beside it is a va^t
monaftery of ^riking con^ruftion, on the doors of
which there are silver rings and plates of the same
metal.

The Egyptian Nile^^ surpasses all rivers of the earth
in sweetness of ta^e, length of course, and utility.
No other river in the world can show such a con-
tinuous series of towns and villages along its banks,
or a basin so intensely cultivated. Its course is from
south to north, contrary to all the other [great] rivers.
One extraordinary thing about it is that it begins to
rise in the extreme hot weather, at the time when
rivers generally diminish and dry up, and begins to
subside ju^ when rivers begin to increase and over-
flow. The river Indus resembles it in this feature.
The Nile is one of the five, great rivers of the world,
which are the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Syr Darya and
Amu Darya; five other rivers resemble these, the Indus,
which is called Pan] Ab [t.e. Five Rivers], the river
of India which is called Gang [Ganges] — it is to it
that the Hindus go on pilgrimage, and when they
burn their dead they throw the ashes into it, and they
say that it comes from Paradise — the river Jiin [Jumna,
or perhaps Brahmaputra] in India, the river Itil
[Tolga] in the Qipchaq steppes, on the banks of which
is the city of Sara, and the river Sard [Hoang-Ho]
in the land of Cathay. All these will be mentioned
in their proper places, if God will. Some di^ance
below Cairo the Nile divides into three ^reams,^^
none of which can be crossed except by boat, winter
or summer. The inhabitants of every township have
canals led off the Nile ; these are filled when the river
is in flood and carry the water over the fields.

From Cairo I travelled into Upper Egypt, with the
intention of crossing to the Hijaz. On the fir^ night
I stayed at the monastery of Dayr at-Ti'n, which was

52



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

built to house certain illustrious relics — a fragment of
the Prophet’s wooden basin and the pencil with which
he used to apply kohl, the awl he used for sewing his
sandals, and the Koran belonging to the Caliph ‘All
written in his own hand. These were bought, it is
said, for a hundred thousand dirhams by the builder
of the monastery, who also established funds to supply
food to all comers and to maintain the guardians of
the sacred relics. Thence my way lay through a
number of towns and villages to Munyat Ibn Khaslb
[Minia], a large town which is built on the bank of
the Nile, and moSt emphatically excels all the other
towns of Upper Egypt. I went on through Man-
faldt, Asyiit, Ikhmim, where there is a with

sculptures and inscriptions which no one can now
read — another of these herbas there was pulled down
and its Slones used to build a madrasa — QinS, Qils,
where the governor of Upper Egypt resides, Luxor,
■a pretty litde town containing the tomb of the pious
ascetic Abu’l-HajjSj,“ Esnd, and thence a day and a
night’s journey through desert country to Edfd. Here
we crossed the Nile and, hiring camels, journeyed
with a party of Arabs through a desert, totally devoid
of settlements but quite safe for travelling. One of
our halts was at Humaythira, a place infefted with
hyenas. All night long we kept driving them away,
and indeed one got at my baggage, tore open one of
the sacks, pulled out a bag of dates, and made off
with it. We found the bag next morning, torn to
pieces and with most of the contents eaten.

After fifteen days’ travelling we reached the town
of Aydhdb,^ a large town, well supplied with milk
and fish; dates and grain are imported from Upper
Egypt. Its inhabitants are Bejds. These people
are black-skinned; they wrap themselves in yellow
blankets and tie headbands about a fingerbreadth
wide round their heads. They do not give their
53



SELECTIONS FROM THE

daughters any share in their inheritance. They live
on camels’ milk and they ride on Meharis [drome-
daries]. One-third of the city belongs to the Sultan
of Egypt and two-thirds to the King of the Bejas,
who is called al-Hudrubi.^® On reaching Aydhab
we found that al-Hudrubi was engaged in warfare with
the Turks [i.e. the troops of the Sultan of Egypt],
that he had sunk the ships and that the Turks had
fled before him. It was impossible for us to attempt
the sea-crossing, so we sold the provisions that we
had made ready for it, and returned to Qds with the
Arabs from whom we had hired the camels. We
sailed thence down the Nile (it was at the flood time)
and after an eight days’ journey reached Cairo, where
I ^ayed only one night, and immediately set out for
Syria. This was in the middle of July, 1326.

My route lay through Bilbays and as-Salihiya, after
which we entered the sands and halted at a number
of stations. At each of these there was a hostelry,
which they call a khdn^^ where travellers alight with
their bea^s. Each khan has a water wheel supplying
a fountain and a shop at which the traveller buys what
he requires for himself and his bea^. At the Nation
of Qatya®° cu^oms-dues are colledled from the mer-
chants, and their goods and baggage are thoroughly
examined and searched. There are offices here, with
officers, clerks, and notaries, and the daily revenue is
a thousand gold dinars. No one is allowed to pass
into Syria without a passport from Egypt, nor into
Egypt without a passport from Syria, for the pro-
teftion of the property of the subjefts and as a measure
of precaution again^ spies from ‘Iraq. The responsi-
bility of guarding this road has been entru^ed to the
Badawin. At nightfall they smooth down the sand
so that no track is left on it, then in the morning the
governor comes and looks at the sand. If he finds
any track on it he commands the Arabs to bring the

54



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

person who made it, and they set out in pursuit and
never fail to catch him. He is then brought to the
governor, who pui^ishes him as he sees fit. The
governor at the time of my passage treated me as
a.gue^l and showed me great kindness, and allowed
all those who were with me to pass. From here we
went on to Gaza, which is the fir^l city of Syria on the
side next the Egyptian frontier.

From Gaza I travelled to the city of Abraham
[Hebron], the mosque of which is of elegant, but
sub^antial, conRru<^ion, imposing and lofty, and
built of squared Aoncs. At one angle of it there is
a ilone, one of whose -faces measures twenty-seven
spans. It is said that Solomon commanded the jinn^^
to build it. Inside it is the sacred cave containing
the graves of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, opposite
which arc three graves, which are those of their wives.
I queRioned the imdm, a man of great pietv and learn-
ing, on the authenticity of these graves, and he replied:
“ All the scholars whom I have met hold these graves
to be the very graves of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and
their wives. No one queilions this except introducers
of false doflrines; it is a tradition which has passed
from father to son for generations and admits of no
doubt.” This mosque contains also the grave of
Joseph, and somewhat to the ea^l of it lies the tomb
of Lot,®^ which is surmounted by an elegant building.
In the neighbourhood is Lot’s lake [the Dead Sea],
which is brackish and is said to cover the site of
the settlements of Lot’s people. On the way from
Hebron to Jerusalem, I visited Bethlehem, the birth-
place of Jesus. The site is covered by a large build-
ing; the Chri^lians regard it with intense veneration
and hospitably entertain all who alight at it.

We then reached Jerusalem (may God ennoble
her 1), third in excellence after the two holy shrines
of Mecca and Madina, and the place whence the
SS



SELECTIONS FROM THE

Prophet was caught up into heaven.^® Its walls were
deftroyed by the illu^rious King Saladin and his
successors, for fear le^t the Chri^ians should seize
it and fortify themselves in it. The sacred mosque
is a mo^ beautiful building, and is said to be the larged
mosque in the world. Its length from ea 4 l to welt is
put at 752, “royal” cubits®^ and its breadth at 435.
On three sides it has many entrances, but on the
south side I know of one only, which is that by which
the imam enters. The entire mosque is an open
court and unroofed, except the mosque al-Aqsa, which
has a roof of mo^t excellent workmanship, embellished
with gold and brilliant colours. Some other parts
of the mosque are roofed as well. The Dome of the
Rock is a building of extraordinary beauty, solidity,
elegance, and singularity of shape. It ^ands on an
elevation in the centre of the mosque and is reached
by a flight of marble ^eps. It has four doors. The
space round it is also paved with marble, excellently
done, and the interior likewise. Both outside and
inside the decoration is so magnificent and the work-
manship so surpassing as to defy description. The
greater part is covered with gold so that the eyes of
one who gazes on its beauties are dazzled by its bril-
liance, now glowing like a mass of light, now flashing
like lightning. In the centre of the Dome is the
blessed rock from which the Prophet ascended to
heaven, a great rock projefting about a man’s height,
and underneath it there is a cave the size of a small
room, also of a man’s height, with ^eps leading down
to it. Encircling the rock are two railings of excellent
workmanship, the one nearer the rock being artistically
con^ruded in iron,=® and the other of wood.

Among the grace-be^oWing sanSfuaries of Jeru-
salem is a building, situated on the farther side of the
valley called the valley of Jahannam [Gehenna] to
the ea^l of the town, on a high hill. This building is

56



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

said to mark the place whence Jesus ascended to
hcaven.^^ In the bottom of the same valley is a
church venerated by the Chriilians, who say that it
contains the grave of Mary. In the same place there
is another church which the Chriilians venerate and
to which they come on pilgrimage. This is the
church of which they are fusely persuaded to believe
that it contains the grave of Jesus. All who come on
pilgrimage to visit it pay a stipulated tax to the
Muslims, and suffer very unwillingly various humilia-
tions. Thereabouts also is the place of the cradle
of Jesus, “ which is visited in order to obtain blessing.

I journeyed thereafter from Jerusalem to the fortress
of Askalon, which is a total ruin. Of the great mosque,
known as the mosque of ‘Omar, nothing remains but
its walls and some marble columns of matchless
beautjr, partly landing and partly fallen. Amongst
them is a wonderful red column, of which the people
tell that the ChriAians carried it off to their country
but afterwards loft it, when it was found in its place
at Askalon. Thence I went on to the city of ar-Ram-
lah, which is also called Filaftfn [Paleftine], in the
qibla of those mosque they say three hundred of the
prophets are buried. From ar-Ramlah I went to the
town of Nibulus ([Shechemj, a city with an abundance
of trees and perennial ftreams, and one of the richeft
in Syria for olives, the oil of which is exported thence
to Cairo and Damascus. It is at Nibulus that the
carob-sweet is manufafturedand exported to Damascus
and elsewhere. It is made in this way; the carobs
are cooked and then pressed, the juice that runs out
is gathered and the sweet is manufaftured from it.
The juice itself too is exported to Cairo and Damascus.
Nibulus has also a species of melon which is called
by its name, a good and delicious fruit. Thence I
went to Ajaliin®® making in the direftion of Lddhiqiya,
and passing through the Ghawr, followed the coaft to
57



SELECTIONS FROM THE

*Akka [Acre], which is in ruins. Acre was formerly
the capital and port of the country of the Franks in
Syria, and rivalled Con^antinople itself.

I went on from here to Sur [Tyre], which is a ruin,
though there is outside it an inhabited village, mo^f
of whose population belong to the se6t called
“ Refusers.” It is this city of Tyre which has become
proverbial for impregnability, because the sea sur-
rounds it on three sides and it has two gates, one on
the landward side and one to the sea. That on the
landward side is protected by four outer walls each
with brea^works, while the sea gate Elands between
two great towers. There is no more marvellous or
more remarkable piece of masonry in the world than
this, for the sea surrounds it on three sides and on
the fourth there is a wall under which the ships pass
and come to anchor. In former times an iron chain
was stretched between the two towers to form a barrier,
so that there was no way in or out until it was lowered.
It was placed under the charge of guards and tru^-
worthy agents, and none might enter or leave without
their knowledge. Acre also had a harbour resembling
it, but it admitted only small ships. From Tyre I
went on to Sayda [Sidon], a pleasant town on the
coaft, and rich in fruit; it exports figs, raisins, and olive
oil to Cairo.

Next I went on to the town of Tabariya [Tiberias].^®
It was formerly a large and important city, of which
nothing now remains but veftiges witnessing to its
former greatness. It possesses wonderful baths with
separate eftablishments for men and women, the water
of which is very hot. At Tiberias is the famous lake
[the Sea of Galilee], about eighteen miles long and
more than nine in breadth. The town has a mosque >
known as the “ Mosque of the Prophets,” containing
the graves of Shu‘ayb [Jethro] and his daughter, the
wife of Moses, as well as those of Solomon, Judah,

58



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

and Reuben. From Tiberias we went to visit the
well into which Joseph was a large and deep well,
in the courtyard of a small mosque, and drank some
water from it. It was rain water, but the guardian
told us that there is a spring in it as well. We went
on from there to Baynit, a small town with fine markets
and a beautiful mosque. Fruit and iron are exported
from it to Egypt.

We set out from here to visit the tomb of Abu
Ya'qdb Yiisuf, who, they say, was a king in North-
weA Africa. The tomb is at a place called Karak
Nuh,'^’ and beside it is a religious house at which all
travellers arc entertained. Some say that it was the
Sultan Saladin who endowed it, others that it was the
Sultan Ndr ad-Din. The Aory goes that Abu Ya‘qiib,
after laying some time at Damascus with the Sultan,
who had been warned in a dream that Abii Ya'qdb
would bring him some advantage, left the town in
solitary Bight during a season of great coldness, and
came to a village in its neighbourhood. In this village
there was a man of humble Elation who invited him
to ilay in his house, and on his consenting, made him
soup and killed a chicken and brought it to him with
barley bread. After his meal Ab\i Ya'qiib prayed
for a blessing on his ho51. Now this man had several
children, one of them being a girl who was shortly
to be conduced to her husband. It is a custom in
that country that a girl's father gives her an outfit,
the greater part of which consists in copper utensils.
These are regarded by them with great pride and are
made the subject of special stipulations in the marriage
contraft. Abd Ya’qiib therefore said to the man,
“ Have you any copper utensils ?” “Yes ” he replied,
“ I have juft bought some for my daughter’s outfit.”
Abii Ya‘qdb told him to bring them and when he had
brought them said “Now borrow all that you can
from your neighbours.” So he did so and laid them
59



SELECTIONS FROM THE

all before him. He then lit fires round them, and
taking out a purse which he had containing an elixir,
threw some of it over the brass, and the whole array
was changed into gold. Leaving these in a locked
chamber, Abd Ya'qiib wrote to Nur ad-Din at
Damascus, telling him about them, and exhorting him
to build and endow a hospital for sick strangers and
to con^ruft religious houses on the highways. He
bade him also satisfy the owners of the copper vessels
and provide for the maintenance of the owner of the
house. The latter took the letter to the king, who
came to the village and removed the gold, after satis-
fying the owners of the vessels and the man himself.
He searched for Abii Ya‘qtib, but failing to find any
trace or news of him, returned to Damascus, where he
built the hospital which is known by his name and is
the fine^ in the world.

I came next to the city of Atrabulus [Tripoli], one
of the principal towns in Syria. It lies two miles
inland, and has only recently been built. The old
town was right on the shore; the Chri^ians held it for
a time, and when it was recovered by Sultan Baybars^
it was pulled down and this new town built. There
are some fine bath-houses in it, one of which is called
after Sindamiir, who was a former governor of the
city. Many stories are told of his severity to evil-
doers. Here is one of them. A woman complained
to him that one of the mamlfiks of his personal ^aff
had seized some milk that she was selling and had
drunk it. She had no evidence, but Sindamfir sent
for the inan. He was cut in two, and the milk came
out of his entrails. Similar Tories are told of al-
Atris at the time when he was governor, of Aydhab
under Sultan Qala’fin, and of Kebek, the Sultan of
Turkestan

From Tripoli I went by way of Hisn al-Akrad
[^Krak des Chevaliers^ now Qal'at al-Hisnl and Hims

to Hamdh, another of the metropolitan cities of Syria.
It is surrounded by orchards and gardens, in the
middt of which there are waterwheels like revolving
globes. Thence to Ma'arra, which lies in a di^lrift
inhabited by some sort of ShiMtes, abominable people
who hate the Ten Companions and every person
whose name is ‘Ornar.*^ We went on from there to
Sarmfn, where brick soap is manufafhired and ex*
ported to Cairo and Damascus. Besides this they
manufafhire perfumed soap, for washing hands, and
colour it red and yellow. These people too arc rc-
vilers, who hate the Ten, and — an extraordinary thing
— never mention the word ten. When their brokers
are selling by auflion in the markets and come to ten,
they say “ nine and one.” One day a Turk happened
to be there, and hearing a broker call “ nine and one,”
he laid his club about his head saying ” Say ‘ ten,’ ”
whereupon quoth he “Ten with the club.” We
journeyed thence to Halab [Aleppo],^ which is the
seat of the Malik al^Umardy who is the principal
commander under the sultan of Egypt. He is a
jurist and has a reputation for fair-dealing, but he is
ftingy.

I went on from there to Antdkiya [Antioch], by
way of Tizfn, a new town founded by the Turkmens.^
Antioch was protcflcd formerly by a wall of unrivalled
solidity among the cities of Syria, but al-Malik az-
Zdhir [Baybars] pulled it down when he captured the
town.^’ It is very densely populated and possesses
beautiful buildings, with abundant trees and water.
Thence I visited the fortress of Baghrds,^ at the en-
trance to the land of Sfs [Little Armenia], that is, the
land of the Armenian infidels, and many other carries
and fortresses, several of which belong to a se6t called
Isma'ilites or Fiddwfs^ and may be entered by none
but members of the se<SI. They are the arrows of the
sultan ; by means of them he dlrikes those of his enemies



SELECTIONS FROM THE

who escape into ‘Iraq and other lands. They receive
fixed salaries, and when the sultan desires to send one
of them to assassinate one of his enemies, he pays
him his blood-money. If after carrying out his
allotted task he escapes with his life, the money is
his, but if he is killed it goes to his sons. They carry
poisoned daggers, with which they strike their viftim,
but sometimes their plans miscarry and they themselves
are killed.

From the cables of the Fidawis I went on. to the
town of Jabala, which lies on the coa^l, about a mile
inland. It contains the grave of the famous saint
Ibrahim ibn Adham, he who renounced a kingdom
and consecrated himself to God.^° All visitors to this
grave give a candle to the keeper, with the result that
many hundredweights of them are collefted. . The
majority of the people of this coastal di^lridl belong
to the sed of the Nusayris, who believe that ‘AH®^ is
a God. They do not pray, nor do they purify them-
selves, nor fa^. Al-Malik az-Zahir [Baybars] com-
pelled them to build mosques in their villages, so in
every village they put up a mosque far away from
their houses, and they neither enter them nor keep
them in repair. Often they are used for refuges for
their catde and asses. Often too a ftranger comes
to their country and he ftops at the mosque and recites
the call to prayer and then they call out “ Stop braying;
your fodder is coming to you.” There are a great
many of these people.

They tell a ftory that an unknown person arrived
in the country of this seft and gave himself out as the
Mahdi. They flocked round him, and he promised
them the possession of the land and divided Syria up
between them. He used to nominate them each to
a town and tell them to go there, giving them olive-
leaves and saying “ Take these as tokens of success,
for they are as warrants of your appointment.” When



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

any one of them came to a town, the governor sent
for him, and the man would say “ The Imdm al-Mahdi
has given me this town.” The governor would reply
“ Where is your warrant ?” and he would produce the
olive-leaves, and be punished and put in prison.
Later on he ordered them to make ready to fight with
the Muslims and to begin with the town of Jabala.
He told them to take myrtle rods instead of swords
and promised them that these would become swords
in their hands at the moment of the battle. They made
a surprise attack on Jabala while the inhabitants were
attending a Friday service in the mosque, and entered
the houses and dishonoured the women. The Muslims
came rushing out of their mosque, seized weapons, and
killed them as they pleased. When the news was
brought to Lddhiqi'ya the governor moved out with
his troops, and the news having been sent by carrier-
pigeons to Tripoli, the chief commandant joined him
with his troops. The Nusayris were pursued until
about twenty thousand of them had been killed. The
remainder fortified themselves in the hills and sent a
message to the chief commandant, undertaking to
pay him one dinar per head if he would spare them.
The news' had been sent by pigeons to the Sultan,
who replied ordering them to be put to the sword.
The chief commandant, however, represented to him
that these people were tillers of the soil for the Muslims
and that if they were killed the Muslims would suffer
in consequence, so their lives were spared.

I went next to the towa of Ladhiqiya [Latakia],
In the outskirts is a Chri^ian monastery known as
Dayr al-Fdriis, which is the larged mona^ery in Syria
and Egypt. It is inhabited by monks, and Christians
visit it from all quarters. All who Stop there, Muslims
or Christians, are entertained; their food is bread,
cheese, olives, vinegar and capers. The harbour of
Ladhiqfya is protefted by a chain between two towers,



SELECTIONS FROM THE

so that no ship can either enter or leave it until the
chain is lowered for it. It is one of the be^ harbours
in Syria. From there I went to the fortress of al-
Marqab [Belvedere], a great fortress resembling
Karak. It is built on a high hill and outside it is
a suburb where Grangers ^op. They are not allowed
to enter the cattle. It was captured from the Chri^ians
by al-Malik al-Mansdr Qala’iin, and close by it was
born his son al-Malik an-Nasir [the reigning sultan
of Egypt]. Thence I went to the mountain of
al-Aqra‘, which is the highest mountain in Syria, and
the fir^ part of the country visible from the sea. The
inhabitants of this mountain-range are Turkmens, and
it contains springs and running breams. I went on
from there to the mountains of Lubnan [Lebanon].
These are among the moil fertile mountains on earth,
with all sorts of fruits and springs of water and shady
coverts. There are always large numbers of devotees
and ascetics to be found in these mountains (the place is
noted for this) and I saw a company of anchorites there.

We came next to the town of Ba‘albek, an old town
and one of the fineil in Syria, rivalling Damascus in
its innumerable amenities. No other diilridl has such
an abundance of cherries, and many kinds of sweet-
meats are manufadured in it, as well as textiles, and
wooden vessels and spoons that cannot be equalled
elsewhere. They make a series of plates one within
the other to as many as ten in all, yet anyone looking
at it would take them to be one plate. They do the
same with spoons, and put them in a leather case.
A man can carry this in his belt, and on joining in
a meal with his friends take out what looks like one
spoon and distribute nine others from within it.
Ba albek is one day’s journey from Damascus by hard
going; caravans on leaving Ba‘ albek spend a night at a
small village called az-Zabdani and go on to Damascus
the following morning. I reached Ba'albek in the

64



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

evening and left it next morning because of my eager-
ness to get to Damascus.

I entered Damascus on Thursday 9th Ramaddn 726
[9th Augu^, 1326], and lodged at the Mdlikitc
college called ash-Shardbishfya. Damascus surpasses
all other cities in beauty, and no description, how-
ever full, can do ju^ice to its charms. Nothing,
however, can better the words of Ibn Jubayr in
describing it.®* The Cathedral Mosque, known as the
Umayyad Mosque, is the moff magnificent mosque
in the world, the finest in conilruftion and noblest in
beauty, grace and pcrfeflion; it is matchless and un-
equal!^. The person who undertook its con^lruc-
tion was the Caliph Walld I. [705-71^]. He applied
to the Roman Emperor at Constantinople ordering
him to send craftsmen to him, and the Emperor sent
him twelve thousand of them. The site of the mosque
was a church, and when the Muslims captured
Damascus, one of their commanders entered from one
side by the sword and reached as far as the middle of
the church, while the other entered peaceably from
the eaAern side and reached the middle also. So the
Muslims made the half of the church which they had
entered by force into a mosque and the half which
they had entered by peaceful agreement remained as
a church. When Walld decided to extend the mosque
over the entire church he asked the Greeks to sell him
their church for whatsoever equivalent they desired,
but they refused, so he seized it. The Chriftians used
to say that whoever dcilroyed the church would be
ftricken with madness and they told that to Walld.
But he replied “ I shall be the fir^t to be stricken
by madness in the service of God,” and seizing an
axe, he set to work to knock it down with his own
hands. The Muslims on seeing that followed his
example, and God proved false the assertion of the
Chriftians,“

This mosque has four doors. The southern door,
called the “Door of Increase,” is approached by a
spacious passage where the dealers in second-hand
goods and other commodities have their shops.
Through it lies the way to the [former] Cavalry
House, and on the left as one emerges from it is the
coppersmiths’ gallery, a large bazaar, one of the fine^
in Damascus, extending along the south wall of the
mosque. This bazaar occupies the site of the palace
of the Caliph Mu‘awiya I.,®^ which was called al-
Khadra [The Green Palace]; the ‘Abbasids pulled it
down and a bazaar took its place. The ea^ern door,
called the Jayriin door, is the larged of the doors of
the mosque. It also has a large passage, leading out
to a large and extensive colonnade which is entered
through a quintuple gateway between six tall columns.
Along both sides of this passage are pillars, supporting
circular galleries, where the doth merchants among^
others have their shops; above these again are long
galleries in which are the shops of the jewellers and
booksellers and makers of admirable glass-ware. In
the square adjoining the fir^ door are the ^alls of
the principal notaries, in each of which there may be
five or six witnesses in attendance and a person
authorized by the qadi to perform marriage-ceremonies.
The other notaries are scattered throughout the city.
Near these ^alls is the bazaar of the ftationers, who
sell paper, pens, and ink. In the middle of the passage
there is a large round marble basin, surrounded by
a pavilion supported on marble columns but lacking
a roof. In the centre of the basin is a copper pipe
which forces out water under pressure so that it rises
into the air more than a man’s height. They call it
‘‘The Waterspout,” and it is a fine sight. To the
right as one comes out of the Jayriin door, which is
called also the “ Door of the Hours,” is an upper
gallery shaped like a large arch, within which there

66



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

are small open arches furnished with doors, to the
number of the hours of the day. These doors are
painted green on the inside and yellow on the outside,
and as each hour of the day passes the green inner
side of the door is turned to the outside, and vice

person in the room who is responsible for turning
them by hand as the hours pass.** The wc^ern door
is called the “ Door of the Foil the passage outside
it contains the shops of the candlemakers and a gallery
for the sale of fruit. The northern door is called the
“Door of the Ginfeftioncrs it too has a large
passageway, and on the right as one leaves it is a
Khdnadh^ which has a large basin of water in the centre
and lavatories supplied with running water. At each
of the four doors of the mosque is a building for
ritual ablutions, containing about a hundred rooms
abundantly supplied with running water.

One of the principal Hanbalite doctors at Damascus
was Taqi ad^Din Ibn Taymiya, a man of great ability
and wide learning, but with some kink in his brain.
The people of Damascus idolized him. He used to
preach to them from the pulpit, and one day he made
some statement that the other theologians disap-
proved; they carried the case to the sultan and m
consequence Ibn Taymiya was imprisoned for some
years. While he was m prison he wrote a com-
mentary on the Koran, which he called “ The Ocean,”
in about forty volumes. Later on his mother pre-
sented herself before the sultan and interceded for
him, so he was set at liberty, until he did the same
thing again. I was in Damascus at the time and
attended the service which he was conducing one
Friday, as he was addressing and admonishing the
people from the pulpit. In the mid^ of his discourse
he said “Verily God descends to the sky over our
world [from Heaven] in the same bodily fashion that



SELECTIONS FROM THE

I make this descent,” and stepped down one ^ep of
the pulpit. A Malikite dodlor present contradifled
him and objedled to his ^atement,®® but the common
people rose up again^ this dodlor, and beat him with
their hands and their shoes so severely that his turban
fell off and disclosed a silken skull-cap on his head.
Inveighing against him for wearing this,®'^ they haled
him before the qadi of the Hanbalites, who ordered
him to be imprisoned and afterwards had him beaten.
The other dodlors objedled to this treatment and carried
the matter before the principal amir, who wrote to the
sultan about the matter and at the same time drew
up a legal attestation againSt Ibn Taymiya for various
heretical pronouncements. This deed was sent on
to the sultan, who gave orders that Ibn Taymiya
should be imprisoned in the citadel, and there he
remained until his death.®®

One of the celebrated sanSbiaries at Damascus is
the Mosque of the Footprints (al-Aqdam), which lies
two miles south of the city, alongside the main high-
way which leads to the Hijdz, Jerusalem, and Egypt.
It is a large mosque, very blessed, richly endowed,
and very highly venerated by the Damascenes. The
footprints from which it derives its name are certain
footprints impressed upon a rock there, which are
said to be the mark of Moses’ foot. In this mosque
there is a small chamber containing a ^lone with the
following inscription “A certain pious man saw in
his sleep the Chosen One [Muhammad], who said to
him ‘ Here is the grave of my brother Moses.’ ” I
saw a remarkable instance of the veneration in which
the Damascenes hold this mosque during the great
pe^ilence, on my return journey through Damascus
^the latter part of July 1348. The viceroy Arghdn
Shah ordered a crier to proclaim through Damascus
that all the people should fa^ for three days and that
no one should cook anything eatable in the market

during the daytime.*® For mo^ of the people there
cat no food but what has been prepared in the market,®®
So the people failed for three successive days, the lail
of which was a Thursday, then they assembled in the
Great Mosque, amirs, sharifs, qddis, theologians, and
all the other classes of the people, until the place was
filled to overflowing, and there they spent the Thursday
night in prayers and litanies. After the dawn prayer
next morning they all went out together on foot, holding
Korans in their hands, and £e amirs barefooted.
The procession was joined by the entire population
of the town, men and women, small and large; the
Jews came with their Book of the Law and the Chris-
tians with their Gospel, all of them with their women
and children. The whole concourse, weeping and
supplicating and seeking the favour of God through
His Books and His Prophets, made their way to ^e
Mosque of the Footprints, and there they remained
in supplication and invocation until near midday.
They then returned to the city and held the Friday
service, and God lightened their aflliflion; for the
number of deaths in a single day at Damascus did
not attain two thousand, while in Cairo and Old Cairo
it reached the figure of twenty-four thousand a day.

The variety and expenditure of the religious endow-
ments at Damascus are beyond computation. There
are endowments in aid of persons who cannot under-
take the pilgrimage to Mecca, out of which are paid
the expenses of those who go in their flead. There
are other endowments for supplying wedding outfits
to girls whose families are unable to provide them,
and others for the freeing of prisoners. There
are endowments for travellers, out* of the revenues
of which they are given food, clothing, and the ex-
penses of conveyance to their countries. Then there
are endowments for the improvement and paving of
the Greets, because all the lanes in Damascus have
69



SELECTIONS FROM THE

pavements on either side, on which the foot passengers
walk, while those who ride use the roadway in the
centre. Besides these there are endowments for other
charitable purposes. One day as I went along a lane
in Damascus I saw a small slave who had dropped
a Chinese porcelain dish, which was broken to bits.
A number of people colleifled round him and one of
them said to him, “ Gather up the pieces and take
them to the cu^odian of the endowments for utensils.”
He did so, and the man went with him to the cu^odian,
where the slave showed the broken pieces and received
a sum sufficient to buy a similar dish. This is an
excellent inilitution, for the ma^er of the slave would
undoubtedly have beaten him, or at lea^ scolded him,
for breaking the dish, and the slave would have been
heartbroken and upset at the accident. This bene-
fadlion is indeed a mender of hearts — may God richly
reward him whose zeal for good works rose to such
heights !

The people of Damascus vie with one another in
building mosques, religious houses, colleges and
mausoleums. They have a high opinion of the North
Africans, and freely entru^ them with the care of
their moneys, wives, and children. All strangers
among^ them are handsomely treated, and care is
taken that they are not forced to any adlion that might
injure their self-respeft. When I came to Damascus
a firm friendship sprang up between the Malikite
professor Niir ad-Din Sakhawi and me, and he besought
me to breakfa^ at his house^ during the nights of
Ramadan. After I had visited him for four nights
I had a stroke of fever and absented myself. He sent
in search of me, and although I pleaded my illness in
excuse he refused to accept it. I went back to his
house and spent the night there, and when I desired
to take my leave the next morning he would not hear
of it, but said to me “ Consider my house as your

70



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

own or as your father’s or brother’s.” He then had
a doctor sent for, and gave orders that all the medicines
and dishes that the do^or prescribed were to be made
for me in his house, i itayed thus with him until
the Fail-breaking, when 1 went to the feikival prayers
and God healed me of what had befallen me. Mean-
while all the money I had for my expenses was ex-
hauiled. Ndr ad-Dfn, learning this, hired camels
for me and ^avc me travelling and other provisions,
and money in addition, saying “ It will come in for
any serious matter that may land you in difHculties

The Damascenes observe an admirable order in
funeral processions. Th(w walk in front of the bier,
while reciters intone the Koran in beautiful and aife^-
ing voices, and pray over it In the Cathedral mosque,
when the reading is completed the muezzins rise and
say ” Reflcfl on your prayer for so-and-so, the pious
and learned,” describing him with good epithets, and
having prayed over him they take nim to his grave.
The Indians have a funcr^ ceremony even more
admirable than this. On the morning of the third
day after the burial they assemble m the burial-
place of the deceased, which is spread with fine cloths,
the grave being covered with magnificent hangings
and surrounded by sweet-scented flowers, roses, eglan-
tine, andjasmine, for these flowers arc perennial with
them. They bring lemon and citrus trees as well,
tying on their fruits if they have none, anc^ut up an
awning to shade the mourning party. The qddfs,
amirs and other persons of rank come and take their
seats, and after recitation of the Koran, the qddi rises
and delivers a set oration, speaking of the deceased,
and mourning his death in an elegiac ode, then com-
forting his relatives, and praying for the sultan. When
the sultan's name is mentioned the audience rise and
bow their heads towards the quarter in which the

71



SELECTIONS FROM THE

sultan is. The qadi then resumes his seat, and rose-
water is brought in and sprinkled on all the people,
beginning with the qadi. After this syrup is brought
in and served to everyone, beginning with the qddi.
Finally the betel is brought. This they hold in high
esteem, and give to their gue^s as a mark of respeft;
a gift of betel from the sultan is a greater honour than
a gift of money or robes of honour. When a man dies
his family eat no betel until the day of this ceremony,
when the qadi takes some leaves of it and gives them
to the heir of the deceased, who eats them, after which
the party disperses.

When the new moon of the month Shawwal appeared
in the same year [ist September 1326], the Hijdz
caravan left Damascus and I set off along with it.®^
At Bosra the caravans usually halt for four days so
that any who have been detained at Damascus by
business affairs may make up on them. Thence they
go to the Pool of Ziza, where they ^op for a day,
and then through al-Lajjdn to the Ca^le of Karak.
Karak, which is also called “ The Ca^le of the Raven,”
is. one of the mo^ marvellous, impregnable, and cele-
brated of fortresses. It is surrounded on all sides
by the river-bed, and has but one gate, the entrance
to which is hewn in the living rock, as also is the
approach to its vestibule. This fortress is used by
kings as a place of refuge in times of calamity, as the
sultan an-Nasir did when his mamMk Saldr seized
the supreme authority. The caravan topped for
four days at a place called ath-Thanfya outside
Karak, where preparations were made for entering
the desert. Thence we journeyed to Ma'an, which
is the la^ town in Syria, and from ‘Aqabat as-Sawdn
entered the desert, of which the saying goes : “ He
who enters it is lo^t, and he who leaves it is born.”
After a march of two days we halted at Dhat Hajj,
where there are subterranean waterbeds but no habita-

72



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

tions, and then went on to W4d{ Boldah (in which
there is no watcr)“ and to Tablik, which is the place
to which the Prophet led an expedition. The Syrian
pilgrims have a cuSiom that, on reaching the camp at
Tabiik, they take their weapons, unsheathe their
swords, and charge upon the caj^, ^riking the palms
with their swords and saying ** Thus did the Prophet
of God enter it.” The great caravan halts at Tab\ik
for four days to re^ and to water the camels and lay
in water for the terrible desert bct>vcen Tabiik and
al-‘Uld. The cuAom of the water-carriers is to camp
beside the spring, and they have tanks made of buffalo
hides, like great ci^erns, from which they water the
camels and hll the waterskins. Each amir or person
of rank has a special tank for the needs of his own
camels and personnel; the other people make private
agreements with the watercarriers to water their camels
and HU their waterskins for a fixed sum of money.

From Tabiik the caravan travels with great speed
night and day, for fear of this desert. Halfway
through is the valley of al-Ukhaydir, which might
well be the valley of Hell (may God preserve us from
it).“ One year the pilgrims suffered terribly here
from the samoom-wind; the water-supplies dried up
and the price of a single drink rose to a thousand
dinars, but both seller and buyer perished. Their
^lory is written on a rock in the valley. Five days
after leaving Tabdk they reach the well of al-Hijr,
which has an abundance of water, but not a soul
draws water there, however violent his thirst, following
the example of the Prophet, who passed it on his
expedition to Tabdk and drove on his camel, giving
orders that none should drink of its waters. Here,
in some hills of red rock, are the dwellings of Thamiid.
They are cut in the rock and have carved thresholds.
Anyone seeing them would take them to be of recent
con^lruftion. Their decayed bones are to be seen
73



SELECTIONS FROM THE

inside these houses.®^ Al-‘Ula, a large and pleasant
village with palm-gardens and water-springs, lies half
a day’s journey or less from al-Hijr.®® The pilgrims
halt there four days to provision themselves and wash
their clothes. They leave behind them here any
surplus of provisions they may have, taking with them
nothing but what is ^triftly necessary. The people
of the village are very tru^worthy. The Chri^ian
merchants of Syria may come as far as this and no
further, and they trade in provisions and other goods
with the pilgrims here. On the third day after leaving
al-‘Ula the caravan halts in the outskirts of the holy
city of Madina.

That same evening we entered the holy sanftuary
and reached the illu^rious mosque, halting in saluta-
tion at the Gate of Peace; then we prayed in the
illu^rious “ garden ” between the tomb of the Prophet
and the noble pulpit, and reverently touched the
fragment that remains of the palm-trunk again^ which
the Prophet ilood when he preached. Having paid
our meed of salutation to the lord of men from firil
to la^, the intercessor for sinners, the Prophet of
Mecca, Muhammad, as well as to his two companions
who share his grave, Abd Bakr and ‘Omar, we returned
to our camp, rejoicing at this great favour bestowed
upon us, praising God for our having reached the
former abodes and the magnificent sanftuaries of His
holy Prophet, and praying Him to grant that this
visit should not be our la^, and that we might be of
those whose pilgrimage is accepted. On this journey
our ^ay at Madina la^ed four days. We used to
spend every night in the illuftrious mosque, where the
people, after forming circles in the courtyard and
lighting large numbers of candles, would pass the
time either in reciting the Koran from volumes set
on re^^s in front of them, or in intoning litanies, or
in visiting the sandluaries of the holy tomb.

74



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

We then set out from Madfna towards Mecca, and
halted near the mosque of Dhu’I-Hulayfa, five miles
away. It was at this point that the Prophet assumed
the pilgrim garb ana obligations, and here too I
divefted myself of my tailored clothes, bathed, and
putting on the pilgrim's garment I prayed and dedi-
cated myself to the pilgrimage. Our fourth halt from
here was at Badr, where God aided His Prophet and
performed His promise.*® It is a village containing
a series of palm-gardens and a bubbling spring with
a ilream flowing from it. Our way lay thence through
a frightful desert called the Vale of Bazwd for three
days to the valley of Rdbigh, where the rainwater
forms pools which lie ^agnant for a long time. From
this point (which is juil before Juhfa) the pilgrims
from Egypt and Northwe^ Africa put on the pilgrim
garment. Three days after leaving Rdbigh we reached
the pool of Khulays, which lies in a plain and has
many palm-gardens. The Badawin of that neigh-
bourhood hold a market there, to which they bring
sheep, fruits, and condiments. Thence we travelled
through ‘Usfdn to the Bottom of Marr,®^ a fertile
valley with numerous palms and a spring supplying
a ^ream from which the di^lrift is irrigated. From
this valley fruit and vegetables are transported to
Mecca. ^ We set out at night from this blessed
valley, with hearts full of joy at reaching the goal of
our hopes, and in the morning arrived at the City of
Surety, Mecca (may God ennoble her 1), where we
immediately entered the holy sandtuary and began the
rites of pilgrimage.®*

The inhabitants of Mecca are di^linguished by many
excellent and noble aftivities and qualities, by their
beneficence to the humble and weak, and by their
kindness to strangers. When any of them makes a
feaft, he begins by giving food to the religious devotees
who are poor and without resources, inviting them
75



SELECTIONS FROM THE

firft with kindness and delicacy. The majority ol
these unfortunates are to be found by the public bake-
houses, and when anyone has his bread baked and takes
it away to his house, they follow him and he gives
each one of them some share of it, sending away none
disappointed. Even if he has but a single loaf, he
gives away a third or a half of it, cheerfully and without
any grudgingness. Another good habit of theirs is
this. The orphan children sit in the bazaar, each
with two baskets, one large and one small. When one
of the townspeople comes to the bazaar and buys
cereals, meat and vegetables, he hands them to one
of these boys, who puts the cereals in one basket and
the meat and vegetables in the other and takes them
to the man’s house, so that his meal may be prepared.
Meanwhile the man goes about his devotions and his
business. There is no in^ance of any of the boys
having ever abused their tru^ in this matter, and they
are given a fixed fee of a few coppers. The Meccans
are very elegant and clean in their dress, and mo^
of them wear white garments, which you always see
fresh and snowy. They use a great deal of perfume
and kohl and make free use of toothpicks of green
arak-wood. The Meccan women are extraordinarily
beautiful and very pious and modest. They too make
great use of perfumes to such a degree that they will
spend the night hungry in order to buy perfumes
with the price of their food. They visit the mosque
every Thursday night, wearing their fine^ apparel;
and the whole sanftuary is saturated with the smell
of their perfume. When one of these women goes
away the odour of the perfume clings to the place after
she has gone.

Among the personages who were living in religious
retirement at Mecca was a pious and ascetic doctor
who had a long-handing friendship with my father,
and used to hay with us when he came to our town of

76



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

Tangier. In the diydmc he taught at the Muzaf-
fariya college, but at night he retired to his dwelling
in the convent of RabC. This convent is one of the
fineil in Mecca; it has in its precindls a well of sweet
water which has no equal in Mecca, and its inhabitants
are all men of great piety. It is highly venerated by
the people of the Hijdz, who bring votive offerinfjs to
it, and the people of Td’if supply it with fruit. 1 heir
cudlom is that all those who possess a palm garden, or
orchard of vines, peaches or figs, give the alms-tithe
from its produce to this convent, and fetch it on their
own camels. It is two days* journey from Td'if to
Mecca. If any person fails to do this, his crop is
diminished and dcarth-dlricken in the following year.
One day the retainers of the governor of Mecca came
to this convent, led in the governor’s horses, and
watered them at the well mentioned above. After
the horses had been taken back to their diables, they
were seized with colic and threw themselves to the
ground, beating it with their heads and legs. On
he-aring of this the governor went in person to the
gate of the convent and after apologizing to the poor
recluses there, took one of them back with him. This
man rubbed the beadls* bellies with his hand, when
they expelled all the water that they had drunk, and
were cured. After that the retainers never presented
themselves at the convent except for good purposes.

CHAPTER II


On the 17th of November I left Mecca with the
commander of the ‘Iraq caravan, who hired for me
at his own expense the half of a camel-litter as far
as Baghdad, and took me under his protection. After
the farewell ceremony of circumambulation [of the
Ka‘ba] we moved out to the Bottom of Marr with
an innumerable ho^ of pilgrims from ‘Iraq, Khurasan,
Ears and other eastern lands, so many that the earth
surged with them like the sea and their march resembled
the movement of a high-piled cloud. Any person
who left the caravan for a moment and had no mark
to guide him to his place could not find it again
because of the multitude of people. With this
caravan there were many draught-camels for supplying
the poorer pilgrims with water, and other camels to
carry the provisions issued as alms and the medicines,
potions, and sugar required for any who fell ill. When-
ever the caravan halted food was cooked in great brass
cauldrons, and from these the needs of the poorer
pilgrims and those who had no provisions were supplied.
A number of spare camels accompanied it to carry
those who were unable to walk. All those measures
were due to the benefaClions and generosity of the
sultan [of ‘Iraq] Abfi Sa‘id. Besides this the caravan
included busy bazaars and many commodities and all
sorts of food and fruit. They used to march during
the night and light torches in front of the files of camels
and litters, so that you saw the country gleaming with
light and the darkness turned into day.

We returned through Khulays and Badr to Madina,
and were privileged to visit once more the [tomb of

78



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

the] Prophet. We stayed in Madina for six days,
and having provided ourselves there with water for
a three-nights’ journey, set out and halted on the third
night at Wddi’l-Anis, where we drew supplies of water
from underground water-beds. They dig down into
the ground for them and procure sweet running water.
On leaving Wddi’l-Ards we entered the land of Najd,
which is a level ilretch of country extending as far as
eye can see, and we inhaled its fine scented air. After
four marches we halted at a waterpoint called al-
‘Usayla, then resumed our march and halted at a
waterpoint called an-Naqira, where there are the
remains of watertanks like vadf reservoirs. Thence
we journeyed to a waterpoint known as al-Qdrdra,
which consi^s of tanks filled with rainwater. These
are some of the tanks which were con^rufted by
Zubayda, the daughter of Ja’far. Every tank, water-
basin, and well on this road between Mecca and
Baghdad is a noble monument to her memo^ — may
God give her richeA reward ! This locality is in the
centre of the di^lrift of Najd; it is spacious, with fine
healthy air, excellent soil, and a temperate climate at
all seasons of the year. We went on from aI-Q4nira
and halted at al-Hdjir, where there are watertanks
which often dry up, so that temporary wells muft be
dug in order to procure water. We journeyed on and
halted at Samira, which is a patch of low-lying country
on a plain, where there is a kind of fortified enceinte
which is inhabited. It has plenty of water in wells,
but brackish. The Badawin of that diSlrift come there
with sheep, melted butter, and milk, which they aell
to the pilgrims for pieces of coarse cotton doth. That
is the only thing they will take in exchange. We set
out again and halted at the “Hill with the Hole.”
This hill lies in a traft of desert land, and has at the
top of it a hole through which the wind whiiUes.
We went on from there to Wddi’l-Kunish, which has
79



SELECTIONS FROM THE

no water, and after a night march came in the morning
to the caftle of Fayd.^

Fayd is a large walled and fortified enceinte on a
level plain, with a suburb inhabited by Arabs, who
make a living by trading with the pilgrims. On their
journey to Mecca the pilgrims leave a portion of their
provisions here, and pick them up again on their return
journey.^ Fayd lies halfway between Mecca and
Bighddd and is twelve days’ journey from Kdfa, by
an easy road furnished with supplies of water in tanks.
The pilgrims are accustomed to enter this place
armed and in warlike array, in order to frighten the
Arabs who collect there and to cut short their greedy
designs on the caravan. We met there the two amirs
of the Arabs, Fayyadh and Hiyar, sons of the amir
Muhannd b. ‘Isa, accompanied by an innumerable
troop of Arab horsemen and foot-soldiers. They
showed great zeal for the safety of the pilgrims and their
encampments. The Arabs brought camels and sheep,
and the pilgrims bought from them what they could.

We resumed our journey through al-Ajfur, Zanid,
and other halting-places to the defile known as “ Devil’s
Pass.” We encamped below it [for the night] and
traversed it the next day. This is the only rough
and difficult dlretch on the whole road, and even it is
neither difficult nor long. Our next halt was at a
place called Wdqisa, where there is a large cadlle and
watertanks. It is inhabited by Arabs, and is the la^t
watering point on this road; from there on to Kdfa
there is no other watering place of any note except
breams deriving from the Euphrates. Many of the
people of Kdfa come out to Wdqisa to meet the
pilgrims, bringing flour, bread, dates and fruit, and
everybody exchanges greetings with- everybody else.
Our next halts were at a place called Lawza, where
there is y large tank of water; then a place called
al-Masajid [The Mosques], where there are three

8o



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTCTA

tanks; and after that at a place called Mandrat al-
qurdn [The Minaret of the Horns], which is a tower
landing in a desert locality, conspicuous for its height,
and decorated at the top with horns of gazelles, but
there arc no dwellings near it. We halted again in
a fertile valley called al-‘Udhayb, and afterwards at
al-Qddisiya, where the famous battle was fought
againdl the Persians, in which God manifcdlcd the
triumph of the Religion of Islam. There arc palm-
gardens and a watercourse from the Euphrates there,®
We went on from there and alighted in the town of
Mash-had ‘All at Najaf. It is a fine town, situated
in a wide rocky plain— one of the fincdl, mo^t populous,
and mo£l substantially built cities in ‘Irdq. It has
beautiful clean bazaars. We entered by the [outer]
Bdb al-Hadra, and found ourselves HrSf in the market
of the greengrocers, cooks, and butchers, then in the
fruit market, then the tailors* bazaar and the Qayiariya^
then the perfumers* bazaar, after which wc came to
the pnner] Bdb al-Hadra, where there is the tomb,
which they s:^ is the tomb of ‘AH.^ One goes through
the Bdb al-Hadra into a vaSt hospice, by which one
gains access to the gateway of the shrine, where there
are chamberlains, keepers of regi^ers and eunuchs.
As a visitor to the tomb approaches, one or all of them
rise to meet him according to his rank, and they halt
with him at the threshold. They then ask permission
for him to enter saying “ By your leave, O Commander
of the Faithful, this feeble creature asks permission
to enter the sublime reeling-place,” and command him
to kiss the threshold, which is of silver, as also are the
lintels. After this he enters the shrine, the floor of
which is covered with carpets of silk and other materials.
Inside it are candelabra of gold and silver, large and
small. In the centre is a square platform about a
man*s height, covered with wood completely hidden
under arti^ically carved plaques of gold fa^ened with
8i o



SELECTIONS FROM THE

silver nails. On this are three tombs, which they
declare are the graves of Adam, Noah, and ‘All.
Between the tombs are dishes of silver and gold, con-
taining rose-water, musk, and other perfumes; the
visitor dips his hand in these and anoints his face with
the perfume for a blessing. The shrine has another
doorway, also with a silver threshold and hangings,
of coloured silk, which opens into a mosque. The
inhabitants of the town are all Shi'ites, and at this
mausoleum many miracles are performed, which they
regard as substantiating its claim to be the tomb of
‘All. One of these miracles is that on the eve of the
27th Rajab® cripples from the two ‘Iraqs, Khurasan,
Persia and Anatolia, numbering about thirty or forty
in all, are brought here and placed on the holy tomb.
Those present await their arising and pass the time in
prayer, or reciting litanies, or reading the Koran or
contemplating the tomb. When the night is half or
two-thirds over or so, they all rise completely cured,
saying “There is no God but God; Muhammad is
the Prophet of God and ‘All is the Friend of God.”
This faft is widely known among them, and I heard
of it from trustworthy authorities, but I was not
adtually present on any such night. I saw however
three cripples in the GueSts’ College and asked them
about themselves, and they told me that they had'
missed the night and were waiting for it in a future
year. This town pays no taxes or dues and has no
governor, but is under the sole control of the Naqib
al-Ashraf [Keeper of the Register of the descendants
of the Prophet]. Its people are traders of great
enterprise, brave and generous and excellent company
on a journey, but they are fanatical about ‘AH. If
any of them suifers from illness in the head, hand,
foot, or other part of the body, he makes a model of
the member in gold or silver and brings it to the
sanctuary. The treasury of the sanctuary is consider-



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

able and contains innumerable riches. The Naqlb
al-Ashrdf holds a high position at the court. When
he travels he has the same retinue and ^atus as the
principal military officers, with banners and kettle-
drums. Military music is played at his gate every
evening and morning. Before the present holder of
the office it was held jointly by a number of persons,
who took turns of duty as governor.

One of these personages was the Sharif Abii Ghurra.
In his youth he was given over to devotions and ^udy,
but after his appointment as Naqib al-Ashrdf he was
overcome by the world, gave up his ascetic habits,
and admini^ered his finances corruptly. The matter
was brought before the sultan, and Abii Ghurra, on
hearing of this, went to Khurdsdn and thence made
for India. After crossing the Indus, he had his drums
beaten and his trumpets blown, and thereby terrified
the villagers, who, imagining that the Tatars had come
to raid their country, fled to the city of Uja [Uch]
and informed its governor of what they had heard.
He rode out with his troops and prepared for battle,
when the scouts whom he had sent out saw only about
ten 'horsemen and a number of men on foot and
merchants who had accompanied the Sharif, carrying
banners and kettledrums. They asked them what they
were doing and received the reply that the Sharif,
the Naqib of *Iriq, had come on a mission to the
king of India. The scouts returned with the news
to the governor, who thought that the Sharif muft
be a man of little sense to raise banners and beat
drums outside his own country. The Sharif ftayed
for some time at Uja, and every morning and evening
he had the drums beaten at the door of his house, for
that used to give him much gratification. It is said
that when the drums were beaten before him in Trdq,
as the drummer finished beating he would say to him
“ One more roll, drummer,” until these words Stuck

to him as a nickname. The governor of Oja wrote
to the king of India about the Sharif and his drum-
beating, both on his journey and before his house
morning and evening, as well as flying banners. Now
the cuftom in India is that no person is entitled to
use banners and drums except by special privilege from
the king, and even then only while travelling. At
re^ no drums are beaten except before the king’s
house alone. In Egypt, Syria and ‘Iraq, on the other
hand, drums are beaten before the houses of the mili-
tary governors. The king was therefore displeased
and annoyed at the Sharif’s aftion. Now it happened
that as the Sharif approached the capital, with his
drums beating as usual, suddenly he met the sultan,
with his cortege on his way to meet the amir of Sind.
The Sharif went forward to the sultan to greet him,
and the sultan, after asking how he was and why he
had come and hearing his answers, went on to meet
the amir, and returned to the capital, without paying
the slightest attention to the Sharif or giving orders
for his lodging or anything else. He was then on
the point of setting out for Dawlat Abad, and before
going he sent the Sharif 500 dinars (which equal
125 of our Moroccan dinars) and said to the mes-
senger : “ Tell him that if he wants to go back to his
country, this is his travelling provision, and if he wants
to come with us it is for his expenses on the journey,
but if he prefers to ^ay in the capital it is for his
expenses until we return.” The Sharif was vexed at
this for he was desirous that the sultan should make
as rich presents to him as he usually did to his equals.
He chose to travel with the sultan and attached
himself to the wazir, who came to regard him with
affeftion, and so used his influence with the king that
he formed a high opinion of him, and assigned him
two villages in the di^ria of Dawlat Abad, with the
order to reside in them. For eight years the Sharif

ilaycd there, colle^ing the revenue of these two
villages, and amassed considerable wealth. There-
upon he wanted to leave the country but could not,
since those who are in the king’s service are not allowed
to leave without his permission, and he is much
attached to strangers and rarely gives any of them
leave. The SharTf tried to escape by the coaft road,
but was turned back; then he went to the capital and
by the wazfr’s good offices received the sultan’s per-
mission to leave India, together with a gift of 10,000
Indian dinars. The money was given him in a sack,
and he used to sleep on it, out of his love of money,
and fear leit some of it should get to any of his com-
panions. As a result of sleeping on it he developed
a pain in his side as he was juA about to ^art on his
journey, and eventually he died twenty days after
receiving the sack. He bequeathed the money to
the Sharif Hasan al-Jaidnf, who diAributed the whole
amount in alms to the Shl’ites living in Delhi. The
Indians do not sequeArate inheritances for the treasury,
and do not interfere with the property of Arangers
nor even make enquiries about it, however much it
may be. In the same way, the negroes never interfere
with the property of a white man, but it is left in
charge of the principal members of his company until
the rightful heir comes to claim it.

After our visit to the tomb of the Caliph *AH, the
caravan went on to Baghddd, but I set out for Basra,
in the company of a large troop of the Arab inhabitants
of that count^. They are exceedingly brave and it
is impossible to travel in those regions except in their
company. Our way lay along the Euphrates by the
place called al-‘Idhdr, which is a waterlogged jungle
of reeds, inhabited by Arabs noted for their predatory
habits. They are brigands and profess adhesion to
the Shi‘ite seA. They attacked a party of darwlshes
behind us and Aripped them of everything down to



SELECTIONS FROM THE

their shoes and wooden bowls. They have fortified
positions in this jungle and defend themselves in
these again^ all attacks. Three days’ march through
this di^triiS: brought us to the town of 'Wasit. Its
inhabitants are among the be^ people in ‘Iraq —
indeed, the very be^ of them without qualification.
All the ‘Iraqis who wish to learn how to recite the
Koran come here, and our caravan contained a number
of ^udents who had come for that purpose. As the
caravan ^ayed here three days, I had an opportunity
of visiting the grave of ar-Rifa‘i, which is at a village
called Umm ‘Ubayda, one day’s journey from there.
I reached the establishment at noon the next day and
found it to be an enormous mona^ery, containing
thousands of darwishes.® After the mid-afternoon
prayer drums and kettledrums were beaten and the
darwishes began to dance. After this they prayed
the sunset prayer and brought in the meal, consi^ing
of rice-bread, fish, milk and dates. After the night
prayer they began to recite their litany. A number
of loads of wood had been brought in and kindled
into a flame, and they went into the fire dancing;
some of them rolled in it and others ate it in their
mouths until they had extinguished it entirely. This
is the peculiar cu^om of the Ahmadf darwfshes. Some
of them take large snakes and bite their heads with
their teeth until they bite them clean through.

After visiting ar-Rifa‘f’s tomb I returned to Wasit,
and found that the caravan had already Parted, but
overtook them on the way, and accompanied them
to Basra. As we approached the city I had remarked
at a di^ance of some two miles from it a lofty building
resembling a fortress. I asked about it and was told
that it was the mosque of ‘AH. Basra was in former
times a city so va^ that this mosque ^ood in the
centre of the town, whereas now it is two miles outside
it. Two miles beyond it again is the old wall that

86



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

encirdcd'the town, so that It ^ands midway bct^vccn
the old wall and the present city.^ Basra is one of
the metropolitan cities of Triq, and no place on earth
excels it m quantity of palm-groves. The current
price of dates in its market is fourteen pounds to an
4r4ql dirham, which is one-third of a nuqra.* The
qddi sent me a hamper of dates that a man could
scarcely carry; I sold them and received nine dirhams,
and three of those were taken by the porter for carrying
the basket from the house to the market. The in-
habitants of Basra possess many excellent qualities;
they are affable to strangers and give them their due,
so that no dlran^cr ever feels lonely amongdl them.
They hold the hriday service in the mosque of *Alf
mentioned above, but for the rcA of the week it is
closed. I was present once at the Friday service in
this mosque and when the preacher rose to deliver
his discourse he committco many gross errors of
grammar.^ In aAonishment at this I spoke of it to
the qddf and this is what he said to me: In this town
there is not a man left who knows anything of the
science of grammar.” Here Is a lesson for those who
will rcflcdl on it — Magnified be He who changes all
things I This Basra, in whose people the mailcry of
grammar reached its height, from whose soil sprang
Its Crunk and its branches, among^ whose inhabitants
is numbered the leader whose primacy is undisputed —
the preacher in this town cannot deliver a discourse
without breaking its rules 1

At Basra I embarked in a sumbuq-, that is a small
boat, for Ubulla,'® which lies ten miles diflant. One
travels between a constant succession of orchards and
palm-groves both to right and left, with merchants
sitting in the shade of the trees selling bread, fish,
dates, milk and fruit. Ubulla was formerly a large
town, frequented by merchants from India and Fdrs,
but it fell into decay and is now a village. Here we

87



SELECTIONS FROM THE

embarked after sunset on a small ship belonging to
a man from Ubulla and in the morning rpched
‘Abbadan, a large village on a salt plain with no
cultivation. I was told that there was at ‘Abbddan
a devotee of great merit, who lived in complete soli-
tude. He used to come down to the shore once a
month and catch enough fish for his month’s pro-
visions and then disappear again. I made it my
business to seek him out, and found him praying in
a ruined mosque. When he had finished praying he
took my hand and said “ May God grant you your
desire in this world and the next.” I have indeed —
praise be to God — attained my desire in this world,
which was to travel through the earth, and I have
attained therein what none other has attained to my
knowledge. The world to come remains, but my
hope is ^rong in the mercy and clemency of God.
My companions afterwards went in search of this
devotee, but they could get no news of him. That
evening one of the darwishes belonging to the religious
house at which we had put up met him, and he gave
him a fresh fish saying Take this to the gue^ who
came today.” So the darwish said to us as he came
in “ Which of you saw the Shaykh today ?” I replied
“ I saw him,” and he said “ He says to you ‘ This is
your hospitality gift.’ ” I thanked God for that, then
the darwish cooked the fish for us and we all ate of
it. I have never ta^ed better fish. For a moment
I entertained the idea of spending the re^l of my life
in the service of this Shaykh, but my spirit, tenacious
of its purpose, dissuaded me.

We sailed thereafter for Majdl. I made it a habit
on my journey never, so far as possible, to cover a
second time any road that I had once travelled. I
was aiming to reach Baghdad, and a man at Basra
advised me to travel to the country of the Lfirs, thence
to Iraq al- Ajam and thence to ‘Irdq al-‘Arab, and I

88



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

followed his counsel. Four days later we reached
a small place on the Persian Gulf, and thence
I hired a mount from some grain-merchants. After
travelling for three nights across open country inhabited
by nomadic Kurds we reached Rimiz [Rdm-hurmuzJ,
a fine city with fruit trees and rivers, where I dlayed
only one night before continuing our journey for three
nights more across a plain inhabited by Kurds. At
the end of each dtage there was a hospice, at which
every traveller was supplied with bread, meat, and
sweetmeats. Thereafter I came to the city of Tudtar
[Shushtar] which is situated at the edge of the plain
and the beginning of the mountains. I dlayed there
sixteen days at the madrasa of the Shaykh Sharaf
ad-Din Miisd, one of the handsome^ and modi upright
of men. He preaches every Friday after the midday
service, and when I heard him, all the preachers whom
I had heard previously in the Hijiz, Syria and Egypt
sank in my eslimation, nor have I ever met his equal.
One day I was present with him at a gathering of
notables, theologians and darwlshes in an orchard on
the river-bank. After he had served them all with
food, he delivered a discourse with solemnity and
dignity. When he finished, bits of paper were thrown
to him from all sides, for it is a cudlom of the Persians
to jot down questions on scraps of paper and throw
them to the preacher, who answers them. The
shaykh collefted them all and began to answer them
one after the other in the modi remarkable and elegant
manner.

From Tudlar we travelled three nights through
lofty mountains, halting at a hospice at each dlation,
and came to the town or Idhaj, also called Mdl al-Ami'r,
the capital of the sultan Atibeg (which is a title
common to all the rulers of that country}.^ I wished
to see the sultan, but that was not easiW come by, as
he goes out only on Fridays because or his addition

SELECTIONS FROM THE

to wine. Some days later the sultan sent me an
invitation to visit him. I went with the messenger
to the gate called the Cypress Grate, and we mounted
a long staircase, finally reaching a room, which was
unfurnished because they were in mourning for the
sultan’s son. The sultan was sitting on a cushion,
with two covered goblets in front of him, one of gold
and the other of silver. A green rug was spread for
me near him and I sat down on this. No one else
was in the room but his chamberlain and one of his
boon-companions. The sultan asked me about niyself
and my country, the sultan of Egypt, and the Hijaz,
and I answered all his questions. At this juncture
a noted do£lor of the law came in, and as the sultan
ilarted praising him I began to see that he was
intoxicated. Afterwards he said to me in Arabic,
which he spoke well, “ Speak.” I said to him “ If
you will li^en to me, I say to you ‘ You are a son
of a sultan noted for piety and uprightness, and there
is nothing to be brought again^ you as a ruler but
this,’ ” and I pointed to the goblets. He was over-
come with confusion at what I said, and sat silent.
I wished to go, but he bade me sit down and said to
me, “To meet with men like you is a mercy.” Then
I saw him reeling and on the point of falling asleep,
so I withdrew. I could not find my sandals, but the
dodfor I have mentioned went up and found them in
the room and brought them to me. His kindness
ashamed me and I made my excuses, but thereupon he
kissed my sandals and put them on his head saying “ God
bless you. What you said to the sultan none could say
but you. I hope this will make an impression on him.”

A few days later I left Idhaj, and the sultan sent
me a number of dinars [as a farewell gift] with a like
sum for my companions. For ten days we continued
to travel in the territories of this sultan amiddl high
mountains, halting every night at a madrasa, where

90



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

each traveller was supplied with food for himself and
forage for his beail. Some of the madrasas arc in
desolate localities, but all their requirements are trans-
ported to them. One-third of the revenues of the
Aatc is devoted to the maintenance of these hospices
and madrasas. We travelled on across a well-watered
plain belonging to the province of the city of Isfahln,
passing througn the towns of Ushturkin and Finiain.
On reaching the latter place we found its inhabiunts
outside the town escorting a funeral. They had
torches lit behind and in front of the bier, and they
followed it up with fifes and singers, singing all sorts
of merry songs. We were amazed at their conduA.
The next day our way lay through orchards and
ftreams and fine villages, with very many pigeon
towers, and in the afternoon we reached Isfahin or
Ispahdn, in Trig al-‘Ajam. Isfahin is one of the
largeil and faireit of cities, but the greater part of it
is ndw in ruins, as a result of the feud between Sunnis
and Shi'ites, which is ftill raging there. It is rich
in fruits, among its produfU being apricots of un-
equalled quality with sweet almonds in their kernels,
quinces whose sweetness and size cannot be paralleled,
splendid grapes, and wonderful melons. Its people
are goodlooking, with clear while skins tingea with
red, exceedingly brave, generous, and always trying
to outdo one another in procuring luxurious viands.
Many curious Tories are told of this laA trait in them.
The members of each trade form corporations, as
also do the leading men who arc not engaged in trade,
and the young unmarried men; these corporations
then engage in mutual rivalry, inviting one another
to banquets, in the preparations for which they display
all their resources. I was told that one corporation
invited another and cooked its viands with lighted
candles, then the guefls returned the invitation and
cooked their viands with silk.

SELECTIONS FROM THE

We then set out from Isfahan on purpose to visit
the Shaykh Majd ad-Din at Shiraz, which is ten days’
journey from there. After six days’ travelling we
reached Yazdikhwd^, outside of which there is a
convent where travellers dlay. It has an iron gate
and is extremely well fortified; inside it are shops at
which the travellers can buy all that they need. Here
they make the cheese called Yazdikhwadli, which is
unequalled for goodness; each cheese weighs from
two to four ounces. Thence we travelled across a
dlretch of open country inhabited by Turks, and
reached Shiraz, a densely populated town, well built
and admirably planned. Each trade has its own
bazaar. Its inhabitants are handsome and clean in
their dress. In the whole Eadt there is no city that
approaches Damascus in beauty of bazaars, orchards
and rivers, and in the handsome figures of its inhabi-
tants, but Shiraz. It is on a plain surrounded by
orchards on all sides and intersefted by/ivers, one of
which is the river known as Rukn Abad,^® whose
water is sweet, very cold in summer and warm in
winter. The people of Shiraz are pious and upright,
especially the women, who have a Grange cu^om.
Every Monday, Thursday, and Friday they meet in
the principal mosque to li^en to the preacher, one or
two thousand of them, carrying fans with which they
fan themselves on account of the great heat. I have
never seen in any land so great an assembly of
women.

On entering Shiraz I had but one desire, which
was to seek out the illu^rious Shaykh Majd ad-Din
Isma‘il, the marvel of the age. As I reached his
dwelling he was going out to the afternoon prayer;
I saluted him and he embraced me and took my hand
until he came to his prayer mat, when he signed me
to pray beside him. After this, the notables of the
town came forward to salute him, as is their cu^om

92

morning and evening, then he asked me about my
jotirney and the lands I had visited, and gave orders
to lodge me in- his madrasa. The Shaykh Majd
ad-Dln is held in the highest e^leem by the king
of Trdq, for reasons which the following dlory wiU
show. The pate] king of Trdq, Sultan Muhammad
Khuddbanda,'* had as a companion, while he was yet
an infidel, a Shi'ite theologian, and when the sultan
embraced Isldm together with the Tatars, he showed
the greatedl respeft for this man, who persuaded him
to establish the Shi'ite faith throughout his dominions.
At Baghddd, Shirdz, and Isfahdn the population pre-
vented the execution of the order, whereupon the king
ordered the qddls of these three towns to be brought.
The firdl of them to be brought was the qddf Majd
ad-Dfn of Shlrdz. The sultan was then at a place
called Qardbdgh,“ which was his summer residence,
and when the qddl arrived, he ordered him to be
thrown to the do^s which he had there. These are
enormous dogs with chains on their necks, trained to
eat men. when anyone is brought to be delivered
to the dogs, he is placed at liberty and without chains
in a wide plain; the dogs are then loosed on him and
he flees, but finds no refuge; they overtake him and
tear him to pieces and eat his flesh. But when the
dogs were loosed on the qadl Majd ad-Dln, they
would not attack him but wagged their tails before
him in the friendlie^l manner. The sultan, on hearing
of this, showed the greater reverence and respeft to
him, and _ renounced the doctrines of the Shi'ites.
He made va^l presents to the qddl, including a hundred
of the villages of Jamkdn, which is the be^l di^lrift
m Shlrdz. I met the qddl again on my return from
India in 1347. He was then too weak to walk, but
he recognized me and rose to embrace me. I visited
him one day and found the sultan of Shfrdz sitting in
front of him, holding his own ear. This is the height
93

of good manners among^ them, and all the people
do so when they sit in the presence of the king.

The sultan of Shiraz at the time of my visit was
Abii Ishdq,^® one of the be^ of sultans, handsome
and well-condufted, of generous charadler, humble,
but powerful and the 'ruler of a great kingdom. He
has an army of more than fifty thousand men, Turks
and Persians, but he does not tru^ the people of
Shiraz. He will not take them into his service, and
allows none of them to carry arms, because they are
very brave and apt to rise againil their rulers. He
made himself ma^er of Shiraz, as well as of Fdrs and
Isfahan, after the death of Sultan Abii Sa‘id [in I335]>
when every amir seized what he possessed. At one
time Sultan Abii Ishaq desired to build a palace
like the Aywan Kisra,^'^ and ordered the inhabitants
of Shiraz to undertake the digging of its foundations.
They set to work on this, each corporation of artisans
rivalling the other, and carried their rivalry to such
lengths that they made baskets of leather to carry the
earth and covered them with embroidered silk. They
did the same with the donkey panniers. Some of
them made tools of silver, and lit numerous candles.
When they went to dig they put on their be^l garments,
with girdles of silk, and the sultan watched their work
from a balcony. When the foundations were dug the
inhabitants were freed from service, and paid artisans
took their place. Several thousands of them were
colledled for this work, and I heard from the governor
of the town that the greater part of its taxes were spent
on it. Abii Ishaq wished to be compared to the king
of India for the magnificence of his gifts, but “ How
distant are the Pleiads from the clod!” The largest
gift of Abii Ishaq that I ever heard tell of was that
he gave an ambassador from the king of Herat seventy
thousand’ dinars, whereas the king of India never
ceases to give many times 'more than that to an in-

94



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

numerable number of persons. One instance may be
cited.

The amir Bakht one day felt indisposed at the
capital of the king of India, who went to visit him.
As the king entered he wished to rise, but the king
swore that he mu^ not come down from his bed.
A divan was brought on which the sultan sat down.
He then called for gold and a balance, and when
these were brought he ordered the sick man to sit
on one of the trays. The amir said, O mailer of
the world, had I known that you would do this, I
should have put on many clothes.” The sultan
replied, “Put on now all the clothes that you have.”
So he put on the clothes that he wore in the cold
weather, which were padded with cotton-wool, and
sat on one of the trays of the balance. The other
was filled with gold until it tipped down, when the
king said “ Take this, and give it in alms for your
recovery,” and left him.

Shlrdz contains many sanftuaries which are visited
and venerated by its inhabitants. Among them is
the tomb of the imdm ‘AbdalUh ibn Khafif, who is
known there simply as “ The Shaykh.” He occupies
a high place among the saints, and the following ilory
is told of him. One day he went to the mountain
of Sarandlb [Adam’s Peak] in the island of Ceylon
accompanied by about thirty darwlshes. They were
overcome by hunger on the way, in an uninhabited
locality, and loft their bearings. They asked the
shaykh to allow them to seize one of the small elephants,
of which there arc a very large number in that place,
and which are transported thence to the king of India.
The shaykh forbade them, but their hunger got the
better or them and they disobeyed him and, seizing
a small elephant, killed and ate it. The shaykh
however refused to eat it. That night, as they slept,
the elephants gathered from all quarters and came

95



SELECTIONS FROM THE

upon them, smelling each one of them and killing
him until they had made an end of them all. They
smelled the sh^kh too but offered no violence to him;
one of them lifted him with its trunk, put him on its
back, and brought him to the inhabited di^rift.
When the people of that part saw him, they marvelled
at him and came to out meet him and hear his ^oiy.
As it came near them, the elephant lifted him with its
trunk and placed him on the ground in full view of
them.

I visited this island of Ceylon. Its people ^ill live
in idolatry [Buddhism], yet they show respefl for
Muslim darwfshes, lodge them in their houses, and
give them to eat, and they live in their houses amid^
their wives and children. This is contrary to the
usage of the other Indian idolaters [Brahmans and
Hindus], who never make friends with Muslims, and
never give them to eat or to drink out of their vessels,
although at the same time they neither aft nor speak
offensively to them. We were compelled to have
some flesh cooked for us by some of them, and they
would bring it in their pots and sit at a diftance from
us. They would also serve us with rice, which is
their principal food, on banana leaves, and then go
away, and what we left over was eaten by dogs and birds.
If any small child, who had not reached the age of
reason, ate any of it, they would beat him and make
him eat cow dung, this being, as they say, the purifica-
tion for that aft.

Among the sanftuaries outside Shfraz is the grave
of the pious shaykh known as as-Sa‘df,^® who was the
greateft poet of his time in the Persian language, and
sonietimes introduced Arabic verses into his com-
positions. There is a fine hospice which he built
in this place having a beautiful garden within it, close
by the source of the great river known as Rukn Abad.
The Shaykh [Sa‘df] had conftrufted some small cifterns

Shiriz go out to visit his tomb, and they cat from his
table cat food prepared at the convent] and wash
their dothes in the river. I did the same thing there
•~may God have mercy upon him!

I left Shirdz to visit the tomb of the pious shaykh
Ab\^ Ishiq al>Kizardn( at Kizan^n, which lies two
days* journey [wc^] from Shiriz. This shaykh is
held in high honour by the inhabitants of India and
China. Travellers on the Sea of China, when the
wind turns againR them and they fear pirates, usually
make vows to Abd Ishiq, each one setting down in
writii^ what he has vowed. When they reach safety
the omeers of the convent go on board the ship, receive
the Ii£l, and take from each person the amount of his
vow. There is not a ship coming from India or China
but has thousands of dinars in it [vowed to the saint].
Any mendicant who comes to beg alms of the shaykn
is given an order, sealed with the snaykh*s seal flampcd
fn red wax, to this cfTe^l: ** Let any person who nas
made a vow to the Shaykh Abd Ishici give thereof
to so>and>so so much,’* specifying a inousand or a
hundred, or more or less. When the mendicant finds
anyone who has made a vow, he takes from him the
sum named and writes a receipt for the amount on
the back of the order.

From Kdzan^n we went by way of Zayddn to
Huwayza, and thence by a five days* march through
waterless desert to Kdfa.'® Though it was once the
abode of the Companions of the Prophet and of scholars
and theologians, and the capital of 'All, the Commander
of the Faithful, Kdfa has now fallen into ruins, as
a result of the attacks which it has suifered from the
nomad Arab brigands in the neighbourhood. The
town is unwalled. Its principal mosque is a magni*
ficent building with seven naves supported by great
pillars of immense height, made or carved Aones

placed one on top of the other, the inter^ices being
filled with molten lead. We resumed our journey and
halted for the night at Bi’r Mallaha [“ Salt Well ”],
which is a pretty town lying among^ palm gardens.
I encamped outside it, and would not enter the place,
because the inhabitants are fanatical Shi'ites.

Next morning we went on and alighted at the city
of Hilla, which is a large town lying along the we^ern
bank of the Euphrates, with fine markets where both
natural produfts and manufadfured goods may be
had. At this place there is a great bridge fa^ened
upon a continuous row of boats from bank to bank,
the boats being held in place both fore and aft by
iron chains attached on either bank to a huge wooden
beam made fa^l ashore. The inhabitants of Hilla
are all Shi‘ites of the “ Twelvers ” seft, but they are
divided into two factions, known as the “ Kurds ”
and the “ Party of the Two Mosques,” between whom
there is con^ant factional ^rife and fighting. Near
the principal market in this town there is a mosque,
the door of which is covered with a silk curtain. They
call this the Sanctuary of the Ma^er of the Age.^
Every evening before sunset, a hundred of the towns-
men, following their cu^om, go with arms and drawn
swords to the governor of the city and receive from
him a saddled and bridled horse or mule. With this
they go in procession, with drums beating and
trumpets and bugles blowing, fifty of them in front
of it and fifty behind, while others walk to right and
left, to the Sandluary of the Ma^er of the Age. They
halt at the door and call out “ In the Name of God,
O Master of the Age, in the Name of God, come forth!
Corruption is abroad- and inju^ice is rife! This is
the hour for thy advent, that by thee God may discover
the true from the false.” They continue to call out
thus, sounding their drums and bugles and trumpets,
until the hour of sunset prayer, for they hold that

Muhammad, the son of aI«Hasan al- Askar/, entered
this mosque and disappeared from sight in it, and that
he will emerge from it, for he, in their view, is the
“ Expefted Imim.”

We travelled thence to the town of Karbald, the
shrine of al-Husayn, the son of *AH.** The sur-
roundings of the tomb and the ceremonies of visitation
resemble those of the tomb of *AH at Najaf. In this
town too the inhabitants form two fa^ions between
whom there is conilant hghtlng, although they are all
Shi'ites and descended from the same family, and as
a result of their feuds the town is in ruins.

Thence we travelled to Baghdid, the Abode of
Peace and Capital of Islim.^ Here there are two
bridges like that at Hllla, on which the people
promenade night and day, both men and women,
^e town has eleven cathedral mosques, eight on the
right bank and three on the left, together with very
many other mosaucs and madrasas, only the latter are
all in ruins. The baths at Baghdid are numerous
and excellently conflru£lcd, moR of them being
painted with pitch, which has the appearance of black
marble. This pitch is brought from a spring between
Kdfa and Basra, from which it flows continually. It
gathers at the sides of the spring like clay and is
shovelled up and brought to Baghdid. Each eilab-
lishment has a large number of private bathrooms,
every one of which has also a wash'^oasin in the corner,
with two taps supplying hot and cold water. Every
bather is given three towels, one to wear round his
waiR when he goes in, another to wear round his walR
when he comes out, and the third to dry himself with.
In no town other than Baghdid have I seen all this
elaborate arrangement, though some other towns
approach it in this respeft." The weAern part of
Baghdid was the earlicR to be built, but it is now for the
moA part in ruins. In spite of that there remain in

it ^ill thirteen quarters, each like a city in itself and
possessing two or three baths. The hospital (mari^tan)
is a va^ ruined edifice, of which only ve^iges remain.
The eaftern part has an abundance of bazaars, the
larged of which is called the Tuesday bazaar. On
this side there are no fruit trees, but all the fruit is
brought from the weftern side, where there are orchards
and gardens.

My arrival at Baghddd coincided with a visit of the
sultan of the two ‘Iraqs and of Khurasan, the illus-
trious Abii Sa‘ld Bahadur Khdn,^"^ son of Sultan
Muhammad Khudabanda whose conversion we re-
lated above. He was an excellent and generous
king. He was ^ill a boy when he succeeded his
father, and the power was seized by the principal
amir, Jiiban, who left him nothing of sovereignty but
the name. This went on until one day his father's
wives complained to him of the insolence of Jfibdn’s
son Dimashq Khwaja, and the sultan had him arreted
and put to death. Jiibdn was then in Khurdsdn with
the army of the Tatars. They agreed to fight the
sultan, and marched againdl him, but when the two
forces met, the Tatars deserted to their sultan and
Jiibdn was left without support. He fled to the desert
of Siji^dn [Sidlan], and afterwards took refuge with
the king of Herdt, who betrayed him a few days later,
killed him and his youngedl son and sent their heads
to the sultan. When Abid Sa‘fd had become sole
master, he desired to marry Jfibdn's daughter, who
was called Baghddd Khdtiin, and was one of the mo^
beautiful of women. She was married to Shaykh
Hasan, the same who became mailer of the kingdom
after the death of Abii Sa‘fd, and who was his cousin
by his father’s si^er. Shaykh Hasan divorced her
on Abu Sa id’s order, and she becanie his favourite
wife. Among the Turks and the Tatars their wives
hold a high position; when they issue an order they



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

say in it “ By order of the Sultan and the Khdtdns.”
Each khdtun possesses several towns and didtrifts
and vadl revenues, and when they travel with the sultan
they have a separate camp. After this had gone on
for some time the king married a woman called
Dilshdd, of whom he was very fond.“ He neglected
Baghddd Khdtdn, who became Jealous and poisoned
him with a kerchief. On his death his line became
extinff, and the amirs seized the provinces for them-
selves. When they learned that it was Baghddd
Khdtdn who had poisoned him, they decided to put
her to death. A Greek slave, called Khwdja Lu’lu’,
who was one of the principal amirs, came to her while
she was in her bath and beat her to death with his club.
Her body lay there for some days, covered only with
a piece of sacking.

I left Baghddd with the mahalla^ of Sultan Ab\i
Sa*fd, on purpose to see the way in which the king’s
marches are condu^led, and travelled with it for ten
days, thereafter accompanying one of the amirs to the
town of Tabriz.” Wc reached the town after ten
days’ travelling, and encamped outside it in a place
called ash-Shdm. Here there is a fine hospice, where
travellers are supplied with food, consisting of bread,
meat, rice cooked in butter, and sweetmeats. The
next morning 1 entered the town and wc came to a
great bazaar, called the Ghdzdn bazaar, one of the
finedt bazaars I have seen the world over. Every
trade is grouped separately in it. I passed through
the jewellers’ bazaar, and my eyes were dazzled by
the varieties of precious dlones that I beheld. They
were displayed by beautiful slaves wearing rich gar-
ments with a wai^l-sash of silk, who 5lood in front
of the merchants, exhibiting the jewels to the wives
of the Turks, while the women were buying them in
large quantities and trying to outdo one another. As
a result of all this I witnessed a riot — may God preserve



SELECTIONS FROM THE

us from such ! We went on into the ambergris and
musk market, and witnessed another riot like it or
worse.

We spent only one night at Tabriz. Next day the
amir received an order from the sultan to rejoin him,
so I returned along with hiin, without having seen any
of the learned men there. On reaching the camp the
amir told the sultan about me and introduced me
into his presence. The sultan asked me about my
country, and gave me a robe and a horse. The amir
told him that I was intending to go to the Hijdz,
whereupon he gave orders for me to be supplied with
provisions and to travel with the cortege of the com-
mander of the pilgrim caravan, and wrote in^ruftions
to that eifefl: to the governor of Baghdad. I returned
therefore to Baghddd and received in full what the
sultan had ordered. As more than two months
remained before the period when the pilgrim caravan
was to ser out, I thought it a good plan to make a
journey to Mosul and Diyar Bakr to see those di^rifts,
and then return to Baghdad when the Hijdz caravan
was due to ^tart.

Leaving Baghddd we reached a Elation on the
Dujayl canal, which is derived from the Tigris and
waters a large traft of villages, and two days later
stopped at a large village called Harba. From there
we travelled to a place on the Tigris near a fort called
al-Ma‘shdq, opposite which on the eastern bank, is
the town of Surra-man-ra’a or Sdmarrd. This town
is a total ruin and only a very small part of it remains.
It has an equable climate and is exceedingly beautiful
in spite of its disasters and the ruins of its noble
buildings.^^® One day further on we reached Takn't,
a large ^ city with fine markets and many mosques,
whose inhabitants are di^inguished by their good
qualities. Two marches from there brought us to
a village called al-‘Aqr, from which there is a con-

Wc came next to ^tne black land in whicli there are
uclU of pitch, like the one already mentioned between
Kiifa and Uaara, and two iU^c% on Uom these wcJIj
wc reached al-Mawiil [Mosul].

Mosul ii an ancient and prosperou* city, whose
fortress, known a» al-l fadbV [** 'I*hc I lumpback **], i»
famous for its strength. Next to it are the au!tan*3
palaces. These arc Separated from the town by a
long and broad Arcct, running from the top to the
Ijottom of the town. Round the town run two strong
walla, with cIose*set towers. So thick is the w*ali that
there arc ebambera inside it one next the other all the
way round. I have neser seen city walla like it except
at Delhi. OuLtidc (he town ia a large suburb, con-
taining mo‘.r|[uca, baths, hoilclriea and markets. It
hai a cathedral mosque on the bank of the 'Ilgfia,
round which (here arc lattice windowa of iron, and
adjoining it are platforms overlooking the river,
exceedingly bcautiuil and well conRru^cd. In front
of the mosque there ia a hospital, and (here are two
other cathedral mosques inside the (own. The
Qav'sariya of Mosul ia a fine building with iron gates.**

From Mosul wc journeved to Jaalrat ibn *Omar,
a large (own surrounded by the river, which ia the

on which Noah's vessel came to rcA. Two Aages

Nasfbfn, an ancient town of moderate size, for the moA
part in ruins, lying In a wide and fcrtiic plain. In
this town rose-water is manufaAurcd which is un-
equalled for perfume and sweetness. Round it there

SELECTIONS FROM THE

in a mountain close by- One branch enters the town,
flows amid^ its Greets and dwellings, cuts through the
court of the principal mosque, and empties into two
basins. The town has a hospital and two madrasas.

Thereafter we travelled to the town of Sinjdr,^®
which is built at the foot of a mountain. Its in-
habitants are Kurds, and are brave and generous.
We went on next to the town of Dara, a large, ancient
and gli^ening town, with an imposing fortress,®^ but
now in ruins and totally uninhabited. Outside it
there is an inhabited village in which we topped.
We journeyed on from there and reached the town of
Maridin, a great city at the foot of a hill, one of the
mo^ beautiful, striking and sub^antially built cities
in the lands of Islam. Here they manufadlure the
woollen fabrics known by its name. At Maridin
there is a fortress of exceptional height, situated on
the hilltop. The sultan of Maridin at the time of
my ^ay was al-Malik as-Sdlih.®^ There is no one in
‘Iraq, Syria or Egypt who is more openhanded than
he, and poets and darwishes come to visit him and
receive munificent gifts.

I then Parted to make my way back to Baghdad.
On reaching Mosul I found its pilgrim caravan out-
side the city setting out for Baghdad and joined them.
When we arrived at Baghdad I found the pilgrims
preparing for the journey, so I went to visit the governor
and asked him for the things which the sultan had
ordered for me. He assigned me the half of a camel-
litter and provisions and water for four persons,
writing out an order to that effedl, then sent for the
leader of the caravan and commended me to him. I
had already made the acquaintance of the latter, but
our friendship was ^rengthened and I remained under
his protedfion and favoured by his bounty, for he gave
me even more than had been ordered for me. As we
left Kiifa .1 fell ill of a diarrhoea and had to be dis-

mounted from the camel many times a day. The
commander of the caravan used to make enquiries
for my condition and give inAruftions that I should
be looked after. My illness continued until 1 reached
Mecca, the Sanfluary of God (may He exalt her
honour and greatness 1 ). I made the circuit of the
Sacred Edifice [the Ka*aba] on arrival, but I was so
weak that I had to carry out the prescribed cere-
monies seated, and I made the circuit and the ritual
visitation of Safi and Marwa riding on the amir’s
horse." When we camped at Mind I began to feel
relief and to recover from my malady. At the end
of the Pilgrimage I remained at Mecca all that year,
giving myself up entirely to pious exercises and leading
a moll agreeable eridlence. After the next Pilgrimage
[of 132^ I spent another year there, and yet another
after that.



CHAPTER III


After the Pilgrimage at the close of the year 1330
I set out from Mecca, making for Yemen. I arrived
at Judda [Jedda], an ancient town on the sea-coa^,
which is said to have been built by the Persians. A
Grange thing happened to- me here. A blind man,
whom I did not know and who did not know me,
called me by name, and taking my hand said “ Where
is the ring ?” Now, as I left Mecca, a religious
mendicant had met me and asked me for alms, and
as I had nothing with me at the time, I had given
him my ring. I told the blind man this, and he said
“ Go back and look for it, for there are names written
on it which contain a great secret.” I was greatly
astonished at him and at his knowledge of this — God
knows who he was. At the Friday service at Judda,
the muezzin comes and counts the number of the
inhabitants of the town present. If they amount to
forty the preacher holds the Friday service, but if
they are fewer he prays the midday prayer four times,
taking no account of the Strangers present, however
many they may be.

We embarked here on a boat which they called a
jalba. The Sharif Mansdr embarked on another
and desired me to accompany him, but I refused. He
had a number of camels in his jalba and that frightened
me, as I had never travelled on sea before. For two
days we sailed with a favouring wind, then it changed
and drove us out of our course. The waves came
overboard into our midSt and the passengers fell
grievously sick. These terrors continued until we

106



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

emerged at a roadstead called Ra s DawA ir^ between
Aydhdb and SawAkin. Wc landed here and found
on the shore a reed hut shaped like a mosque, inside
which were oAlrich egg-shells filled with water. We
drank from these and cooked food, A party of Bejds
came to us, so we hired camels from them and travelled
with them through a country in which there are many
gazelles. The Bejds do not cat them so they are tame
and do not run away from men. After two days’
travelling we reached the island of SawAkin fSuakinj.
It is a large island lying about six miles off the coail,
and has neither water nor cereal crops nor trees.
Water is brought to it in boats, and it has large reser-
voirs for colle&ng rainwater. The flesh of oAlriches,
gazelles and wild asses is to be had in it, and it has
many goats together with milk and butter, which is
exported to Mecca. Their cereal is jurjur^ a kind of
coarse grained millet, which is also exported to Mecca.
The sultan of Sawikin when I was there was the
Sharif Zayd, the son of the amir of Mecca.

We took ship at SawAkin for Yemen. No sailing
is done on this sea at night because of the number of
rocks in it. At nightfall they land and embark again
at sunrise. The captain of the ship Alands conAlantly
at the prow to warn the Aleersman of rocks. Six days
after leaving SawAkin we reached the town of Hali,^
a large and populous town inhabited by two Arab
tribes. The sultan is a man of excellent charaAIer,
a man of letters and a poet. I had accompanied him
from Mecca to Judda, and when I reached his city
he treated me generously and made me his guest for
several days. I embarked in a ship of his and reached
the township of Sarja, which is inhabited by Yemenite
merchants.® They are generous and open-handed,
supply food to travellers and assiAl pilgrims, trans-
porting them in their ships and providing for them
from their own funds. We Alayed at Sarja only one
107



SELECTIONS FROM THE

night as their gue^s, then sailed on to the road^ead
of al-Ahwab and thence went up to Zabid.^

Zabid is a hundred and twenty miles from San‘a,
and is after San ‘a the larged and wealthier town in
Yemen. It lies amid^ luxuriant gardens with many
breams and fruits, such as bananas and the like. It
is in the interior, not on the coa^, and is one of the
capital cities of the country. The town is large and
populous, with palm-groves, orchards, and running
streams — in faft, the pleasanter and mor beautiful
town in Yemen. Its inhabitants are charming in
their manners, upright, and handsome, and the women
especially are exceedingly beautiful. The people of
this town hold the famous [junketings called] suhut
an-nakhl in this wise. They go out to the palm-
groves every Saturday during the season of the colour-
ing and ripening of the dates.® Not a soul remains
in the town, whether of the townsfolk or of the visitors.
The musicians go out [to entertain them], and the
shopkeepers go out selling fruits and sweetmeats.
The women go in litters on camels. For all we have
said of their exceeding beauty they are virtuous and
possessed of excellent qualities. They show a pre-
dileftion for foreigners, and do not refuse to marry
them, as the women in our country do. When a
woman’s husband wishes to travel she goes out with
him and bids him farewell, and if they have a child,
it is she who takes care of it and supplies its wants
until the father returns. While he is absent she
demands nothing from him for maintenance or clothes
or anything else, and while he ^ays with her she is
content with very little for upkeep and clothing. But
the women never leave their own towns, and none of
them would consent to do so, however much she were
offered.

We went on from there to the town of Ta‘izz, the
capital of the king of Yemen, and one of the fine^

io8



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

and largcft towns in that country.” Its people arc
overbearing* insolent* and rude* as is generally the
ease in towns where kings reside. Ta'izz is made up
of three quarters; the firil is the residence of the king
and his court* the second* called ‘Udayna* is the
military flation* and the third* called al-lvlahdlib*^ is
inhabited by the commonalty, and contains the prin-
cipal market. The sultan of Yemen is Niir ad-Dln
‘AH of the house of Rasdl. He uses an elaborate
ceremonial in his audiences and progresses. The
fourth day after our arrival was a Thursday* on whieh
day the king holds a public audience. The qddl
presented me to him and I saluted him. The way in
which one salutes is to touch the ground with the
index-finger* then lift it to the head and say “ May
God prolong thy Majefly.” I did as the qddl had
don^ and the king* having ordered me to sit in front
of him* queAioned me about my country and the other
lands and princes 1 had seen. The wazir was present*
and the king ordered him to treat me honourably and
arrange for my lodging.’ After flaying there for
some days as his gueft* I set out for the town of San'd,
which was the former capital* a populous town built
of brick and plaSler* with a temperate climate and
^od water. A flrange thing about the rain in India*
Yemen* and Abyssinia is that it falls only in the hot
weather* and moflly every afternoon during that
season* so travellers always make hafle about noon
to avoid being caught by the rain* and the townsfolk
retire indoors* for their rains are heavy downpours.
The whole town of San'd is paved* so that when the
rain falls it washes and cleans all the flreets.

I travelled thence to ‘Aden* the port of Yemen*
on the coafl of the ocean. It is surrounded by moun-
tains and can be approached from one side only; it has
no crops* trees* or water* but has reservoirs in which
rainwater is collefted. The Arabs often cut off the
109



SELECTIONS FROM THE

inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until
they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth.
It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the
Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbdyat
[Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Cdlicdt, and many other
Malabar ports. There are Indian merchants living
there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants
are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some
of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that
sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large
ship with all it contains, and this is a subjedf of o^enta-
tion and rivalry among^ them. In spite of that they
are pious, humble, upright, and generous in charadfer,
treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay
in full the tithes due to God.

I took ship at ‘Aden, and after four days at sea
reached Zayla‘ [Zeila], the town of the Berberah, who
are a negro people. Their land is a desert extending
for two months’ journey from Zayla‘ to Maqdashaw.
Zayla‘ is a large city with a great bazaar, but it is the
dirtiest, moil abominable, and moil ilinking town in
the world. The reason for the ilench is the quantity
of its fish and the blood of the camels that they slaughter
in the ilreets. When we got there, we chose to spend
the night at sea, in spite of its extreme roughness,
rather than in the town, because of its filth.

On leaving Zayla‘ we sailed for fifteen days and came
to Maqdashaw [Mogdishu], which is an enormous
town. Its inhabitants are merchants and have many
camels, of which they slaughter hundreds eVery day
[for food]. When a vessel reaches the port, it is met
by sumbuqSy which are small boats, in each of which
are a number of young men, each carrying a covered
dish containing food. He presents this to ono of the
merchants on the ship saying “ This is my gue^,” and
all the others do the same. Each merchant on dis-
embarking goes only to the house of the young man

no



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

who is his hoft, except those who have made frequent
journeys to the town and know its people well; these
live where, they please. The hoft then sells his goods
for him and buys for him, and if anyone buys anything
from him at too low a price or sells to him in the
absence of his ho^, the sale is regarded by them as
invalid. This praftice is of great advantage to them.
When these young men came on board our vessel,
one of them approached me. My companions said
“This man is not a merchant, but a theologian, “
whereupon the young man called out to his friends
“ This IS the qddi's guest.” Amon^ them was one
of the qddi’s men, who went to tdl him of this, so
he came down to the beach with a number of dludents,
and sent one of them to me. When I disembarked
with my party, I saluted him and his party, and he
said “ In the name of God, let us go and salute the
Shaykh." Thereupon I said “ And who is this

Shaykh ?” He answered “ The sultan,” for they call
the sultan * the Shaykh.’ 1 said to him “ When I
have settled down I shall go to him,” and he replied
“ It is the cudlom that whenever a theologian, or sharlf,
or man of religion comes here, he mudl see the sultan
before taking his lodging.” So I went to him as
they asked. The sultan, whose name is Abd Bakr,
is of Berberah origin, and he talks in the Maqdishi
language, though he knows Arabic. When we
reached the palace and news of my arrival was sent
in, a eunuch came out with a plate containing betel
leaves and areca nuts. He gave me ten leaves and
a few nuts, the same to the qddl, and the re^l to my
companions and the qidl’s students, and then said
“ Our mailer commands that he be lodged in the
students’ house.” Later on the same eunuch brought
food from the * Shaykh’s * palace. With him came
one of the wazlrs, whose duty it was to look after the
gueils, and who said “ Our mailer greets you and bids
III



SELECTIONS FROM THE

you welcome.” We ^ayed there three days, food
being brought to us three times a day, and on the
fourth, a Friday, the qadi and one of the wazirs brought
me a set of garments. We then went to the mosque
and prayed behind the [sultan’s] screen.® When the
‘ Shaykh ’ came out I greeted him and he bade me
welcome. He put on his sandals, ordering the qadi
and myself to do the same, and set out for his palace
on foot. All the other people walked barefooted.
Over his head were carried four canopies of coloured
silk, each surmounted by a golden bird. After the
palace ceremonies were over, all those present saluted
and retired.

I embarked at Maqdashaw for the Sawahil country,
with the objeft of visiting the town of Kulwa [Kilwa,
Quiloa] in the land of the Zanj.® We came to Mam-
basa [Mombasa], a large island two days’ journey by
sea from the Sawahil country.^® It possesses no
territory on the mainland. They have fruit trees on
the island, but no cereals, which have to be brought
to them from the Sawahil. Their food consifts chiefly
of bananas and fish. The inhabitants are pious,
honourable, and upright, and they have well-built
wooden mosques. We ^ayed one night in this island,
and then pursued our journey to Kulwa, which is a
large town on the coa^. The majority of its inhabi-
tants are Zanj, jet-black in colour, and with tattoo-
marks on their faces. I was told by a merchant that
the town of Sufala lies a fortnight’s journey [south]
from Kulwa, and that gold duft is brought to Sufala
from Ydfi in the country of the Limis, which is a
month’s journey diftant from it.^^ Kulwd is a very
fine and sub^antially built town, and all its buildings
are of wood. Its inhabitants are con^antly engaged
in military expeditions, for their country is contiguous
to the heathen Zanj. The sultan at the time of my
visit was Abu’l-Muzaffar Hasan, who was noted for

II2



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

his gifts and generosity. He used to devote the fifth
part of the booty made on his expeditions to pious
and charitable purposes, as is prescrioed in the Koran, “
and I have seen him give the clothes of? his back to
a mendicant who asked him for them. When this
liberal and virtuous sultan died, he was succeeded by
his brother Diwdd, who was at the opposite pole from
him in this respe^b. Whenever a petitioner came to
him, he would say ** He who gave is dead, and left
nothing behind him to be given.” Visitors would
^ay at his court for months on end, and finally he
would make them some small gift, so that at laA
pe(^le gave up going to his gate.

From Kulwd we sailed to Dhafdri phofar], at the
extremity of Yemen. Thoroughbred horses arc ex-
ported from here to India, the passage taking a month
with a favouring wind. Dhafdri is a monthl’s journey
from 'Aden across the desert, and is situated in a
desolate locality without villages or dependencies. Its
market is one of the dirtied in the world and the moil
pcAered by flies because of the quantity of fruit and
fish sold there. Mofl of the fish arc of the kind
called sardines, which arc extremely fat in that country,
A curious fa^ is that these sardines arc the sole food
of their beails and flocks, a thing which I have seen
nowhere else. MoR of the sellers [in the market]
are female slaves, who wear black garments. The
inhabitants cultivate millet and irrigate it from very
deep wells, the water from which is raised in a large
bucket drawn up by a number of ropes attached to
the wai^ls of slaves. Their principal food is rice,
imported from India. Its population consiils of
merchants who live entirely on trade. When a vessel
arrives they take the ma^cr, captain and writer in
procession to the sultan’s palace and entertain the
entire ship’s company for three days in order to gain
the goodwill of the shipma^ers. Another curious

1x3 I



SELECTIONS FROM THE

thing is that its people closely resemble the people of
Northwe^ Africa in their cuiloms. In the neighbour-
hood of the town there are orchards with many banana-
trees. The bananas are of immense size; one which
was weighed in my presence scaled twelve ounces and
was pleasant to the ta^e and very sweet. They grow
also betel-trees and coco-palms, which are found only
in India and the town of Dhafari.^® Since we have
mentioned these trees, we shall describe them and
their properties here.

Betel-trees are grown like vines on cane trellises or
else trained up coco-palms. They have no fruit and
are grown only for their leaves. The Indians have
a high opinion of betel, and if a man visits a friend
and the latter gives him five leaves of it, you would
think he had given him the world, especially if he is
a prince or notable. A gift of betel is a far greater
honour than a gift of gold and silver. It is used in
this way. Fir^ one takes areca-nuts, which are like
nutmegs, crushes them into small bits and chews them.
Then the betel leaves are taken, a little chalk is put
on them, and they are chewed with the areca-nuts.
They sweeten the breath and aid dige^ion, prevent
the disagreeable effedls of drinking water on an empty
^omach, and ilimulate the faculties.

The coco-palm is one of the ^range^ of trees, and
looks exadlly like a date-palm. The nut resembles
a man’s head, for it has marks like eyes and a mouth,
and the contents, when it is green, are like the brain.
It has fibre like hair, out of which they make ropes,
which they use in^ead of nails to bind their ships
together and also as cables. Among^ its properties
are that it ^rengthens the body, fattens, and adds
redness to the face. If it is cut open when it is green
it gives a liquid deliciously sweet and fresh. After
drinking this one takes a piece of the rind as a spoon
and scoops out the pulp inside the nut. This taftes

I14

like an egg that has been broiled but not quite cooked*
and is nourishing. I lived on it for a year and a half
when I was in the Maldivc islands. One of its pccu*
liarities is that oil, milk and honey arc extra^cd from
it. The honey is made in this fashion. They cut
a Ralk on which the fruit grows, leaving two fingers*
length, and on this they tic a small bowl, into which
the sap drips. If this has been done in the morning,
a servant climbs un again in the evening with two
bowls, one filled witn water. He pours into the other
the sap that has cohered, then washes the Aalk, cuts
off a small piece, and tics on another bowl. The same
thing is repeated next morning until a good deal of
the sap has been collcAed, when it is cooked until
it thicKcns. It then makes an excellent honey, and
the merchants of India, Yemen, and China buy it and
take it to their own countries, where they manufaflure
sweetmeats from it. 'fhe milk is made by Aceping the
contents of the nut in water, which takes on the colour
and toAe of milk and is used along with food. To
make the oil, the ripe nuts arc peeled and the contents
dried in the sun, then cooked in cauldrons and the oil
cxtraAcd. They use it for lighting and dip bread
in it, and the women put it on their hair.

We left Dhafiri for ‘Omin in a small ship belonging
to a man from Masfra. On the second day of our
journey we disembarked at the roadAcad of Hdsik,*^
which is inhabited by Arab fishermen. Here they
have a great quantity of frankincense trees. They
have thin leaves out of which drips, when they arc
slashed, sap like milk. This turns into a gum, which
is the frankincense. The people living in this port
arc dependent on fishing for their food, and the fish
they catch is the lukhaittf which is like a dogfish.
They slice these fish up, dry them in the sun and use
them for food, and build their houses with the fish
bones, using camel skins for roofs.

SELECTIONS FROM THE

Six days later we reached the Island of Birds, which
is uninhabited. We ca^ anchor and went on shore,
and found it full of birds like blackbirds, only bigger.
The sailors brought some of their eggs, cooked and
ate them, then caught a number of the birds which
they cooked without previously slitting their throats.^®
My food during the voyage consi^ed of dried dates
and fish, for they used to fish every morning and even-
ing. The fish they caught were cut up into pieces
and broiled, and every person on board received a
portion, no preference being shown to anyone, not
even to the ma^er. We celebrated the Pilgrimage
Festival at sea, being ^ormtossed all that day from
sunrise until sunrise the next day, and in danger of
foundering. A ship in front of us was sunk, and only
one man escaped by swimming after great efforts.
We called next at the island of Masfra, a large island
whose inhabitants live entirely on fish,^® but we did
not land as the road^ead is at some di^ance from the
shore. Besides I had taken a dislike to these people
after seeing them eat birds without slitting their
throats.

We sailed for a day and a night from Masfra and,
reached the road^ead of a large village called Sfir,
from which we could see the town of Qalhat, situated
on the slope of a hill apparently close at hand.’^'’^ As
we had anchored ju^ after midday, I desired to walk
to Qalhat and spend the night there, for I had taken
a dislike to the company on the ship. On enquiry,
I was told that I should get there in the mid-afternoon,
so I hired one of the sailors as a guide. An Indian
named Khidr, who had been one of my fellow-pas-
sengers, came with me, and the re^ of my party were
left on board with my goods to rejoin me the next
day. I took with me some of my clothes, giving
them to the guide to carry to spare myself fatigue
and myself carried a lance. Now the guide wished



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

to ^teal the clothes, so he led us to an inlet of the sea
and set about crossing it with the clothes. I said
to him “ You cross over alone and leave the clothes;
if we can cross we shall, and if not we shall look for
a ford higher up.” He drew back then, and after-
wards we saw some men swimming across, so we
were convinced that he had wanted to drown us and
get away with the clothes. Though I made a show
of vivacity I was on my guard and kept brandishing
the lance, so that the guide became frightened of me.
We then came on a waterless plain and suffered greatly
from thirst, but God sent us a horseman with a com-
pany of men who gave us to drink, and wc went on,
thinking that the town was close at hand, while
aftually we were separated from it by nullahs in which
we walked for miles. In the evening the guide wished
to lead us towards the shore, where there is no road,
for the coaA is rocky, hoping that we should get iiuck
among the rocks and he would make away with the
clothes, but 1 said that we should take no road but
the one that we were on. When night fell, as I was
afraid of being molested on the road and did not
know exadlly how far we ^lill were from the town, I
decided that we should go aside from the road and
sleep. Although I was tired out I pretended to be
full of vigour, and put the clothes under my garments
and grasped my lance in my hand. My companion
was worn out, and both he and the guide slept, but
I flayed awake and every time the guide moved I
spoke to him to show him that I was awake. In the
morning I sent the guide to fetch us some water and
my companion took the clothes. We had ^lill some
ravines and nullahs to cross, but the guide brought
us water and eventually wc reached Qdhdt in a ^ate
of extreme fatigue. My feet were so swollen inside
my shoes that the blood was almost Parting from
under the nails. Then, as a final touch to our mis-
117



SELECTIONS FROM THE

fortunes, the gatekeeper insisted on taking me to be
interrogated by the governor of the town. The
governor, however, was an excellent man and very
kind, and he put me up. I stayed with him for six
days, during which I was unable to walk because of
the soreness of my feet. The town of Qalhat lies
on the shore; it has fine bazaars and an exceedingly
beautiful mosque, the wails of which are decorated
with Qashani tilework, and which occupies a lofty
situation overlooking the town and the harbour. I
ate fish there of a sort which I have found in no other
country. I preferred it to any kind of flesh and used
to eat nothing else. They broil it on the leaves of
trees and serve it with rice, which is brought to them
by sea from India. The inhabitants are traders and
live [entirely] on what comes to them from the Indian
Ocean. Whenever a vessel arrives at their town, they
show the greater joy.

We then set out for the country of ‘Oman and arrived
there after six days’ travelling.^® It is a fertile land,
with breams, trees, orchards, palm gardens, and fruit
trees of various kinds. Its capital, the town of Nazwa,
lies at the foot of a mountain and has fine bazaars and
splendid clean mosques. Its inhabitants make a habit
of eating meals in the courts of the mosques, every
person bringing what he has, and all sitting down to
the meal together, and travellers join in with them.
They are very warlike and brave, always fighting
between themselves. The sultan of ‘Oman is an
Arab of the tribe of Azd, and is called Abd Muham-
mad, which is the title given to every sultan who
governs ‘Oman.^® The towns on the coa^t are for the
mo^ part under the government of Hormuz.

I travelled next to the country of Hormuz. Hormuz
is a town on the coa^, called also Mdghi^an, and in
the sea facing it and nine miles from shore is New
Hormuz, which is an island.^® The town on it is

ii8



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

called Jarawn. It is a large and fine city, with busy
markets, as it is the port nrom which the wares from
India and Sind arc despatched to the 'Irdqs, Fdrs and
Khurdsdn. The island is saline, and the inhabitants
live on fish and dates exported to them from Basra.
They say in their tongue KhurmJ wamdhl luti pddi~
ikdhi^ which means ** Dates and fish are a roval dish.”
Water is a valuable commodity in this island. They
have wells and artificial reservoirs to coIIefV rainwater
at some diRance from the town. The inhabitants go
there with waterskins, which they fill and carry on
their backs to the shore, load them on boats and bring
them to the town. A flrange thing I saw there was
a fish's head at the gate of the cathedral mosque as
large as a hillock and with eyes like doors, and you
would see people entering byonc eye and coming out
^ the other. The sultan of Hormuz is Qutb ad-Dln
Tahamtan, a moSi generous and humble ruler, who
makes a habit of visiting every theologian or pious
man or sharlf who comes to his town and of paying
to each his due. We found him engaged in a war
with his nephews, who were in revolt. We ^ayed
there sixteen days, and when we wished to leave 1
said to one of my companions ” How can we go away
without seeing this sultan ?” So we went to the
house of the wazir, who took me by the hand and went
with me to the palace. I saw there an old man wearing
skimpy and dirty garments with a turban on his head
and a kerchief as a girdle. The wazfr saluted him
and I did the same, not knowing that he was the king,
and then I began to converse with a person I knew
who was ^landing beside him. When the wazfr
enlightened me I was covered with confusion and made
mv excuses. The king rose and went into the palace,
followed by the generals and minivers and when 1
entered with the wazfr we found him sitting on his
throne with the same shabby clothes on. He asked
II9



SELECTIONS FROM THE

me about myself and my journey and the kings I had
seen, then, after food had been served, he rose and I
said farewell to him and went away.

We set out from Hormuz to visit a saintly man in
the town of Khunjubal, and after crossing the ^rait,
hired mounts from the Turkmens who live in that
country. No travelling can be done there except in
their company, because of their bravery and knowledge
of the roads. In these parts there is a desert four
days’ journey in extent, which is the haunt of Arab
brigands, and in which the deadly samdm blows in
June and July. All who are overtaken by it perish,
and I was told that when a man has fallen a vidlim
to this wind and his friends attempt to wash his body
[for burial], all his limbs fall apart.^^ All along the
road there are graves of persons who have succumbed
there to this wind. We used to travel by night, and
halt from sunrise until late afternoon in the shade of
the trees. This desert was the scene of the exploits,
of the famous brigand Jamal al-Ldk, who had under
him a band of Arab and Persian horsemen. He used
to build hospices and entertain travellers with the
money that he gained by robbery, and it is said that
he used to claim that he never employed violence
except againdt those who did not pay the tithes on
their property. No king could do anything against
him, but afterwards he repented and gave, himself up
to ascetic pra<51:ices, and his grave is now a place of
pilgrimage. After traversing these deserts we reached
Kawra^tan, a small town with running streams and
orchards and extremely hot.^ From there we marched
through another desert like the former for three days
and reached the town of Lar,^® a large town with
perennial breams and orchards and fine bazaars. We
lodged in a convent inhabited by a group of darwishes
who have the following cu^om. They assemble in
the convent every afternoon and then go round the

120



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

houses in the town; at each house they arc given one
or two loaves and from these they supply the needs
of travellers. The householders arc used to this
prafticc and make provision for the extra loaves, in
order to assiA the darwfshcs in their di^ributlon of
food. There is a Turkmen sultan in the town of Ldr,
who sent us a hospitality gift,®^ but we did not visit
or see him.

We went on to the town of Khunjub41,“ the resi-
dence of the Shaykh Abii Bulaf, whom we had come
to visit. We lodged in his hermitage and he treated
me. kindly and sent me food and fruit by one of his
sons. From there we journeyed to the town of Qays,
which is also called Slrdf." The people of Slrdf arc
Persians of noble dlock, and amongdl them there is
a tribe of Arabs, who dive for pearls. The pearl
.fisheries are situated between Sfrdf and Bahrayn in
a calm bay like a wide river. During the months of
April and May a large number of boats come to this
place with divers and merchants from Firs, Bahrayn
and Qathlf. Before diving the diver puts on his face
a sort of tortoiseshell mask and a tortoiseshell clip on
his nose, then he- ties a rope round his waiit and dives.
They differ in their endurance under water, some of
them being able to Aay under for an hour or two
hours or less.” When he reaches the bottom of the
sea he finds the shells there ^uck in the sand between
small Aones, and pulls then out by hand or cuts them
loose with a knife which he has for the purpose, and
puts them in a leather bag slung tound his neck.
When his breath becomes rc^rifted he pulls the rope,
and the man holding the rope on the shore feels the
movement and pulls him up into the boat. The bag
is taken from him and the shells arc opened. Inside
them are found pieces of flesh which are cut out with
a knife, and when they come into contact with the air
solidify and turn into pearls. These are then collefted,
X2X

large and small together; the sultan takes his fifth and
the remainder are bought by the merchants who are
there in the boats. Mo^ of them are the creditors
of the divers, and they take the pearls in quittance of
their debt or so much of it as is their due.

From Siraf we travelled to the town of Bahrayn, a
fine large town with orchards, trees and breams.
Water is easy to get at there; all one has to do is to
scoop the ground with one’s hands It is very hot
and sandy, and the sand often encroaches on some of
its settlements. From Bahrayn we went to the town
of al-Quthayf [Qathif], a fine large town inhabited by
Arab tribes who are out-and-out Shi'ites and openly
proclaim it, fearing nobody. Next we journeyed to
the town of Hajar, which is now called al-Hasa.^®
It has become the subjeft of a proverb “ Carrying dates
to Hajar,” because there are more palms there than
in any other di^ri6f, and they even feed their bea^s
with the dates. We travelled thence to the town of
Yamama,®° in company with the governor of which I
went on to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage. This
was in the year 1332, the same year that al-Malik
an-Nasir, the sultan of Egypt, made his la^t pilgrimage.
He made munificent gifts to the inhabitants of the
twin shrines [Mecca and Madina] and to the devotees
living there, and on the same journey he put to death
by poisoning the amir Ahmad, who, it is said, was
his own son, and his principal amir Bektimur the cup-
bearer, on being warned that they were' plotting to
assassinate him and seize the throne.


122







CHAPTER IV


After the pilgrimage I went to Judda, intending to
take ship to Yemen and India, but that plan fell
throuch and I could get no one to join me. I flayed
at Judda about forty days. There was a ship there
going to Qusayr [Kosair], and I went on board to
see what £Iate it was in, but 1 was not satisfied. This
was an aft of providence, for the ship sailed and foun-
dered in the open sea, and very few escaped. After-
wards I took ship for Aydhdb, but we were driven
to a roadftcad called Ra^s Dawd’ir [p. 107J, from
which we made our way with some Bcjds through
the desert to Aydhdb. Thence we travelled to Ediu
and down the Nile to Cairo, where 1 ftayed for a few
days, then set out for Svria and passed for the second
time through Gaza, Hebron, Jerusalem, Ramlah, Acre,
Tripoli, and Jabala to Lddhiofya.

At lidhiqfya we embarked on a large galley belong-
ing to the Genoese, the maftcr of which was called
Martalmfn, and set out for the country of the Turks
known as Bildd ar-Rum [Anatolia], because it was in
ancient times their land.' Later on it was conquered
by the Muslims, but there are ftill large numbers of
ChriAians there under the government of the Turkmen
Muslims. We were ten nights at sea, and the Chris-
tian treated us kindly and took no passage money
from us. On the tenth day we reached ‘Aldyd, where
the province begins. .This country is one of the beft
in the world; in it God has united the good features
dispersed throughout other lands. Its people are the
moA comely of men, the clcaneA in their dress, the
123



SELECTIONS FROM THE

mo^ exquisite in their food, and the kindlie^l folk in
creation. Wherever we flopped in this land, whether
at a hospice or a private house, our neighbours both
men and women (these do not veil themselves) came
to ask after us. When we left them they bade us
farewell as though they were our relatives and our own
folk, and you would see the women weeping. They
bake bread only once a week, and the men used to bring
us gifts of warm bread on the day it was baked, along
with delicious viands, saying “ The women have sent
this to you and beg your prayers.” All the inhabitants
are orthodox Sunnis; there are no seftarians or heretics
among^ them, but they eat hashish [Indian hemp],
and think no harm of it.

The city of ‘Alaya is a large town on the seacoa^.^
It is inhabited by Turkmens, and is visited by the
merchants of Cairo, Alexandria, and Syria. The
diftrift is well-wooded, and wood is exported from
there to Alexandria and Damietta, whence it is carried
to the other cities of Egypt. There is a magnificent
and formidable citadel, built by Sultan ‘Ala ad-Dm,
at the upper end of the town. The qadi of the town
rode out with me to meet the king of ‘Alaya, who is
Yfisuf Bek, son of Qaraman, bek meaning king in their
language. He lives at a diftance of ten miles from
the city. We found him sitting by himself on the
top of a hillock by the shore, with the amirs and wazirs
below him, and the troops on his right and left. He
hp his hair dyed black. I saluted him and answered
his que^ions regarding my visit to his town, and after
my withdrawal he sent me a present of money.

From ‘Alaya I went to Antaliya [Adalia], a mo^
beautiful city.® It covers an immense area, and
though of valt bulk is one of the mo^ attractive towns
to be seen anywhere, besides being exceedingly popu-
lous and well laid out. Each seCtion of the inhabitants
lives in a separate quarter. The Chri^ian merchants

124



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

live in a quarter of the town known as the Mfni [the
Port], and are surrounded by a wall, the gates of
which are shut upon them from without at night and
during the Friday service/ The Greeks, who were
its former inhabitants, live by themselves in another
quarter, the Jews in another, and the king and his
court and mamluks in another, each of these quarters
being walled off likewise. The re^t of the Muslims
live in the main city. Round the whole town and all
the quarters mentioned there is another great wall.
The town contains many orchards and produces fine
fruits, including an admirable kind of apricot, called
by them Qamar ad-D/n, which has a sweet almond
in its kernel. This fruit is dried and exported to
Egypt, where it is regarded as a great luxury.

We Aayed here at the college mosque of the town,
the principal of which was Shaykh Shihdb ad-Dln
al-Hamawl. Now in all the lands inhabited by the
Turkmens in Anatolia, in every diftrift, town, and
village, there are to be found members of the organi-
zation known as the Akhlya or Young Brotherhood.
Nowhere in the world will you find men so eager to
welcome strangers, so prompt to serve food and to
satisfy the wants of others, and so ready to suppress
injuflice and to kill [tyrannical] agents of police and
the miscreants who join with them. A Young
Brother, or akhi in their language, is one who is
chosen by all the members of his trade [guild], or
by other young unmarried men, or those who live in
ascetic retreat, to be their leader. This organization
is known also as the Futuvoa^ or Order of Youth.
The leader builds a'hospice and furnishes it with rugs,
lamps, and other necessary appliances. The members
of his community work during the day to gain their
livelihood, and bring him what they have earned in
the late afternoon. With this they buy fruit, food,
and the other things which the hospice requires for

IZ5



SELECTIONS FROM THE

their use. If a traveller comes to the town that day
they lodge him in their hospice; these provisions serve
for his entertainment as their gue^l, and he ^ays with
them until he goes away. If there are no travellers
they themselves, assemble to partake of the food, and
having eaten it they sing and dance. On the morrow
they return to their occupations and bring their earn-
ings to their leader in the late afternoon. The
members are called jitydn (youths), and their leader,
as we have said, is the akhi^

The day after our arrival at Antaliya one of these
youths came to Shaykh Shihab ad-Din al-Hamawi
and spoke to him in Turkish, which I did not under-
hand at that time. He was wearing old clothes and
had a felt bonnet on his head. The shaykh said to
me “ Do you know what he is saying “ No ”
said I “ I do not know.” He answered “ He is in-
viting you and your company to eat a meal with him.”
I was ahonished but I said “Very well,” and when
the man had gone I said to the shaykh “ He is a poor
man, and is not able to entertain us, and we do not
like to be a burden pn him.” The shaykh burh out
laughing and said “ He is one of the shaykhs of the
Young Brotherhood. He is a cobbler, and a man
of generous disposition. His companions, about two
hundred men belonging to diiferent trades, have made
him their leader and have built a hospice to entertain
their gue^s. All that they earn by day 'they spend
at night.”

After I had prayed the sunset prayer the same man
came back for us and took us to the hospice. We
found [ourselves in] a fine building, carpeted with
beautiful Turkish rugs and lit by a large number of
chandeliers of ‘Iraqi glass. A number of young men
^ood in rows in the hall, wearing long mantles and
boots, and each had a knife about two cubits long
attached to a girdle around his waift. On their heads

126



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

were white woollen bonnets, and attached to the peak
of these bonnets was a piece of Sluff a cubit long and
two fingers in breadth. When they took their scats,
every man removed his bonnet and set it down in
front of him, and kept on his head another ornamental
bonnet of silk or other material. In the centre of
their hall was a sort of platform placed there for
visitors. When we took our places, they served up
a great banquet followed by fruits and sweetmeats,
after which they began to sing and to dance. We
were filled with admiration and were greatly ailonished
at their openhandedness and generosity. We took
leave of them at the close of the night and left them
in their hospice.

The sultan of Antdliya, Khidr Bek, son of Ydnus
Bek, was ill when we reached the town, but we visited
him on his sick*bcd. He spoke to us very kindly,
and when we took leave of him, sent us a gift of
money.

We travelled on to the town of Burdiir [Buldur],
a small place with many orchards and Yearns, and a
Strong fortress on a hilltop. We put up as the gucAs
of the preacher there. The brotherhood held a
meeting and wished us to ilay with them, but he would
not hear of it, so they prepared a banquet for us in
a garden belonging to one of them and conducted us
to the place. It was marvellous to see the joy and
gladness with which they received us, though they
were ignorant of our language and we of theirs, and
there was no one to interpret between us. We flayed
with them one day and then took our leave.

From Burddr we went on to Sabarta [Isparta], and
then to Akrfdfir [Egirdir], a great and populous town
with fine bazaars. There is a lake with sweet water
here on which boats go in two days to Aqshahr and
Baqshshr and other towns and villages.® The sultan
of Akrfdfir is one of the principal rulers in this country.

127



SELECTIONS FROM THE

He is a man of upright conduft and attends the after-
noon prayer at the cathedral mosque every day.
While we were there his son died and after his burial
the sultan and the indents went out to his grave for
three days. I went out with them the second day
and the sultan, seeing me walking, sent me a horse
with his apologies. On reaching the madrasa I sent
back the horse, but he returned it saying “ I gave it
as a gift, not as a loan.” He sent me also a robe and
some money.

We left there for the town of Qul Hisar [“ Lake
Fortress ”], a small town completely surrounded by
reed-grown water.”^ The only way to it is by a sort
of bridge between the rushes and the water, admitting'’
only one horseman at a time. The town, which is
on a hill in the mid^fc of the lake, is impregnable.
The sultan, who is the brother of the sultan of
Akn'ddr, was absent when we arrived, but after we
had ^ayed there some days he came back and treated
us kindly, supplying us with horses and provisions.
He sent some horsemen to escort us to the town of
Ladhiq [Denizli], as the country was infe^ed by a
troop of brigands called Jarmiyan [Kermian] who
possess a town called Kdtahiya. Ladhiq is a mo^t
important town, with seven cathedral mosques. In it
are manufaflured matchless cotton fabrics with gold
embroidered edges, which have a very long life on
account of the excellence of the cotton and of the
spinning. Mo^ of the workers are Greek women,
for there are many Greeks here, who are subjedl: to
the Muslims and pay a poll tax to the sultan. The
di^inftive mark of the Greeks is their tall peaked
hats, red or white; their women wear capacious
turbans. As we entered the town we passed through
a bazaar. Some men got down from their booths
and took our horses’ bridles, then some others objected
to their aftion and the altercation went on so long

128



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

that some of them drew knives. We of course did
not know what they were saying and were afraid of
them, thinking they were those brigands and that
this was their town. At length God sent us a man
who knew Arabic, and he explained that they were
members of two branches of the “ Young Brother-
hood,” each of whom wanted us to lodge with them.
We were amazed at their generosity. It was decided
finally that they should caA lots, and that we should
lodge firit with the winner. This being done the
prior of the hr^ hospice, Brother Sindn, conducted us
to the bath and himself looked after me; afterwards
they served up a great banouct with sweetmeats and
many fruits. Some verses of the Koran were then read
and after that they began to chant their litany and
to dance. The next day wc had an audience of the
sultan, who is one of the principal rulers in Anatolia,
and on our return were met by Brother Tdmdn, the
prior of the other hospice, who entertained us even
better than their friends had done, and sprinkled us
with rose water when wc came out of the bath.

Wc flayed at Lddhiq for some time, in view of the
dangers of the road; then, as a caravan was ready to
set out, we travelled with them for a day and part
of the next night and reached the caiUe of Tawas
[Davas]. We spent the night outside it and next
morning, on coming to the gate, we were interrogated
from the top of the wall. The commander then came
out with his troops, and after they had explored the
neighbourhood for fear of the robbers, their animals
were driven out. This is their constant praftice.
From there we went on to Mughla and thence to
Mflds, one of the finest and moft important towns in
the country. We lodged in a convent of one of the
Young Brotherhood, who outdid by far all that our
previous hoils had done in the way of generosity,
hospitality, taking us to the bath, and other praise-

worthy a6Is. The sultan of IMilas is an excellent
ruler, and keeps company with theologians. He gave
us gifts and supplied us with horses and provisions. ^

After receiving the sultan’s gift we left for the city
of Qiiniya [Konia]. It is a large town with fine
buildings, and has many breams and fruit-gardens.
The Greets are exceedingly broad, and the bazaars
admirably planned, with each craft in a bazaar of its
own. It is said that this city was built by Alexander.
It is now in the territories of Sultan Badr ad-Din ibn
Qaraman, whom we shall mention presently, but it
has sometimes been captured by the king of ‘Iraq,
as it lies close to his territories in this country. We
^ayed there at the hospice of the qadi, who is called
Ibn Qalam Shah, and is a member of the Futuwa.
His hospice is very large indeed, and he has a great
many disciples. They trace their affiliation to the
Futuwa back to the Caliph ‘All, and the di^in6tive
garment of the order in their case is the trousers,®
ju^ as the Sdfis wear the patched robe. This qadi
showed us even greater consideration and hospitdity
than our former benefaftors, and sent his son with us
in his place to the bath.

In this town is the mausoleum of the pious shaykh
Jalal ad-Din [ar-Rdmi], known as Mawldnd [“ Our
Ma^er ”]. He was held in high e^eem, and there
is a brotherhood in Anatolia who claim spiritual
affiliation with him and are called after him the
Jaldliya? The ^ory goes that Jaldl ad-Din was in
early life a theologian and a professor. One day a
sweetmeat seller came into the college-mosque with
a tray of sweetmeats on his head, and, having given
him a piece went out again. The shaykh left his
lesson to follow him and disappeared for some years.
Then^ he came back, but with a disordered mind,
speaking nothing but Persian verses which no one
could underhand. His disciples followed him and

130

wrote down his produftions, which they coUefted into
a book called The Mathnawi. This book is greatly
revered by the people of this country; they meditate
on it, teach it, and read it in their religious houses
on Thursday nights. From Qiiniya we travelled to
Ldranda [Karaman], the capital of the sultan of
Qaramin. I met this sultan outside the town as he
was coming back from hunting, and on my dismounting
to him, he dismounted also. It is the custom of the
kings of this country to dismount if a visitor dismounts
to them. This action on his part pleases them and
they show him greater honour; if on the other hand he
greets them while on horseback they are displeased
and the visitor forfeits their goodwill in consequence.
This happened to me once with one of these kings.
After I had greeted the sultan we rode back to the
town together, and he showed me the greateft
hospitality.

We then entered the territories of the king of Trig,
visiting Aqsara [AkseraiJ, where they make shcep^s
wool carpets which are cavorted as far as India, China,
and the lands of the Turks, and journeyed thence
through Nakda [Nigda] to Qaysirlya, which is one of
the largest towns in the country. In this town resides
one of the Viceroy’s khdtdns, who is related to the
king of Trdq, and like all the sultan’s relatives has
the title of ^ghd^ which means Great. We visited
her and she treated us courteously, ordering a meal
to be served for us, and when we withdrew sent us
a horse with saddle and bridle and a sum of money.
At all these towns we lodged in a convent belonging
to the Young Brotherhood. It is the cu^Iom in this
country that in towns that are not the residence of
a sultan one of the Young Brothers afts as governor,
exercising the same authority and appearing m public
with the same retinue as a king. We travelled on
to Slwas, the largest town in the country and residence

131



SELECTIONS FROM THE

of the king of ‘Irdq’s viceroy, ‘Ala ad-Din Artana.
We were met near the town by a party belonging to
the “ Young Brother ” Ahmad, and a litde later by
a party of the “ Young Brother ” Chelebi, who invited
us to ^ay with them, but we were already pledged
to the former. Our ho^s showed the utmo^ joy on
our arrival at their convent, and treated us with the
mo^ perfeft hospitality. We visited the amir ‘Aid
ad-Din Artana who, speaking in excellent Arabic,
asked me about the countries I had visited and their
sovereigns, and afterwards sent us gifts. When we
left Siwas he wrote to his lieutenants in the towns to
give us hospitality and to supply us with provisions.
We journeyed thence to Amdsiya, a large and beautiful
town with broad Greets, Kumish [Giimush Khanah],
a populous town which is visited by merchants from
‘Irdq and Syria and has silver mines, Arzanjdn, where
Armenians form the greater part of the population,
and Arz ar-Riim. This is a va^l town but is mo^y
in ruins as the result of a civil war between two Turk-
men tribes. We lodged there at the convent of the
“ Young Brother ” Tdmdn, who was said to be more
than a hundred and thirty years old. I saw him
going about on foot supported by a ^taff, with his
facvdties unimpaired and assiduous in praying at the
^ated times. All these towns belong to the king of
‘Irdq.

We went on to the town of Birgi^° where we had
been told there was a di^inguished professor called
Muhyi ad-Din. On reaching the madrasa we found
him ju^ arriving, mounted on a lively mule and wearing
ample garments with gold embroidery, with his slaves
and servants on either side of him and preceded by
the indents. He gave us a kindly welcome and
invited me to visit him after the sunset prayer. I
found him in a reception hall in his garden, which
had a ^ream of water flowing through a white marble

132



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

basin with a rim of enamelled tiles. He was occupying
a raised seat covered with embroidered cloths, having
a number of his students and slaves ^landing on either
side- of him, and when I saw him I took him for a
king. He rose to greet me and made me sit next
him on the dais, after which we were served with food
and returned to the madrasa. The sultan of Birgi
was then at his summer quarters on a mountain close
by and on receiving news of me from the professor
sent for me. When I arrived with the professor he
sent his two sons to ask how we were, and sent me
a tent of the kind they call Khargdh^ It consifts of
wooden laths put together like a dome and covered
with pieces of felt; the upper part is opened to admit
the light and air and can be closed when required.
Next day the sultan sent for us and asked me about
the countries I had visited, then after food had been
served we retired. This went on for several days, the
sultan inviting us daily to join him at his meal, and
one afternoon visiting us himself, on account of the
respeff which the Turks show for theologians. At
length we both became weary of laying on this
mountain, so the professor sent a message to the
sultan that I wished to continue my Journey, and
received a reply that we should accompany the sultan
to his palace in the city on the following day. Next
day he sent an excellent horse and descended with us
to the city. On reaching the palace we climbed a
Jong flight of ^airs with him and came to a fine audience
hall with a basin of water in the centre and a bronxe
lion at each corner of it spouting water from its mouth.
Round the hall were daises covered with carpets, on
one of which was the sultan’s cushion. When we
reached this place, the sultan removed his cushion
and sat down beside us on the carpets. The Koran-
readers, who always attend the sultan’s audiences,
sat below the dais. After syrup and biscuits had been

133



SELECTIONS FROM THE

served I spoke thanking the sultan warmly and praising
the professor, which pleased the sultan a great deal.

As we were sitting there, he said to me “ Have you
ever seen a ^lone that has fallen from the sky I
replied “ No, nor ever heard of one.” “ Well,” he
said, “a ^tone fell from the sky outside this town,”
and thereupon called for it to be brought. A great
black ^one was brought, very hard and with a glitter
in it, I reckon its weight was about a hundredweight.
The sultan sent for ^one breakers, and four of them
came and ^ruck it all together four times over with
iron hammers, but made no impression on it. I was
amazed, and he ordered it to be taken back to its place.
We ^ayed altogether fourteen days with this sultan.
Every night he sent us food, fruit, sweetmeats and
candles, and gave me in addition a hundred pieces of
gold, a thousand dirhems, a complete set of garments
and a Greek slave called Michael, as well as sending
a robe and a gift of money to each of my companions.
All this we owed to the professor Muhyi ad-Di'n —
may God reward him with good !

We went on through the town of Tira, which is in
the territories of this sultan, to Aya Suliiq [Ephesus],
a large and ancient town venerated by the Greeks. It
possesses a large church built of finely hewn ftones
each measuring ten or more cubits in length. The
cathedral mosque, which was formerly a church greatly
venerated by the Greeks, is one of the moft beautiful
in the world. I bought a Greek slave girl here for
forty dinars. Thence we went to Yazmir [Smyrna],
a large town on the coa^, moflly in ruins. The
governor ‘Omar, a son of the sultan of Aydin, came
to the convent to visit me and sent me a large hospi-
tality-gift. Afterwards he gave me a young Greek
slave named Nicolas. He was a generous and pious
prince^ and con^antly engaged in war with the
Christians. He had galleys, with which he used to

134



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

make raids on the environs of Conilontinople the
Great, taking prisoners and booty and after spending
it ali in largesse he would make another raid. Eventu-
ally the Greeks, under the pressure of his attacks,
appealed to the Pope, who ordered the ChriAians of
Genoa and France to make an attack on him. They
did so, and the Pope sent an army from Rome, which
captured the port and the city in a night atuck. The
amir ‘Omar went down from the citadel and fought
them, but he died a martyrs death together with a
number of his troops. The ChriAians established
themselves in the city, but could not capture the
citadel on account of its Arcncth.’^

We travelled thence to Maghnisip [Magnesia,
now Manisa] where we prayed the FcAival Prayer [of
the Pilgrimage] in the company of Sultan Sardkhin.
Here my slave, on taking my horses to water along
with a slave belonging to one of my companions,
attempted to escape. The sultan sent in pursuit of
them, but as ever)*onc was occupied with the fcAival,
they were not found. They made for a town on the
coaA named Fdja belonging to the infidels, who
send a gift to the sultan every year, in return for which
he is content to leave them alone because of the
Arength of their city. Next day at noon some Turks
brought them back with the horses. The fugitives
had passed them the evening before, and becoming
suspicious, they had oucAioned them until they con-
fessed their design or escaping. We went on next
to Barghama which is in rums but has a Arong
fortress on the summit of a hill. Here we hired a
guide and travelled among high and rugged moun-
tains to the town of Balfkasrl. The sultan, whose
name is Dumdr Khdn, is a worthless person. It
was his father who built this town, and during the
son’s reign it attraAcd a vaA population of knaves,
for Like king, like people.” I visited him and he
>35



SELECTIONS FROM THE

sent me a silk robe. In this town I bought a Greek
slave girl called Marguerite.

We journeyed next to Bursd [Brusa], a great city
with fine bazaars and broad Greets, surrounded by
orchards and running springs. Outside it are two
thermal establishments, one for men and the other
for women, to which patients come from the moSl
distant parts. They lodge there for three days at
a hospice which was built by one of the Turkmen
kings. In this town I met the pious Shaykh ‘Abdullah
the Egyptian, a traveller, who went all round the
world, except that he never visited China, Ceylon,
the WeSt, or Spain or the Negrolands, so that in visit-
ing those countries I have surpassed him. The sultan
of Bursa is Orkhan Bek, son of ‘Othman Chfik. He
is the greatest of the Turkmen kings and the richeSl
in wealth, lands, and military forces, and possesses
nearly a hundred fortresses which he is continually
visiting for inspeftion and putting to rights. He
fights with the infidels and besieges them. It was
his father who captured Bursa from the Greeks, and
it is said that he besieged Yazni'k [Nicaea] for about
twenty years, but died before it was taken. His son
Orkhan besieged it twelve years before capturing it,
and it was there that I saw him.^® Yaznik lies in
a lake and can be reached only by one road like a
bridge admitting only a single horseman at a time.
It is in ruins and uninhabited except for a few men
in the Sultan’s service. It is defended by four walls
with a moat between each pair, and is entered over
wooden drawbridges. Inside there are orchards and
houses and fields, and drinking water is obtained from
wells. I ^ayed in this town forty days owing to the
illness of one of my horses, but growing impatient
at the delay I left it and went on with three of my
companions and a slave girl and two slave boys. W^e
had no one with us who could speak Turkish well

136



TRAVELS OF IHN B ATT OTA

enough to interpret for us, for the interpreter we had
left us at YazniL After leaving this town we crossed
a {»rcat river called Saoarf [Sangarius] by a ferp^.
This consiAcd of four Learns bound together with
ropes, on which the passengers arc placed, together
with their saddles and baggage; it is pulled across bv
men on the further bank, and the horses swim behind.
The same night we reached Kdwiya [Gheiva] and
lodged with one of the Brotherhood. As he neither
unoerrtood Arabic nor we Turkish, he sent for a
theologian, who spoke to us in Persian, and not
understanding us when we spoke Arabic, excused
himself to the brother saying hhdn *arabl kuhnd
*arahl fluto mlddnamy which means
“ These men speak ancient Arabic and I know only
modern Arabic." He said this only to shield himself
from disgrace, for they thought he knew Arabic, when
in realiw he did not know it. But this turned out
to be ot service to us, for the brother, thinking that
things were really as he had said, showed us the
greatedl consideration saying ** These men muil be
honourably treated, since they speak the ancient
Arabic tongue, which was the tongue of the Prophet
and his Companions." I did not understand ju£t
then what the theologian had said, but the sound of
his words ftuck in my memory and when I learned
the Persian language, I found out their meaning.

We spent that night at the hospice, and the Brother
sent a guide with us to Yanija [Tarakli], which is
a fine large town. We Parted to look for the akhi's
hospice, and found one of those crazy darwfshes, so
I said to him “ Is this the akhfs hospice ?” He
replied na'am [" Yes and I felt so pleased at having
found someone who knew Arabic. But when I
tciled him further the cat was out of the bag, for
na^am was the only word of Arabic he knew. We
put up at the hospice, and one of the Audents brought
*37



SELECTIONS FROM THE

food to us. The akhi himself was away, but we
became very friendly with this ^udent. Though he
knew no Arabic, he was very kind to us, and spoke
to the governor of the town, who gave me one of his
mounted men to take us to Kaynuk [Kevnik]. Kaynuk
is a small town in the territiries of Sultan Orkhan Bek,
inhabited by infidel [Christian] Greeks under Muslim
protedllon. There is only one household of Muslims
in the place, and that belongs to the governors of the
Greeks, so we put up at the house of an old infidel
woman. This was in the season of snow and rain.
She treated us well,^"^ and we spent that night in her
house. Now this town has no trees or vineyards; the
only thing cultivated there is saffron, and the old
woman brought us a great quantity of it, thinking
that we were merchants and would buy it from her.

When we mounted our horses in the morning, the
horseman whom the member of the Brotherhood had
sent with us from Kayndk came to us and provided
us with another horseman to guide us to the town of
Muturni. The road was obliterated by a heavy fall
of snow the previous night, so our guide went on
ahead of us and we followed his tracks. About mid-
day we came to a village of Turkmens, who brought
us food, of which we ate. The horsenjan spoke to
them and one of them went on with us. He led us
over difficult and mountainous country, and a river
channel which we crossed more than thirty times.
When we got clear of this the guide asked us for
some money, but we said “ When we reach the town
we shall give you plenty.” He was not satisfied or
else did not understand, for he took a bow belonging
to one of our party and went off a little way, then
returned and gave the bow back. I then gave him
a little money and he took it and decamped, leaving
us with no idea which way to go and with no road
visible to us. About sunset we came to a hill on

138



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

which we could make out the track by a quantity of
Clones on it. I was afraid that both I and my com-
panions might perish, as I expelled more snow to
fall and the place was uninhabited; if we dismounted
we were doomed and if we went on we did not know
the road. I had a good horse however, so I said to
myself “ If I reach safety perhaps I may contrive to
save my companions,” and commending them to God,
I set off. At length in the late evening I came to
some houses and said “ O God, grant they may be
inhabited.” I found that they were inhabited, and
God of his goodness led me to a religious house
belonging to some darwi'shes. When they heard me
speaking at the door, one of them came out; he was
a man whon; I knew, and I advised him to go out
with the darwfshes to deliver my companions. They
did so and set out with me, and so we all reached the
convent In safety, praise be to God Moft High for
our safety 1 Each darwfsh brought us what food he
could and our digress was removed.

We set out next morning and reached Muturnf
[Mudurlu], where we fell in with a pilgrim who knew
Arabic. We besought him to travel with us to
Qa^lamiiniya, which is ten days’ journey from there;
I gave him an Egyptian robe of mine and some money
for current expenses, which he left with his family,
and assigned him a mount, promising him a good
reward. He turned out to be a wealthy man, but of
base charafter. We used to give him money for our
expenses, and he would take the bread that was left
over and buy spices, herbs and salt with it, and appro-
priate the money for these. I was told too that he
used to ileal part of the money that we gave him for
our expenses. We put up with him because of our
difficulties in not knowing Turkish, but things went
so far that we used to say to him in the evenings
“ Well, Hajjf, how much have you ilolen today ?”

139



SELECTIONS FROM THE

He would reply “ So much ” and we would laugh and
make the be^ of it. We came next to the town of
Biali, where we ^ayed at a convent of the Young
Brotherhood. What an excellent body of men these
are, how nobleminded, how unselfish and full of
compassion for the Granger, how kindly and affec-
tionate they are to him, how warm their welcome to
him ! A Granger coming to them is made to feel
as though he were meeting the deare^ of his own
folk. Next morning we travelled on to Garadi Biilf,
a large and fine town situated on a plain, with spacious
Greets and bazaars, but one of the colde^ towns in
the world. It is composed of several different quarters,
each inhabited by different communities, none of
which mixes with any of the others. . The sultan,
who is one of the less important rulers in this country,
is a fine-looking and upright man, but not liberal.
He came to visit us at the religious house and ^ayed
for an hour, asking me about my travels, and after-
wards sent me a saddled horse and a robe.

We went on through a small town named Burlii^
to Qa^amdniya, a very large and fine town, in which
goods are plentiful, and prices cheaper than I have-
ever seen elsewhere. We ^ayed in the convent of
a very deaf shaykh and I saw an a^onishing thing in
connexion with him. One of his students used to
write with his finger in the air or on the ground and
he would underhand and reply. Sometimes long
Tories were told him in this way. We remained here
about forty days. The sultan of Qa^Iamfiniya is the
illu^rious Sulayman Padshah, a man over seventy
years of age with a fine face and long beard, a lately
and venerable figure. I visited him in his reception
hall and he made me sit beside him and asked me
about my travels. He then commanded me to be
lodged near him, and. gave me on the same day a fine
white horse and a robe, besides assigning me money

140



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

for my expenses and forage. Later on he gave me
an assignation of wheat and barley from a village
half a day’s journey from the town, but I could not
find anyone to buy it because of the cheapness of
provisions, so I gave it to the pilgrim who was in our
company. It is a cuflom of this sultan’s to take his
seat in the audience chamber every afternoon; food is
served and the doors arc opened and no one, whether
townsman or nomad, stranger or traveller, is prevented
from partaking.

From QaAamdniya we travelled to Sanub [Sinope],
a populous town combining ^rength with beauty. It
is surrounded by sea except on the ea5V, where there
is only one gate which no one is allowed to enter
without permission from the governor, Ibrahim Bek,
who is a son of Sulaymdn Pddshdh. Outside the town
there are eleven villages inhabited by Greek in6dcls.
The cathedral mosque at Sandb is a mo^ beautiful
building, conflruded by Sultan Parwdnah. He was
succeeded by his son Ghdzl Chelebi, at whose death
the town was seized by Sultan Sulaymdn. Ghdzi
Chelebf was a brave and audacious man, with a
peculiar capacity for swimming under water. He used
to sail out with his war vessels to fight the Greeks,
and when the fleets met and everyone was occupied
with the fighting he would dive under the water
carrying an iron tool with which he pierced the
enemy’s ships, and they knew nothing about it until
all at once they sank.

We flayed at Sandb about forty days waiting for
the weather to became favourable for sailing to the
town of Qiram.^® Then we hired a vessel belonging
to the Greeks and waited another eleven days for a
favourable wind. At length we set sail, but after
travelling for three nights, we were beset in mid-sea
by a terrible tempedl. The dlorm raged with un-
paralleled fury, then the wind changed and drove us
141



SELECTIONS FROM THE

back nearly to Sanub. The weather cleared and we
set out again, and after another temped like the
former, we at length saw the hills on the land. We
made for a harbour called Karsh [Kerch], intending
to enter it, but some people on the hill made signs
to us not to enter, and fearing that there were enemy
vessels in the port, we turned back along the coa^.
As we approached the land I said to the ma^er of the
ship “ I want to descend here,” so he put me ashore.
The place was in the Qipchaq desert which is green
and verdant, but flat and treeless. There is no fire-
wood so they make fires of dung, and you will see
even the higher* of them picking it up and putting
it in the skirts of their garments. The only method
of travelling in this desert is in waggons; it extends
for six months’ journey, of which three are in the
territories of Sultan Muhammad Uzbeg.^^ The day
after our arrival one of the merchants in our company
hired some waggons from the Qipchaqs who inhabit
this desert, and who are Chriftians, and we came to
Kafa, a large town extending along the sea-coaft,
inhabited by Chriftians, moftly Genoese, whose
governor is called Damdir [Demetrio].^®

We ftayed at Kafa in the mosque of the Muslims.
An hour after our arrival we heard bells ringing on
all sides. As I had never heard bells before,^® I was
alarmed and bade my companions ascend the minaret
and read the Koran and issue the call to prayer. They
did so, when suddenly a man entered wearing armour
and weapons and greeted us. He told us that he was
the qadi of the Muslims there, and said “ When I
heard the reading and the call to prayer, I feared for
your safety and came as you see.” Then he went
away, but no evil befel us. The next day the governor
came to us and entertained us to a meal, then we went
round the city and found it provided with fine bazaars.
All the inhabitants are infidels. W^e went down to

142



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

the port and saw a magniHcent harbour with about
two hundred vessels in it, ships of war and trading
vessels, small and large, for it is one of the mo^ notable
harbours in the world.

We hired a waggon and travelled to the town
of Qiram, which forms part of the territories of
Sultan Uzbeg Khdn and has a governor called Tuluk-
tumiir. On hearing of our arrival the governor sent
the imdm to me with a horse; he himself was ill, but
we visited him and he treated us honourably and gave
us gifts. He was on the point of setting out for the
town of Sard, the capital of the Khdn, so I prepared
to travel along with him and hired waggons for that
purpose. These waggons have four large wheels and
are drawn by two or more horses, or by oxen or camels,
according to their weight. The driver rides on one
of the horses and carries a whip or wooden goad.
On the waggon is put a light tent made of wooden
laths bound with dlrips of hide and covered with felt
or bIanket<loth, ana it has grilled windows so that
the person inside can see without being seen. One
can do anything one likes inside, sleep, eat, read or
write, during the march. The waggons conveying
the baggage and provisions are covered with a similar
tent which is locked.

We set out with the amir Tuluktumdr and his
brother and two sons. At every halt the Turks loose
their horses, oxen and camels, and drive them out to
pasture at liberty,^ night or day, without shepherds or
guardians. This is due to the severity of their laws
against theft. Any person found in possession of a
stolen horse is obliged to reilore it with nine others;
if he cannot do this, his sons are taken instead, and if
he has no sons he is slaughtered like a sheep. They
do not eat bread nor any solid food, but prepare a
soup with a kind of millet, and any meat they may
have is cut into small pieces and cooked in this soup.

Everyone is given his share in a plate with curdled
milk, and they drink it, afterwards drinking curdled
mare’s milk, which they call qumizz. They have also
a fermented drink prepared from the same grain,
which they [beer] and regard as lawful tp

drink. It is white in colour; I tabled it once and found
it bitter, so I left it alone. They regard the eating
of sweetmeats as a disgrace. One day during
Ramaddn I presented Sultan Uzbeg with a plate of
sweetmeats which one of my companions had made,
but he did no more than touch them with his finger
and then place it in his mouth.

Eighteen stations after leaving Qiram we came to
a great expanse of water which took us a whole day
to ford.^ The crossing becomes very muddy and
difficult when many bea^s and waggons have crossed,
so the amir, thinking of my comfort, sent me on ahead
with one of his suite and wrote a letter for me to the
governor of Azaq urging him to treat me honourably.
We crossed a second sheet of water, which required
half a day to ford, and on the third day from there,
reached Azaq [Azov], which is on the sea coa^. It
is a wellbuilt town, visited by the Genoese and other
merchants. The governor, on receiving the amir
Tuluktumdr’s letter, came out to meet me, along with
the qadi and the indents, and sent out food. After
greeting him, we dismounted and ate, then went on
to the town, outside which we camped. Two days
later the amir arrived, and was met with great cere-
mony. A banquet was prepared for him in a specially
prepared tent of coloured silk, and when he dismounted
pieces of silk were laid down for him to walk on.
Out of his generosity he made me precede him, in
order that the governor should see the high e^eem
in which he held me, and made me sit on a great
chair which had been placed for him, himself sitting
beside me, while his two sons and his brother and

144



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

nephews remained landing rcspe£lfully. After the
banquet was over a robe was presented to the amir
and to each member of hts family and to me, then the
amir and his brother were presented with ten horses,
his two sons with six, and 1 too with one.

The horses in this country arc very numerous and
the price of them is negligible. A good one coAs
about a dinar of our money. The livelihood of the
people depends on them, and they are as numerous
as sneep in our country, or even more so. A single
Turk will possess thousands of horses. They arc ex-
ported to India in droves of six thousand or so, each
merchant possessing one or two hundred of them or less
or more. For each fifty they hire a keeper, who looks
after their paAura^e. He rides on one of them, carry-
ing a long ^ick with a rope attached to it, and when
he wishes to catch any horse he gets opposite it on the
horse which he is riding, throws the rope over its
neck and draws it towards him, mounts it and sets
the other free to paAure. On reaching Sind the
horses are fed with forage, because the vegetation of
Sind will not take the place of barley, and the greater
part of them die or are Aolen. The owners pay a
duty of seven silver dinars on entering Sind and a
further duty at Multdn. Formerly they were taxed
a quarter of the value of their imports, but Sultan
Muhammad abolished this tax and ordered that
Muslim merchants should pay the legal tithc*^ and
infidel merchants a tenth. Nevertheless the mer-
chants make a handsome profit, for the leadl that a
horse fetches is a hundred dinars (that is twenty-five
dinars in Moroccan money) and it often sells for twice
or three times that amount. A good horse sells for
five hundred or more. The Indians do not buy them
as racehorses, for in battle they wear coats of mail
and cover their horses with armour; what they prize
in a horse is its dlrength and length of pace. Their

racehorses are brought from Yemen, "Oman and Fars,
and they coif from a thousand to four thousand dinars
each.

From Azaq I went on to Majar, travelling behind
the amir Tuluktumdr. It is one of the fine^ of the
Turkish cities, and is situated on a great river.^^ In
the bazaar of this city I met a Jew, who greeted me
in Arabic and told me that he had come from Spain.
He said that he had come overland, through Con-
stantinople the Great, Anatolia and the land of the
Circassians [Transcaucasia], and that the journey had
taken four months. The travelling merchants, who
know about these matters, assured me of the truth of
his Statement.

A remarkable thing which I saw in this country
was the respeSt shown to women by the Turks, for
they hold a more dignified position than the men.
The fir^ time that I saw a princess was when, on
leaving Qira'm, I saw the wife of the amir in her
waggon. The entire waggon was covered with rich
blue woollen cloth, and the windows and doors of the
tent were open. With the princess were four maidens,
exquisitely beautiful and richly dressed, and behind
her were a number of waggons with maidens belonging
to her suite. When she came near the amir’s camp
she alighted with about thirty of the maidens who
carried her train. On her garments there were loops,
of which each maiden took one, and lifted her train
clear of the ground on all sides, and she, walked in
this ^lately manner. When she reached the ami'r he
rose before her and greeted her and sat her beside
him, with the maidens standing round her. Skins of
qumizz were brought and she, pouring some into a
cup, knelt before him and gave it to him, afterwards
pouring out a cup for his brother. Then the amir
poured out a cup for her and food was brought in and
she ate with him. He then gave her a robe and she

146



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

withdrew. I saw also the wives of the merchants and
commonalty. One of them will sit in a waggon which
is being drawn by horses, attended by three or four
maidens to carry her train, and on her head she wears
a conical headdress incru^lcd with pearls and sur-
mounted by peacock feathers. The windows of the
tent are open and her face is visible, for the Turkish
women do not veil themselves. Sometimes a woman
will be accompanied by her husband and anyone
seeing him would take him for one of her servants;
he has no garment other than a sheep’s wool cloak
and a high cap to match.

We then prepared for the journey to the sultan’s
camp, which was four days* march from MAjar in a
place called Blshdagh, which means “ Five moun-
tains.”^ In these mountains there is a hot spring
in which the Turks bathe, claiming that it prevents
illness. We arrived at the camp on the firA day of
Ramaddn and found that it was moving to the neigh-
bourhood from which we had juR come, so we returned
thither. I set up my tent on a hill there, fixing a
standard in the grouna in front of it, and drew up the
horses and waggons behind. Thereupon the mahalla
approached (the name they give to it is the ordu)
and we saw a va^l town on the move with all its
inhabitants, containing mosques and bazaars, the
smoke from the kitchens rising in the air (for they
cook while on the march), and horse-drawn waggons
transporting them. On reaching the encampment
they took the tents off the waggons and set them upon
the ground, for they were very light, and they did
the same with the mosques and shops. The sultan *s
khdtdns passed by us, each separately with her own
retinue. The fourth of them, as she passed, saw the
tent on top of the hill with the ^andard in front of
it, which is the mark of a new arrival, and sent pages
and maidens to greet me and convey her salutations,

herself halting to wait for them. I sent her a gift
by one of my companions and the chamberlain of the
ami'r Tuluktumdr. She accepted it as a blessing and
gave orders that I should be taken under her pro-
te6lion, then went on. Afterwards the sultan arrived
and camped with his mahalla separately.

The illu^rious Sultan Muhammad Uzbeg Khan
is the ruler of a va^t kingdom and a mo^ powerful
sovereign, viftor over the enemies of God, the people
of Con^antinople the Great, and diligent in warring
again^ them. He is one of the seven mighty kings
of the world, to wit: our master the Commander of
the Faithful, may God strengthen his might and
magnify his vidtory ! [the sultan of Morocco], the
sultan of Egypt and Syria, the sultan of the Two
Traqs, this Sultan Czbeg, the sultan of TurkiStan
and the lands beyond the Oxus, the sultan of India,
and the sultan of China. The day after my arrival I
visited him in the afternoon at a ceremonial audience;
a great banquet was prepared and we broke our faSf in
his presence. These Turks do not follow the cuStom of
assigning a lodging to visitors and giving them money
for their expenses, but they send him sheep and horses
for slaughtering and skins of qumizz^ which is their
form of benefaftion. Every Friday, after the midday
prayer, the sultan holds an audience in a pavilion
called the Golden Pavilion, which is richly decorated.
In the centre there is a wooden throne covered with
silver-gilt plates, the legs being of pure silver set
with jewels at the top. The sultan sits on the throne,
having on his right the khatiin Taytughli with the
khatiin Kebek on her right, and on his left the khatun
Bayaliin with the khatdn XJrduja on her left. Below
the throne ^land the sultan’s sons, the elder on the
right and the younger on the left, and his daughter
sits in front of him. He rises to meet each khatdn
as she arrives and takes her by the hand until she

148



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

mounts to the throne. All this takes place in view
of the whole people, without any screening.

On the morrow of my interview with the sultan I
visited the principal khdtun Taytughlf, who is the
queen and the mother of the sultanas two sons. She
was sitting in the mid^ of ten aged women, who
appeared to be servants of hers, and had in front of
her about fifty young maidens with gold and silver
salvers filled with cherries which they were cleaning.
The khdtiin also had a golden tray filled with cherries
in front of her and was cleaning them. She ordered
qujnizz to be brought and with her own hand poured
out a cupful and gave it to me, which is the highedl
of honours in their edlimation. I had never drunk
qumizz before, but there was nothing for me but to
accept it. 1 tabled it, but found it disagreeable and
passed it on to one of my companions. The following
day we visited the second khdn^n Kebek and found
her sitting on a divan reading the holy Koran. She
also served me with qumizz. The third khitdn
Bayaldn is the daughter of the Emperor of Con-
ilantinople the Great.^ On visiting her we found
her sitting on a throne set with jewels, with about
a hundred maidens, Greek, Turkish and Nubian,
^landing or sitting in front of her. Behind her were
eunuchs and in front of her Greek chamberlains.
•She asked how we were and about our journey and
the di^ance of our native lands, and wept, in pity and
compassion, wiping her face with a handkerchief that
lay before her. She ordered food to be served and we
ate in her presence, and when we desired to leave she
said “ Do not sever relations with us, but come often
to us and inform us of your needs.” She showed
great kindness to us and after we had gone sent us
food, a great quantity of bread, butter, sheep, money,
a magnificent robe and thirteen horses, three good
ones and ten of the ordinary sort. It was with this
149



SELECTIONS FROM THE

khatiin that I made my journey to Constantinople
the Great, as we shall relate hereafter. The fourth
khatun is one of the beSl, moSt amiable and sympa-
thetic of princesses. We visited her and she showed
us a kindness and generosity that cannot be surpassed.
By the sultan’s daughter however we were treated
with a generosity and kindness that no other khatdn
showed us; she loaded us with surpassing favours,
may God reward her !

I had heard of the city of Bulghar^ and desired to
visit it, in order to see for myself what they tell of the
extreme shortness of the night there and also the
shortness of the day in the opposite season. It was
ten nights’ journey from the sultan’s camp, so I
requeued that he would give me a guide to take me
to it, and he did so. We reached it in the month
of Ramadan, and when we had breakfa^ed after the
sunset prayer we had juil sufficient time for the night
prayers before dawn. I ^ayed there three days. I
had intended to visit the Land of Darkness,^® which
is reached from Bulghar after a journey of forty days,
but I renounced the projeft in view of the difficulty
of the journey and the small profit to be got out of it.
The only way of reaching it is to travel on sledges
drawn by dogs, for the desert being covered with ice,
neither man nor bea^ can walk on it without slipping,
whereas the dogs have claws that grip the ice. The
journey is made only by rich merchants who have
a hundred sledges or thereabouts, loaded with food,
drink, and firewood, for there are neither trees, Clones
nor habitation in it. The guide in this country is the
dog which has made the journey many times, arid the
value of one of these reaches a thousand dinars. The
sledge is tied to its neck and three other dogs are
yoked with it; it is the leader, the other dogs following
it with the sledges, and where it ^ops they ftop.
Its owner never beats or chides it, and when food is

150



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

made the dogs arc served firR before the men; other-
wise the [leading] dog is angered and escapes, leaving
its owner to perish. When the travellers have com-
pleted forty Aages they alight at the Darkness. Each
one of them leaves the goods he has brought there
and they return to their usual camping-ground. Next
day they go back to seek their goods, and hnd opposite
them skins of sable, minever, and ermine. If the
merchant is satisfied with the exchange he takes them,
but if not he leaves them. The inhabitants then add
more skins, but sometimes they take away their goods
and leave the merchant's. This is their method of
commerce. Those who go there do not know whom
they arc trading with or whether they be jinn or men,
for they never see anyone.

I returned from Bulghdr with the amfr whom the
sultan had sent to accompany me, and found the
makalla at Bfshdagh on the 28th of Ramaddn, When
the ceremonies of the FcRIval [at the close of the month
of faRing] were over we set out with the sultan and
the makalla and came to the town of Hdjj Tarkhdn
[ARrakhan]. It is one of the fincdl of cities, with
great bazaars, and is built on the river Itil [Volga],
which is one of the great rivers of the world. In the
winter it freezes over and the people travel on it in
sledges; sometimes caravans cross it towards the end
of winter and are drowned. On reaching this town
the khdtdn Bayalun requeued the sultan to permit
her to visit her father, the king of the Greeks, that she
might give birth to her child at her home and return
again to him. He gave her permission and then I too
asked him to allow me to go in her company to see
ConRantinople the Great. He demurred, fearing for
my safety, but I said, “ I shall go under your patronage
and proteftion and I shall have nothing to fear from
anyone,” Thereupon he gave me permission and we
bade him farewell. He presented me with 1,500 dinars,



SELECTIONS FROM THE

a robe, and a large number of horses, and each khatdn
gave me ingots of silver. The sultan’s daughter gave
me more than they did, along with a robe and a horse,
so I found myself in possession of a considerable
quantity of horses, garments, and furs of sable and
minever.

We. set out on the tenth of Shawwal in the company
of the khatdn Bayaldn and under her protection. The
sultan escorted her one Clage, then returned, he and
the queen and the heir to the throne ; the other khatiins
accompanied her for a second Clage and then returned.
The amir Baydara with five thousand troops travelled
with her, and her own troops numbered about five
hundred horsemen, two hundred of whom were her
attendant slaves and Greeks, and the remainder Turks.
She had with her also about two hundred maidens,
moCt of whom were Greeks, and about four hundred
carts and about two thousand draught and riding
horses, as well as three hundred oxen and two hundred
camels. She had also ten Greek youths and the same
number of Indians, whose leader-in-chief was called
Sunbul the Indian; the leader of the Greeks was a
man of conspicuous bravery called Michael, but the
Turks gave him the name of Lu’lu’ [Pearl]. She left
mo^ of her maidens and her baggage at the sultan’s
camp, since she had set out only to pay a visit. We
made for Ukak,^ a medium-sized town, with fine
buildings, plentifully supplied with natural produCls,
and extremely cold. A day’s march from this town
are the mountains of the Russians. These are Chris-
tians, red-haired and blue-eyed, with ugly faces and
treacherous. In their country are silver mines and
thence are brought the ingots of silver with which
selling and buying is done in this land. The weight
of each of these ingots is five ounces.

After ten nights’ travelling from this town we
arrived at the town of Surdaq, which is on the sea

152



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

coail of the Qipchaq desert, and possesses one of the
bigge^ and fine^ of harbours.^ Outside it there are
orchards and springs, and it is inhabited by Turks
and a number of GrcelM under their dominion. These
Greeks are artisans and mo^ of their houses are made
of wood. This town was formerly a big one, but
mo^ of it was laid in ruins as the result of a quarrel
which broke out between the Greeks and the Turks,
At fir^ the Greeks had the upper hand, but the Turks
on receiving assiftance from their fellow-countrymen
killed the Greeks remorselessly and expelled moft of
them. Some of them ^ill remain there as subje(5ls
of the Turks. At every halting place in this land
the khduin received hospitality-gifts of horses, sheep,
cattle, millet, qumizZi and the milk of cows and sheep.
In these countries travelling is done in the forenoon
and in the evening. Every governor escorted the
khdtf^n with his troops right to the frontier of his
territories, to show her honour, not through fear for
her safety, for these lands are quite safe. We came
next to the town known by the name of Bdbd Saluiq,*®
who, they say, was an ecdlatic my^lic, though dlories
are told of a^ons by him which are condemned by
the law. This is the ladl town in Turkish territory.
From here to the beginning of Greek territory it
is a Journey of eighteen days through uninhabited
desert, for eight days of which there is no water, so
a dlock of water is laid in and carried in large and small
skins on the waggons. As it was in the cold weather
that we passed through we did not need much water,
and everything went well with us, praise be to God I
At the end of this march we reached the fortress of
Mahtiih', at the frontier of the territories of the Greeks.^®
The Greeks had heard that this khdtun was returning
to her country, and there came to this fortress to meet
her the Greek Kifdli®^ Nicolas, with a large army and
a large hospitality-gift, accompanied by the princesses

SELECTIONS FROM THE

and nurses from the palace of her father, the king
of Conflantinople. From MahtuH to Con^antinople
is a journey of twenty-two days, sixteen to the canal,
and six thence to Con^antinople. From this fortress
one travels on horses and mules only, and the waggons
are left behind there on account of the rough ground
and the mountains. Kifali had brought many mules,
six of which the khatiin sent to me. She also com-
mended to the care of the governor of the fortress
those of my companions and of my slaves whom I
had left behind with the waggons and baggage, and
he assigned them a house. The commander Baydara
returned with his troops, and none travelled on with
the khatun but her own people. She left her mosque
behind at the fort and the practice of calling to prayer
was abolished. As part of her hospitality-gifts she
was given intoxicating liquors, which she drank, and
swine, and I was told by one of her suite that she ate
them. No one remained with her who prayed except
one Turk, who used to pray with us. Sentiments
formerly hidden were revealed because of our entry
into the land of the infidels, but the khatdn charged
the amir Kifali to treat us honourably, and on one
occasion he beat one of his guards because he had
laughed at our prayer.

Thereafter we reached the fortress of Maslama ibn
‘Abd al-Malik, which is at the foot of a mountain
beside a swift-running river called Iffcafili. Nothing
is left of this fortress except its ruins, but outside it
is a large village. Thence we journeyed for two days
and reached the canal, on the bank of which there is
a large village. We found a rising tide on the canal
and waited till the ebb set in before fording it, its
breadth being about two miles. We then went four
miles through sand and reached the second canal, and
forded it, its breadth being about three miles. Then
we went about two miles through flones and sand

^54



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

and reached the third canal when the tide had begun
to rise, so we had some trouble to ford it, its breadth
being one mile. The breadth of the entire canal
therefore, counting both water channels and dry
Aretches, is twelve miles. In the rainy season it is
filled entirely with water and cannot be forded except
in boats. On the bank of this third canal is the town
of Fanika, small but beautiful and ilrongly fortified.
Its churches and houses are beautiful; it is .traversed
by Yearns and surrounded by orchards, and in it
grapes, pears, apples and quinces are preserved from
one year to the next. Wc flayed in this town three
nights, the khdtun being lodged in one of her father’s
caiUes there.

Then her i3rother, whose name was Kifdll Qards,
arrived with five thousand hotscmcrii fully accoutred
in armour. When they prepared to meet the princess,
her^ brother, dressed in white, rode a grey horse,
having over his head a parasol ornamented with jewels.
On his right hand he had five princes and the same
number on his left hand, all dressed in white also, and
with parasols embroidered in gold over their heads.
In front of him were a hundred foot soldiers and a
hundred horsemen, who wore long coats of mail over
themselves and their horses, each one of them leading
a saddled and armoured horse carrying the arms of
a horseman, consisting of a jewelled helmet, a breaSt-
plate, a bow, and a sword, and each man had in his
hand a lance with a pennant at its head. MoSl of
these lances were covered with plaques of gold and
Sliver. These led horses are the riding horses of
the sultan’s son. His horsemen were divided into
squadrons, two hundred horsemen in each squadron.
Over them was a commander, who had in front of
him ten of the horsemen, fully accoutred in armour,
each leading a horse, and behind him ten coloured
standards, carried by ten of the horsemen, and ten

155



SELECTIONS FROM THE

kettledrums slung over the shoulders of ten of the
horsemen, with whom were six others sounding
trumpets and bugles and fifes. The khatdn rode
out with her guards, maidens, slave boys and servants,
these numbering about five hundred, all wearing
silken garments, embroidered with gold and encru^ed
with precious ^ones. She herself was wearing a
garment of gold brocade, encru^ed with jewels, with
a crown .set with precious ^ones on her head, and her
horse was covered with a saddle-cloth of silk em-
broidered in gold. On its legs were bracelets of gold
and round its neck necklaces set with precious atones,
and her saddle frame was covered with gold orna-
mented with jewels. Their meeting took place in a
flat piece of ground about a mile di^ant from the
town. Her brother dismounted to her, because he
was younger than her, and kissed her ^irrup and she
kissed his head. The commanders and princes also
dismounted and they all kissed her ^irrup, after
which she set out with her brother.

On the next day we reached a large city on the sea-
coa^l, whose name I have forgotten, well furnished
with breams and trees, and encamped in its outskirts.
The heir to the throne, the brother of the khdtfin,
arrived with a great array and a ^rong army of ten
thousand mailed horsemen. He wore a crown on his
head, and had at his right hand about twenty princes
and a similar number on his left. His horsemen
were arranged exaftly as his brother’s, but with greater
pomp and larger numbers. His si^er met him in
a dress similar to the one she wore on the former
occasion, and both dismounted together. A silken
tent was brought and they both went into it, so I do
not know how they greeted each other. We encamped
at a di^ance of ten miles from Con^antinople, and on
the following day the population, men, women and
children, came out riding or on foot, in their riche^

156



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

apparel. At dawn the drums, trumpets and fifes
were sounded; the troops mounted, and the Emperor
with his wife, the mother of this khdtdn, came out,
accompanied by the high officials of Aatc and the
courtiers. Over the king’s head there was a canopy,
carried by a number of horsemen and men on foot,
who had in their hands long Slaves, each surmounted
by something resembling a oall of leather, with which
they hoifted the canopy. In the centre of this canopy
was a sort of pavilion which was supported by horse-
men on Slaves. When the Emperor approached, the
troops became entangled with one another and there
was much duA. I was unable to make my way
amongdl them, so I kept with the khdtdn’s baggage
and party, fearing for my life. I was told that when
the princess approached her parents she dismounted
and kissed the ground before them, and then kissed
the two hoofs of their horses, the principal members
of her party doing the same.

Our entry into Constantinople the Great was made
about noon or a little later, and they rang their bells
undl the very skies shook with the mingling of their
sounds. When we reached the fir^l gate of the king’s
palace we found there about a hundred men, with an
ofiiceron a,pIatform, and I heard them saying Sarakinu,
SarakinUf which means Muslims. They would not
let us enter, and when those who were with the khdtdn
said that we belonged to their party, they answered
“ They cannot enter except by permission,” so we
flayed at the gate. One of the khdtdn’s party sent
a messenger to tell her of this while she was dlill with
her father. 'She told him about us and he gave orders
that we should enter, and assigned us a house near
the khdtdn’s house. He wrote also on our behalf
an order that we should not be ob^lrufted wheresoever
we went in the city, and this order was proclaimed
in the bazaars. We dlayed indoors three days, re-

ceiving from the khatiin gifts of flour, bread, sheep,
chickens, butter, fruit, fish, money and beds, and on
the fourth day we had audience of the sultan.

The Emperor of Con^antinople is called Takfdr,
son of the Emperor Jirjis [George].®^ His father,
the Emperor George, was ^ill alive, but had become
an ascetic and monk, devoting himself to religious
exercises in the churches, and had resigned the sove-
reignty to his son. We shall speak of him later. On
the fourth day after our arrival in Con^antinople, the
khatiin sent the slave Sunbul the Indian to me, and
he took my hand and led me into the palace. We
passed through four gateways, each of which had
archways in which were footsoldiers with their
weapons, their officer being on a carpeted platform.
When we reached the fifth gateway the slave Sunbul
left me, and going inside returned with four Greek
youths, who searched me to see that I had no knife
on my person. The officer said to me: “ This, is a
cu^lom of theirs ; every person who enters the king's
presence, be he noble or private citizen, foreigner
or native, mu^ be searched.” The same pradiice is
observed also in India. After they had searched me
the man in charge of the gate rose and took me by
the hand and opened the gate. Four of the men sur-
rounded me, two of them holding my sleeves and two
behind me, and brought me into a large hall, the walls
of which were of mosaic work, in which there were
pi6lures of creatures, both animate and inanimate.
In the centre there was a ^ream of water, with trees
on either side of it, and men were ^landing to right
and left, silent, not one of them speaking. In the
midil of the hall three men were landing, to whom
those four men delivered me. These took hold of
my garments as the others had done, and on a signal
from another man led me forward.^® One of them
was a Jew, and he said to me in Arabic “ Do not be

158



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

afraid; this is their cuflom that they use with one who
enters. I am the interpreter, and I come from Syria.”
So 1 asked him how 1 should salute the Emperor and he
told me to say Ai~iaUm alaykum» After this I reached
a great pavilion, where the Emperor was seated on
his throne, with his wife, the mother of the khdidn,
before him. At the foot of the throne were the khdtdn
and her brothers, to the right of it six men and to the
left of it four, and behind it four, every one of them
armed. The Emperor signed to me, before I had
saluted and reached him, to sit down for a moment,
in order that my apprehension might be calmed.
After doing so I approached him and saluted him, and
he signed to me to sit down, but I did not do so. He
quedlioncd me about Jerusalem, the Sacred Rock, the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the cradle of Jesus,
and .Bethlehem, and aoout the cit)^ of Abraham
[Hebron], then about Damascus, Cairo, Trdq, and
Anatolia, and I answered all his que^ions about these,
the Jew interpreting between us. He was pleased
with my replies and said to his sons ” Treat this man
with honour and ensure his safety.” Then he bellowed
upon me a robe of honour and assigned me a horse
with saddle and bridle, and an umbrella of the kind
which the king has carried above his head, that being
a sign of proteftion. I requeued him to designate
someone to ride in the city with me every day, that I
might see its -marvellous and rare sights and tell of
them in my own country, and he appointed a man as I
had asked. They have a cuitom that anyone who wears
the king’s robe ot honour and rides his horse is paraded
round with trumpets, fifes and drums, so that the
^ople may see him. They do this mo^ly with the
Turks who come from the territories of Sultan Dzbeg,
so that the people may not mole^l them, and I was
paraded in this fashion through the bazaars.

The city is enormous in size, and in two parts

159



SELECTIONS FROM THE

separated by a great river [the Golden Horn], in
which there is a rising and ebbing tide. In former
times there was a ^one bridge over it, but it fell into
ruins and the crossing is now made in boats. The
part of the city on the ea^ern bank of the river is
called I^ambdl, and contains the residence of the
Emperor, the nobles and the re^l of the population.
Its bazaars and Greets are spacious and paved with
flagstones; each bazaar has gates which are closed
upon it at night, and the majority of the artisans and
sellers in them are women. The city lies at the foot
of a hill which projefts about nine miles into the sea,
its breadth being the same or greater. On the top
of the hill there is a small citadel and the Emperor’s
palace. Round this hill runs the city-wall, which is
very Strong and cannot be taken by assault from the
sea front. Within its circuit there are about thirteen
inhabited villages. The principal church is in the
midst of this part of the city. The second part, on
the western bank of the river, is called Galata, and is
reserved to the Frankish Chri^ians who dwell there.
They are of different kinds, including Genoese,
Venetians, Romans and people of France; they are
subjeSl: to the authority of the king of Constantinople,
who sets over them one of their own number of whom
they approve, and him they call the Comes. They
are bound to pay a tax every year to the king of Con-
stantinople, but often they revolt againSt him and he
makes war on them until the Pope makes peace
between them. They are all men of commerce and
their harbour is one of the larged in the world; I saw
there about a hundred galleys and other large ships,
and the small ships were too many to be counted.
The bazaars in this part of the town are good but
filthy, and a small and very dirty river runs through
them. Their churches too are filthy and mean.

Of the great church I can only describe the exterior,

for 1 did not sec its interior. It is called by them
Ayi Sdityi [St. Sophia]i and the ^ory goes that it
was built by Asaph, the son of Berechiah, who was
Solomon's cousin. It is one of the greatei^ churches
of the Greeks, and is encircled by a wall so that it
looks as if it were a (own. U has thirteen gates and
a sacred enclosure, which is about a mile long and
closed by a great gate. No one is prevented from
entering this enclosure, and indeed I went into it
with the king's father; it resembles an audience-hall
paved with marble, and is traversed by a Aream which
issues from the church. Outside the gate of this
hall arc platforms and shops, moHly of wood, where
their judges and the recorders of their bureaux sit.
At the gate of the church there arc porticoes where
the keepers sit who sweep its paths, light its lamps
and dose Its gates. They allow none to enter it until
he proilrates himself to the huge cross there, which
they claim to be a rcHc of the wood upon which the
pseudo-Jesus was crucified.** This is over the gate
of the church, set in a golden ease whose height is
about ten cubits, across which a similar golden case
is placed to form a cross. This gale is covered with
plaques of silver and gold and its two rings arc of
pure gold. 1 was told that the number of monks and
pricAs in this church runs into thousands, and that
some of them arc descendants of the apo^llcs, and
that inside it is another church exclusively for women,
containing more than a thousand virgins and a ^ill
greater number of aged women who devote them-
selves to religious pradiccs. It is the custom of the
king, the nobles and the reft of the people to come
every morning to visit this church. The Pope comes
to visit it once a year. When he is four days* journey
from the town the king goes out to meet him, and
dismounts before him and when he enters the ci^
walks on foot in front of him. During his ftay in

A monastery is the ChriSlian equivalent of a religious
house or convent among the Muslims, and there are
a great many such mona^eries at Con^antinople.
Among them is the mona^ery which King George
built outside I^ambul and opposite Galata, and two
mona^eries outside the principal church, to the right
as one enters it. These two monasteries are inside
a garden traversed by a ^ream of water; one of them
is for men and the other for women. In each there
is a church and they are surrounded by the cells of
men and women who have devoted themselves to
religious exercises. Each monastery possesses pious
endowments for the clothing and maintenance of the
devotees. Inside every monastery there is a small
convent designed for the ascetic retreat of the king
who built it, for moSt of these kings, on reaching the
age of sixty or seventy, build a monailery and put
on garments of hair, inve^ing their sons with the
sovereignty and occupying themselves with religious
exercises for the re^ of their lives. They display
great magnificence in building these mona^eries, and
con^lruft them of marble and mosaic-work. I entered
a monastery with the Greek whom the king had given
me as a guide. Inside it was a church containing
about five hundred virgins wearing hair-garments;
their heads were shaved and covered with felt bonnets.
They were exceedingly beautiful and showed the traces
of their au^erities. A youth sitting on a pulpit was
reading the gospel to them in the mo^ beautiful
voice I have ever heard; round him were eight other
youths on pulpits with their prie^, and when the fir^
youth had finished reading another began. The
Greek said to me “ These girls are kings’ daughters
who have given themselves to the service of this church,
and likewise the boys who are reading fare kings’

sons].” I entered with him also into churches in
which there were the daughters of minivers, governors,
and the principal men of the city, and others where there
were aged women and widows, and others where there
were monks, each church containing a hundred men
or so. Mo^ of the population of the city are monks,
ascetics, and prices, and its churches are not to be
counted for multitude.^ The inhabitants of the city,
soldiers and civilians, small and great, carry over their
heads huge parasols, both in winter and summer, and
the women wear large turbans.

I was out one day with my Greek guide, when we
met the former king George who had become a monk.
He was walking on foot, wearing haircloth garments
and a bonnet of felt, and he had a long white beard
and a fine face, which bore traces of his aufterities.
Behind and before him was a body of monks, and he
had a AafF in his hand and a rosary on his neck. When
the Greek saw him he dismounted and said to me
** Dismount, for this is the king’s father.” When my
guide saluted him the king asked him about me, then
topped and sent for me; He took my hand and said
to the Greek (who knew the Arabic tongue) “Say
to this Saracen (meaning Muslim) * I clasp the hand
which has entered Jerusalem and the foot which has
walked within the Dome of the Rock and the great
church of the Holy Sepulchre and Bethlehem,* ” and
he laid his hand upon my feet and passed it over his
face. 1 was ailonished at their good opinion of one
who, though not of their religion, had entered these
places. Then he took my hand and as I walked
with him asked me about Jerusalem and the Chrillians
who were there, and questioned me at length. I
entered with him the sacred enclosure of the church
which we have described above. When he approached
the principal gate, a party of priefts and monks came
out to salute him, for he is one of their chief men in
163



SELECTIONS FROM THE

mona^icism, and on seeing them he let go my hand.
I said to him “ I should like to enter the church with
you.” Then he said to the interpreter, “ Say to him
‘ He who enters it mu^h needs prostrate himself before
the great cross, for this is a rule which the ancients
laid down and which cannot be contravened.’ ” ' So I
left him and he entered alone and I did not see him
again. After leaving the king I entered the bazaar
of the scribes, where I was noticed by the judge, who
sent one of his assi^ants to ask the Greek about me.
On learning that I was a Muslim sciiolar he sent for
me and I went up to him. He was an old man with
a fine face and hair, wearing the black garments of
a monk, and had about ten scribes in front of hirn
writing. He rose to meet me, his companions rising
also, and said “ You are the king’s gue^ and we are
bound to honour you.” He then asked me about
Jerusalem, Syria, and Egypt, and spoke with me for
a . long time. A great crowd gathered round him,
and he said “ You mu^ come to my house that I may
entertain you.” After that I went away, but I did not
see him again.

When it became clear to the Turks who were in
the khatfin’s company that she professed her father’s
religion and wished to ^ay with him, they asked her
for leave to return to their country. She made them
rich presents and sent them an amir called Sariija
with five hundred horsemen to escort them to their
country. She sent for me, and gave me three hundred
of their gold dinars, called barhara.^ which are not
good money,^® and a thousand Venetian silver pieces,
together with some robes and pieces of cloth and two
horses, which were a gift from her father, and com-
mended me to Sarfija. I bade her farewell and left,
having spent a month and six days in their town. On
reaching the frontier, where we had left our party

the desert. San^ja came with us to B&bd Saltiaq,
where he Aayed as a gucR for three days, and then
went back to his lanu. This w^as in the depths of
winter and I used to wear three fur coats and two
pairs of trousers, one lined, and on my feet 1 had
woollen bools, with a pair of linendined boots on top
of these and a pair of horse skin boots lined with
bearskin on top of these again. I performed my
ablutions with not water close to the fire, but every
drop of water froac on the infant. When I washed
my face the water ran down my beard and froze, and
when I shook it oft it was a sort of snow that fell from
it. Water dripping from the nose froze on the
mouAachc. I was unable to mount my horse for the
quantity of clothes I was wearing and my companions
had to help me into the saddle.

On reaching Hdji Tarkhdn [AArakhan], where we
had parted from Sultan Ozbeg, we found that he had
moved and was living In the capital of his kingdom.
We travelled on the river Itil [Volga] and the neigh-
bouring waters, which were frozen over, and used to
break a piece of the ice whenever we needed water,
and put It in a cauldron till it melted, when we used
it for drinking and cooking. On the fourth day we
reached the city of Sard, which is the capital of the
sultan.*’ We visited him, and after we had answered
his qucdlions about our journey and the king of the
Greeks and his city he gave orders for our maintenance
and lodging. Sard is one of the fincdl of towns, of
immense extent and crammed with inhabitants, with
fine bazaars and wide directs. We rode out one day
with one of the principal men of the town, intending
to make a circuit of the place and find out its size.
We were living at one end of it and we set out in the
morning, and it was after midday when we reached
the other. One day we walked across the breadth of
the town, and the double journey, going and returning,

from the capital by a desert extending for forty days'
inarch. It U Impassable for horses on account of
the scarcity of fodder and the waggons arc drawn
only bv camels. Ten days after leaving Sar.i we
reached SarichOk, which means ** Little Sari,** a town
on the bank of a great and swift-dowing river called
UIdsd [Ural]/ which is crossed by a bridge of boats
like the bridge at Ihghdid. Here we hired camels
to take the place of the horses that had drawn our
vraggon hitherto, and sold the horses at the rate of
four silver dinars per head or leas, on account of their
exhauAson and (he cheapness of horses in this town.
From this point we nude a rapid march for thirty
days, halting only for two hours each day, one in the
forenoon and one at sunset, to cook and drink millet
broth. They hxvc with (hem dried preserved meat
which they put on top of (his, and pour sour milk
over the whole. Each person cats and sleeps in his
waggon while it is on the move. Travellers make
this journey with the utmoA speed, because of the
scarcity of herbage. The greater number of camels
which cross the desert perish and the remainder arc
of no use until the following year, when they are
fattened up again. Water is obtained from rain-pools
or shallow wells at known points separated by two or
three days' march.

After crossing this desert we reached Khwdrizm,
which is the largcA, grcatcA, moA beautiful and moA
important city of the Turks.* It shakes under the
weight of its population, whose movements lend it

the semblance of a billowy sea. One day as I was
riding in the bazaar I became ^luck in the crowd,
unable to go either forward or backward. I did not
know what to do and only with great difficulty made
my way back. The city is in the dominions of Sultan
Uzbeg, who is represented by a powerful amir called
Qutlddumdr. I have never seen anywhere in the
world more excellent people than the Khwarizmians,
or more generous or more friendly to strangers. They
have a praiseworthy cu^om in regard to the prayer-
services which I have not seen elsewhere. Each
muezzin goes round the houses adjoining his mosque
warning them to attend the service, and any person
who absents himself from the communal prayers is
beaten by the qddi in the presence of the people.
In each mosque there is a whip hung up for this
purpose. The culprit is fined in addition five dinars,
which are spent on the purposes of tl\e mosque or in
charity. They say that this cu^om is one which they
have had from ancient times. Outside the city flows
the river Jayhfin [Oxus], one of the four rivers of
Paradise, which freezes over for five months in the
cold season like the Itil [Volga]. In' the summer it
is navigable for ships as far as Tirmidh [Termez],
the journey down stream taking ten days. On reach-
ing Khwarizm I encamped in the outskirts, and the
qadi, being informed of my arrival, came out to greet
me with a company of his followers. When we met
he said to me “ This town is densely populated, and
you will have difficulty in entering it in the daytime,
so my assi^ant will come to conduft you in towards
the end of the night.” We followed this sugge^ion
and were lodged in a new academy, in which no one
was living as yet. After the Friday service I went
with the qadi to his house, which was near the mosque,
and was taken into a magnificent apartment. It was
furnished with rich carpets and the walls were hung

with dotht and In it there were a number of niches
each containing veucls of silvcr'gilt and 'Iriqt gloss.
This is 0 cuAom followed by the people of this country.

1 went with the qidt also to visit the amir Qut-
iudumtlr and found him reclining on a silk carpet
with his feel covered, as he was suffering from gout,
a malady very common among the lurks. Ife
qucAioned me about his sovereign, and the kh.itun
Bapliin and her father and the city of Conflantinoplc.
Then tables were brought in with roasted fowls,
cranes, young pigeons, bread baked with butter,
biscuits, and sweetmeats, which were followed by
other tables with fruit, pomcgrimtes prcpired for the
table, some of them served sn vessels of gold and silver
with golden spoons, and others in vessels of glass with
wooden spoons,* and wonderful melons. On our
return to the academy, the amir sent us rice, Hour,
sheep, butter, spices and loads of wood. The use of
charcoal is unknown in all these countries, as also in
India and Persia. In China they make fires with
Aoncs which burn like charcoal, and when they arc
burned to ashes they knead these with w-atcr, dry them
in the sun, and use them for cooking a^ain until they
are entirely consumed. One of the habits of the amir
is this. Every day (he qidl goes to his audicncc<hali
with his jurisconsults and senbes and sits on a chair
placed for him, opposite one of the principal amirs,
who is attended by eight other great amirs and shaykhs
of the Turks. ITic inhabiunu bring up their eases
for trial, and those which come under the sacred Law
arc decided by the qidi, and the others by these amirs.
Their judgments arc sound and equitable, because
they arc free from suspicion of partiality and do not
accept bribes. One Eriday, alter the service, the
qidi said to me “ The amir gave inflruftions that you
should be given five hundred dirhams and that for
another five hundred dirhams a banquet should be

prepared in your honour, to which the shaykhs,
doftors and principal men were to be invited. I said
to him ‘ You are preparing a banquet at which the
gue^s will only eat one or two mouthfuls. If you
were to give him all the money it would be more
useful to him.’ He said that he would do so and has
ordered the full thousand to be given to .you.” I
received the-sum (which is equivalent to three hundred
Moroccan dinars) in a purse borne by a page. The
same day I had bought a black horse for thirty-five
silver dinars and ridden it to the mosque, and it was
out of that thousand and no other that I paid its price.
Thereafter I became possessed of so many horses
that I dare not mention their number le^ some sceptic
may accuse me of lying, and things continued to go
better with me all the time until I reached India. I
had many horses, but I preferred this black horse and
picketed it in front of all the others. It remained
with me for three years, and when it died my affairs
took a turn for the worse.

On my journey to Khwarizm I had been accom-
panied by a merchant from Karbala, a sharff called
‘All. I commissioned him to buy me some garments
and other things, and he bought me a robe for ten
dinars, but charged up only eight dinars against me
and paid the other two out of his own pocket. I was
in total ignorance of what he had done until it came
to my ears in a roundabout way. Not only that, but
he had lent me some money and when I received the
amir’s gift and repaid him what I owed, I wished to
inake him a present over and above in return for his
kindnesses, but he refused it and refused also my
sugge^ion to present it to a slave boy of his. He was
the mo^ open-handed ‘Iraqi whom I have ever met.
He decided to travel with me to India, but afterwards
a party from his native town arrived at Khwdrizm on
their way to China, and fearing le^l they should accuse

170

him to his fellow-townsmen of going to India to beg,
he set out with them. I heard later on, when 1 was
in India, that when he reached Almaliq, which is on
the frontiers of Turki^lin and China,* he flayed there
and sent a slave boy on with all his goods. The slave
boy was a long time in returning and meanwhile a
merchant from his native town arrived and put up
with him in the same caravanseray. The sharif asked
him to lend him some money until his boy should
arrive, but the merchant would not do so, and, not
content with his vile condu^f in failing to succour
the sharif, he tried to put up the ^cc of his lodging
in the caravanseray against him. The sharif heard of
this, and was so tmset that he went into his room and
cut his throat. He was found with a spark of life
ilill in him; they suspefted a slave whom he had of
murdering him, but he said to them “ Do not wrong
him, it was I who did this to myself,” and expired the
same day — may God forgive him I
When I made ready to leave Khwdrizm I hired
camels and bought a camel-litter. The servants rode
some of the horses and we put rugs on the re^l because
of the cold. We entered the desert which is between
KhwArizm and Bukhdrd, an eighteen days’ journey
through sands, with no settlements on the way except
the small town of Kdt,® which we reached after four
days’ march. We encamped outside it, by a lake
which was frozen over and on which the boys were
playing and sliding. The qddi came out to greet us,
followed an hour later by the governor and his suite,
who pressed us to ^lay and gave a banquet in our
honour. In this desert there is a journey of six nights
without water, after which we reached the town of
Wabkana [Wafkend], Thence we travelled for a
whole day through a continuous series of orchards,
breams, trees and buildings, and reached the city of
Bukhdrd. This city was formerly the capital of the

171

lands beyond the Oxus. It was de^royed by the
accursed Tinki'z [Chingiz] the Tatar, the ance^or of
the kings of ‘Iraq, and all but a few of its mosques,
academies, and bazaars are now lying in ruins. Its
inhabitants are looked down upon and their evidence
[in legal cases] is not accepted in Khwdrizm and else^-
where, because of their reputation for fanaticism,
falsehood and denial of the truth. There is not one
of its inhabitants today who possesses any theological
learning or makes any attempt to acquire it.® We
lodged at a hospice in a suburb of Bukhara called
Fath Abad. The shaykh entertained me at his house
and invited the principal men of the town. We
spent a mo^ delightful night there; the Koran-readers
recited in pleasing voices, and the preacher delivered
an address, and then they sang melodiously in Turkish
and Persian.

From Bukhara we set out for the camp of the pious
Sultan Tarmashinn, and passed by Nakhshab [Qarshi],
a small city surrounded by gardens and water channels.
On the following afternoon we reached the sultan’s
camp. A merchant lent us a tent in which we spent
the night, and next day, as the sultan was away hunt-
ing, I visited his representative, the ami'r Taqbugha,
who lodged me near his mosque and gave me a Turkish
tent of the kind we have already described. That
night one of my slave girls gave birth to a child. I
was told at fir^ that it was a boy but afterwards I
found out that it was a girl. She was born under a
lucky ^ar, and from that time on I experienced
everything to give me joy and satisfa6lion. She died
^o months after my arrival in India, as will be related
in the sequel.

The Sultan of Turki^an, Tarmashin'n, is a powerful
sovereign, possessing a large army and a vaft kingdom,
and upright in his government. His territories lie
between four of the great kings of the world, the kings

172



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

of China, India, and ‘Irdq and King Uzbeg, all of
whom send him gifts and show him honour/ His
two brothers who preceded him were both infidels.
One day, after I had prayed the dawn-prayer in the
mosque, according to my cuflom, I was told that the
sultan was present. When he rose from his prayer-
carpet I went forward to salute him and he welcomed
me in Turkish. As he returned on foot to his audience
hall the people came forward to him with their com-
plaints and he topped to li^en to each petitioner,
small. or great, male or female. Thereafter he sent
for me, and I found him in a tent seated on a chair
covered with gold-embroidered silk. The tent was
lined with silken cloth of gold, and a crown, set with
jewels and precious ftones, was suspended over the
sultan’s head at a cubit’s height. The principal amirs
were sitting on chairs to right and left of him and in
front of him were princes holding fly-whisks. He
interrogated me about my journeys, his chancellor
ailing as interpreter. We used to attend the prayer-
services with him (this was during a period of intense
and perishing cold weather) and he never failed to
attend the dawn and evening prayers with the con-
gregation. One day when I was present at the after-
noon prayer, one of his pages came in with a prayer-
mat and spread it in the place where the sultan usually
prayed, saying to the imdm ** Our mafler desires you
to delay the prayer for a moment while he performs
his ablutions.” The imdm said in Persian “ Is prayer
for God or Tarmashlrln ?” and ordered the muezzin
to recite the second call. The sultan arrived when
the service was half over, and made the remaining
two proflrations at the end of the ranks, in the place
where the shoes are left near the door of the mosque.
He then performed the proflrations that he had missed,
and went up laughing to the imdm to shake his hand,
and sitting down in his place said to me “ When you

173



SELECTIONS FROM THE

return to your country tell how a Persian mendicant
a6led thus with the sultan of the Turks.”, This shaykh
used to preach every Friday, exhorting the sultan to
a^l righteously and forbidding him in the harshe^
terms to a.6t corruptly and tyrannically, and the sultan
would sit silent before him and weep. He would
never accept gifts from the sultan nor eat at his table,
nor wear the robes presented to him; he was a virtuous
servant of God.

When I decided to continue my journey after a
^ay of fifty-four days with the sultan, he gave me
seven hundred silver dinars and a sable coat worth a
hundred dinars, which I had asked of him on account
of the cold, as well as two horses and two camels.
After taking leave of him I journeyed to Samarqand,
which is one of the larged and mo^ perfedlly beautiful
cities in the world. It is built on the bank of a river
where the inhabitants promenade after the afternoon
prayer. There were formerly great palaces along the
bank, but mo^ of them are in ruins, as also is much
of the city itself, and it has no walls or gates. Outside
the city is the grave of Qutham ibn al-‘ Abbas, who
met a martyr’s death at the conque^ of Samarqand.®
The inhabitants go out to visit it every Sunday and
Thursday night and the Tatars also visit it, bringing
large votive offerings of cattle, sheep and money,
which are used for the maintenance of travellers and
of the guardians of the hospice.

We set out from Samarqand and reached Tirmidh
[Termez], a large town with fine buildings and bazaars
and traversed by canals. It abounds in grapes and
quinces of an exquisite flavour, as well as in flesh-
meats and milk. The inhabitants wash their heads
in the bath with milk instead of fuller’s earth; the
proprietor of every bath-house has large jars filled
with milk, and each man as he enters takes a cupful
to wash his head. It makes the hair fresh and glossy.

The Indians put oU of sesame on their heads and after-
wards wash their hair with fuller’s earth. This
refreshes the body and makes the hair glossy and
long) and that is the reason why the Indians and those
who live in their country have long beards. The old
town of Tirmldh was built on the bank of the Oxus,
and when it was laid in ruins b^ Tinklz [Chingiz]
this new town was built two miles from the river.
Before reaching the city I fell in with its governor
'Ali al-MuIk Khuddwand Zddah> who sent on an
order for our entertainment as gucils, and provisions
were brought to us every day during our ^lay
there.

We crossed the river Oxus into the land of Khurdsln
and after a day and a halPs march through a sandy
uninhabited w^e reached Balkh. It is an utter ruin
ud uninhabited, but anyone seeing it would think
it inhabited on account of the solidity of its conftruc-
tion. The accursed Tinklz dcdlroyed this city and
demolished about a third of its mosque on account of
a treasure which he was told lay under one of its
columns. He pulled down a third of them and found
nothing and left the rc^ as it was. After leaving
Bdkh we travelled for seven days through the moun-
tains of Qiihi^Idn, in which there arc numerous in-
habited villages with running streams and leafy trees,
moAly fig-trees, and many hospices inhabited by
devotees. Thereafter we reached the city of Herdt,
which is the larged^ inhabited city in Khurdsdn. There
are four large cities in this province, two of them,
Herdt and Naysdbiir [Nfshdpdr] inhabited, and two,
Balkh and Merv, in mins.

The sultan of Herdt is the illustrious Husayn, son
of the sultan Ghiydth ad-Dln al-Ghiirl, a man of
notorious bravery and viftorious by the Divine Favour
on two fields of battle.® A pious ascetic of great
merit, called Nizdm ad-Dfn Mawldna, spent his youth

at Herat. He was beloved by the people, who would
come to hear his sermons and exhortations, and who
made a compa<5l with him to repress evildoing. The
preacher Malik Warna, who was a cousin of the
king’s, was also a party to this compadt. Whenever
they learned of any evil adfion, even on the part of
the king, they took means to repress it. It is said
that they found out one day that an unlawful adl was
being committed in King Husayn’s palace, and they
assembled to put a dtop to it. The king fortified
himself again^ them within the palace, but they
assembled to the number of six thousand men at the
gate. In fear of them he sent for Nizam ad-Din
and the chief men of the town. He had been drinking
wine and there and then inside his ca^e they applied
to him the punishment prescribed by law and left
him.^° Later on Nizam ad-Din was killed by a
Turkish amir whom he had offended. After this had
happened King Husayn sent his cousin Malik Warna,
who had been associated with Nizam ad-Din in his
reforming adlivities, as ambassador to the king of
Siji^an, and when he arrived there, ordered him to
^ay there in Siji^an and not to return to him. Malik
Warna went on to India, where I met him as I was
leaving Sind. He was an excellent man with a liking
for authority, hunting, falcons, horses, slaves, servants,
and rich and kingly robes. Now India is no place
for a man of this charadler. In his case the king of
India appointed him governor of a small town, and he
was assassinated there by a man from Herat who was
living in India. It is said that the king of India was
the inftigator of his assassin at the in^ance of King
Husayn, and it was for this reason that King Husayn
acknowledged the king of India as his suzerain after
the death of Malik Warna.

From Herat we journeyed to the town of Jam,
which is of middling size in a fertile di^rift.^^ Mo^

of the trees arc mulberries, and there is a great deal
of silk there. This town derives its name from the
saint and ascetic Ahmad al-Jdm, to whose descendants
it now belongs (for it is independent of the sultan)
and who possess great wealth. We went next to
Tiis, which is one of the largest cities in Khurdsdn,
and thence to Mashhad ar-Ridd [Meshhed], which is
also a large town with abundant fruit-trees, dlreams,
and mills.^ The noble mausoleum is surmounted
by a great dome of elegant condlruftion, the walls
being decorated with coloured tiles. Opposite the
tomb [of the Imdm] is the tomb of Caliph Hdnin
ar-Rashfd, which is surmounted by a platform bearing
chandeliers. When a Shi*itc enters to visit it he kicks
the tomb of ar-Rashld with his foot, and pronounces
a blessing on ar-Ridd.

Thence we journeyed through Sarakhs to Zdwa,
the town of the pious shaykh Qutb ad-Dfn Haydar,”
who has given his name to the Haydarf congregation
of darwlshes. These arc the darwfshes who place
iron rings in their hands and ears and other parts of
their bodies. We travelled from there to Naysdbiir,
one of the four capitals of Khurdsdn. It is given the
name of “ Little Damascus ” because of its beauty and
the quantity of its fruit-trees, orchards and dlrcams.
They manufacture here garments of silk and velvet,
which are exported to India. I stayed at the convent
of the learned shaykh Qutb ad-Dln an-Naysdbdrl, who
showed me great hospitality, and I was witness to
^some adlonishing miracles performed by him. I had
bought in this town a young Turkish slave, and the
shaykh, seeing him with me, said “ This boy is no
good to you. Sell him.” I did as he said and sold
him next day to a merchant, then bade the shaykh
farewell and left. When I ilopped at Bidldm, one of
^y friends wrote to me from Naysdbiir and told me
that the slave had killed a Turkish boy and had been
177 N

put to death for it. This is an evident miracle to the
credit of the shaykh.

From Naysabdr I travelled to the town of Bi^am/^
and thence to Qundds and Baghlan,^ which are villages
inhabited by shaykhs and pious persons. At Qundds
we encamped by a stream, where there was a hospice
belonging to an Egyptian shaykh called Shir-i Siyah,
which means “ The Black Lion.” We were hospitably
received by the governor of that country, a man from
Mosul, who lives in a large garden there. We ^ayed
outside this village about forty days to pa^ure our
camels and horses, for there is excellent pa^urage
there and perfeft security, owing to the ^ri6l measures
of the amir, who enforces the Turkish laws regarding
horse-dealing which we have already mentioned
[p. 143]. After we had been daying there ten days
we missed three of our horses, but they were redored
to us by the Tatars a fortnight later, through fear of
the application of these laws to themselves.

Another reason for our halt was fear of the snow,
for on the road there is a mountain called Hindiikdsh,
which means “ Slayer of Indians,” because the slave
boys and girls who are brought from India die there
in large numbers as a result of the extreme cold and
the quantity of snow. The passage extends for a
whole day’s march.^® We dayed until the warm
weather had definitely set in, and crossed this moun-
tain by a continuous march from before dawn to
sunset. We kept spreading felt cloths in front of
the camels for them to tread on so that they should
not sink in the snow. On setting out from Baghlan
we journeyed to a place called Andar [Andarab]. In
former times there was a town here whose traces have
disappeared, and we halted at a large village where
there is a hospice belonging to an excellent man
named Muhammad al-Mahrawi. We dayed with
him and he treated us with consideration. When we

178



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTX3TA

washed our hands after eating he would drink the
water in which we had washed because of the high
c^eem in which he held us. He travelled with us
until we climbed the mountain of Hinddkdsh men-
tioned above. On this mountain we found a warm
^ream spring, and washed our faces in it, with the
result that the skin peeled off our faces and we suffered
some pain.

We halted next at a place called Banj Hfr [PanjshfrJ,
which means “ Five Mountains,” where there was once
a fine and populous city built on a great river with
blue water like the sea. This country was devaAated
by Tinklz, the king of the Tatars, and has not been
inhabited since. We came to a mountain called
Pashdy, where there is the convent of the shaykh Atd
Awlij’d, which means ^ Father of the Saints.” He is
also ^led Sfsad Sdlah, which is the Persian for ” three
hundred years,*' because they say that he is three
hundred and fifty years old. They have a very high
opinion of him and come to visit him from the towns
and villages, and sultans and princesses visit him too.
He received us with honour and made us his guedls.
We encamped by a river near his convent and went
to see him, and when I saluted him he embraced me.
His skin is fresh and smoother than any 1 have seen;
anyone seeing him would take him to be fifty years
old. He told me that he grew new hair and teeth
every hundred years. ’ 1 had some doubts about him,
however, and God knows how much truth there is
in what he says.

We travelled thence to Parwdn, where I met the
amfr Buruntayh. He treated me well and wrote to
his representatives at Ghazna enjoining them to
show me honour. We went on to the village of
Charkh [Charikar], it being now summer, and from
there to the town of Ghazna. This is the town of
.the famous warrior-sultan Mahmiid ibn Sabuktagfn,
179

one of the greater of rulers, who made frequent raids
into India and captured cities and fortresses there.’^'^
His grave is in this city and is surmounted by a hospice.
The greater part of the town is in ruins and nothing
but a fra(5fion of it remains, though it was once a large
city. It has an exceedingly cold climate, and the
inhabitants move from it in the cold season to Qandahar,
a large and prosperous town three nights’ journey
from Ghazna, but I did not visit it. We travelled on
to Kabul, formerly a va^ town, the site of which is
now occupied by a village inhabited by a tribe of
Persians called Afghdns. They hold mountains and
defiles and possess considerable strength, and are
mo^ly highwaymen. Their principal mountain is
called Kdh Sulayman. It is told that the prophet
Sulayman [Solomon] ascended this mountain and
having looked out over India, which was then covered
with darkness, returned without entering it.

From Kdbul we rode to Karmash, which is a fortress
belonging to the Afghdns, lying between two hills
where they intercept traffic on the road. During our
passage we had an engagement with them. They were
podted on the lower slope of the hill, but we shot
arrows at them and they fled. Our party was travel-
ling light and had about four thousand horses. I had
camels, as a result of which I became separated from
the caravan along with a party including a number of
Afghdns. We jettisoned some* of our provisions and
abandoned the loads of the camels that were jaded,
on the route, but next day our horses returned and
picked them up. We rejoined the caravan in the
late evening and passed the night at the station of
Shashnaghdr, which is the laft inhabited place on the
confines of the Turkish lands. From here we entered
the great desert which extends for fifteen days and
can be traversed only in one season of the year, after
the rains have fallen in Sind and India, that is at the

i8o



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

beginning of July.^* In this desert blows the deadly
samiim wind. A great caravan which preceded us
lo£I many camels and horses, but our company arrived
safely — praise be to God ! — at Panj Ab [Indus] which
is the river of Sind and means “ The Five Rivers.”
These flow into the great river and irrigate those
diRri^Is. We reached this river on the night that
the new moon of Muharram of the year 734 [12th
September 1333J rose upon us. From this point the
intelligence officials wrote to India informing the king
of our ariival and giving him all the details concern-
ing us.

Here ends the narrative of this journey. Praise
be to God, Lord of the worlds.

CH^VPTEB VI


Wii£N wc reached this river caJIcd Pani Ab, which
is the frontier of the territories of the sultan of India
and Sind, the otHcials of the intelligence service came
to us and sent a report about us to the governor of
the city of Multdn. From Sind to the city of Dihlf
[Delhi], the sultan's capital, it is Hfty days* march,
but when the intelligence otBccrs write to the sultan
from, Sind the letter reaches him in five days by the
poAal service. In India the poAal service is of two
kinds.^ The mounted couriers travel on horses
belonging to the sultan with relay's every four miles.
The service of couriers on foot is organized in the
following manner. At every third of a mile there is
an inhabited village, outside which there are three
pavilions. In these sit men girded up ready to move
off, each of whom has a rod a yard and a half long
with brass bells at the top. "When a courier leaves
the town he takes the letter in the fingers of one hand
and the rod with the bells in the other, and runs with
all his might. The men in the pavilions, on hearing
the sound of the bells, prepare to meet him, and when
he reaches them one of them takes the letter in his
hand and passes on, running with all his might and
shaking his rod until he reaches the next Nation,
and so the letter is passed on till it reaches its
dcflinalion. This poft is quicker than the mounted
pofl. It is sometimes used to transport fruits from
Khurdsin which arc highly valued in India; they arc

SELECTIONS FROM THE

put on plates and carried with great speed, to the
sultan. In the same way they transport the principal
criminals; they are each placed on a ^retcher and the
couriers run carrying the stretcher on their heads.
The sultan’s drinking water is brought to him by the
same means, when he resides at Dawlat Abad, from
the river Kank (Ganges), to which the Hindus go on
pilgrimage and which is at a di^ance of forty days’
journey from there.

When the intelligence officials write to the sultan
informing him of those who arrive in his country,
he Judies the report very minutely. They take the
utmost care in this matter, telling him that a certain
man has arrived of such-and-such an appearance and
dress, and noting the number of his party, slaves and
servants and beasts, his behaviour both in adlion and
at re^, and all his doings, omitting no details. When
the new arrival reaches the town of Multan, which is
the capital of Sind, he ftays there until an order is
received from the sultan regarding his entry and the
degree of hospitality to be extended to him. A man
is honoured in that country according to what may be
seen of his actions, conduct, and zeal, since no one
knows anything of his family or lineage. The king
of India, Sultan Muhammad Shah, makes a pradtice
of honouring Grangers and distinguishing them by
governorships or high dignities of State. The majority
of his courtiers, palace officials, ministers of State,
judges, and relatives by marriage are foreigners, and
he has issued a decree that foreigners are to be given
in his country the title of [Honourable], so that
this has become a proper name for them.

Every person proceeding to the court of this king
muSt needs have a gift ready to present to him, in
order to gain his favour. The sultan requites him
for it by a gift many times its value. When his
subjects grew accuSlomed to this pradlice,the merchants

184







TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

in Sind and India began to furnish each newcomer
with thousands of dinars as a loan, and to supply him
with whatever he might desire to offer as a gift or to
use on his own behalf, such as riding animals, camels,
and goods. They place both their money and their
persons at his service, and ^and before him like
attendants. When he reaches the sultan, he receives
a magnificent gift from him and pays off his debt to
them. This trade of theirs is a flourishing one and
brings in va^l profits. On reaching Sind I followed
this pradlicc and bought horses, camels, white slaves
and other goods from the merchants. I had already
bought from an *Irdq( merchant in Ghazna about
thirty horses and a camel with a load of arrows, for
this is one of the things presented to the sultan. This
merchant went off to Khurdsin and on returning to
India received his money from me. He made an
enormous profit through me and became one of the
principal merchants. I met him many years later,
at Aleppo, when the infidels had robbed me of every-
thing I possessed, but he gave me no assiftance.

After crossing the river of Sind called Panj Ab,
our way led through a foredl of reeds, in which I saw
a rhinoceros for the fir£l time. After two days’
march we reached Jandnf, a large and fine town on
the bank of the river of Sind. Its people are a people
called the Simira, whose anceflors eftablished them-
selves there on the conqueA of Sind in the time of
al-Hajjdj [712 a.d.]. These people never eat with
anyone, nor may anyone observe them while they are
eating, and they never marry outside their dan.^
From Jandnl we travelled to Slwasitdn [Sehwan], a
large town, outside which is a sandy desert, treeless
except for acacias. Nothing is grown on the river
here except pumpkins, and the food of the inhabitants
considls of sorghum and peas, of which they make
bread. There is a plentiful supply of fish and buffalo
185



SELECTIONS FROM THE

milk, and they eat also a kind of small lizard fluffed
with curcuma. When I saw this small animal and
them eating it, I took a loathing at it and would not
eat it. We entered Siwasitan during the hotted
period of the summer. The heat was intense, and my
companions used to sit naked except for a cloth round
the wai^l and another soaked with water on their
shoulders ; this dried in a very short time and they had
to keep con^antly wetting it again. ^

In this town I met the distinguished do6tor ‘Ala
al-Mulk of Khurasan, formerly qadi of Herat, who
had come to join the king of India and had been
appointed governor of the town and province of
Lahari in Sind. I decided to travel thither with him.
He had fifteen ships with which he sailed down the
river, carrying his baggage. One of these was a ship
called the ^awrah^ resembling the tartan of our
country, but broader and shorter. In the centre of
it there was a wooden cabin reached by a Staircase,
and on top of this there was a place prepared for the
governor to sit in. His suite sat in front of him and
slaves Stood to right and left, while the crew of about
forty men rowed. Accompanying the ahawrah were
four ships to right and left, two of which carried
the governor’s Standards, kettledrums, trumpets and
singers. Fir^ the drums and trumpets were sounded
and then the musicians sang, and this continued
alternately from early morning to the lunch hour.
When this moment arrived, the ships closed up and
gangways were placed from one to the other. The
musicians then came from on board the governor’s
ahawrah and sang until he finished eating, when they
had their meal and returned to their vessel. The
journey continued thereafter as before until nightfall.
The camp was then set up on the bank of the river,
the governor disembarked, tables were set and mo^
of the troops joined in the meal. After the la^ evening

i86



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

prayer sentries were polled for the night in reliefs.
As each relief hnished its tour of duty one of them
cried in a loud voice “ O lord King/ so many hours
of the night arc pait” At dawn the trumpets and
drums sounded and the dawn prayer was said, then
food was brought and when the meal was Hnished they
resumed their journey.

After five days' travelling we reached ‘Aid al-Mulk's
province, Ldharf, a fine town on the coadl where the
river of Sind discharges itself into the ocean.® It
possesses a large harbour, visited by men from Yemen,
Fdrs, and elsewhere. For this reason its contribu-
tions to the Treasury and its revenues are consider-
able; the governor told me that the revenue from
this town amounted to sixty lakhs per annum. The
governor receives a twentieth part of this, that being
the footing on which the sultan commits the pro-
vinces to his governors. I rode out one dav with
‘Aid al-Mulk, and we came to a plain called Tdrna,
seven miles from Ldharf, where I saw an innumerable
quantity of Aones in the shape of men and animals.
Many of them were disfigurea and their forms effaced,
but mere remained a head or a foot or something of
the sort. Some of the Aones also had the shape of
grains of wheat, chickpeas, beans and lentils, and there
were remains of a city wall and house walls. We saw
too the ruins of a house with a chamber of hewn
Aones, in the midA of which there was a platform of
hewn Aones resembling a single block, surmounted
by a human figure, except that its head was elongated
and its mouth on the side of its face and its hands
behind its back like a pinioned captive. The place
had pools of Ainking water and an inscription on one
of its walls in Indian charaAers. ‘Aid d-Mulk told
me that the hiAorians relate that in this place there
was a great city whose inhabitants were so depraved
that they were turned to Aone, and that it is their
187



SELECTIONS FROM THE

king who is on the terrace in the house, which is ^till
called “ the king’s palace.” They add that the in-
scription gives the date of the de^rudlion of the people
of that city, which occurred about a thousand years
ago.®

When I had spent five days in this city with ‘Ala
al-Mulk, he gave me a generous travelling provision
and I left for the town of Bakar, a fine city intersefted
by a channel from the river of Sind.*^ In the middle
of this canal there is a fine hospice at which travellers
are entertained. Thereafter I travelled from Bakar to
the large town of Uja [Uch] which lies on the bank
of the river and has fine bazaars and buildings. The
governor there at the time was the excellent king, the
Sharif Jalal ad-DIn al-Kijf, a gallant and generous
man. We formed a strong affeftion for one another,
and met later on at the capital, Delhi. When the
sultan left for Dawlat Abdd and bade me remain in
the capital, Jalal ad-Din said to mfe “ You will require
a large sum for your expenses and the sultan will
be away for a long time, so take my village and use its
revenues until I return.” I did so and gained about
five thousand dinars — ^may God give him riche^
recompense ! From Uja I travelled to Multan, the
capital of Sind and residence of the principal amir.

On the road to Multan and ten miles di^ant from
it is the river called Khusraw Abad, a large river that
cannot be crossed except by boat.® At this point the
goods and baggage of all who pass are subjedfed to
a rigorous examination. Their cu^om at the time
of our arrival was to take a quarter of everything
brought in by the merchants, and exadt a duty of
seven dinars for every horse. The idea of having my
t>aggage searched was very disagreeable to me, for
there was nothing valuable in it, though it seemed
a great deal in the eyes of the people. By the grace
of God there arrived on the scene one of the principal

i88



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

officers from the governor of Multin, who gave orders
that I should not be subjeftcd to examination or search.
We spent that night on the bank of the river and next
morning were visited by the poilma^er, who is the
person who keeps the sultan informed of affairs in
that town and di^lridl and of all that happens in it
and all who come to it. I was introduced to him and
went in his company to visit the governor of Multdn,
Qutb al-Mulk,

When I entered his presence, he rose to greet me,
shook my hand, and bade me sit beside him. 1
presented him with a white slave, a horse, and some
raisins and almonds. These are among the greatest
gifts that can be made to them, since they do not
grow in their land and arc imported from Khurdsdn.
The governor sat on a large carpeted dais, with the
army commanders on his right and left and armed
men dlanding at his back. The troops are passed in
review before him and a number of bows are kept
there. When anyone comes desiring to be enrolled
in the army as an archer, he is given one of the bows
to draw. They differ in dliffness, and his pay is
graduated according to the dlrength he shows in
drawing them. Anyone desiring to be enrolled as a
trooper sets off his horse at a canter or gallop and
tries to hit a target set up there with his lance. There
is a ring there too, suspended to a low wall; the candi-
date sets off his horse at a canter until he comes level
with the ring, and if he lifts it off with his lance he
is accounted by them a good horseman. For those
wishing to be enrolled as mounted archers there is a
ball placed on the ground, and their pay is propor-
tioned to their accuracy in hitting it with an arrow
while going at a canter or gallop.

Two months after we reached Multdn one of the
sultan’s household officers and the chief of police
arrived to arrange for the journey of the new arrivals
189



SELECTIONS FROM THE

[to Delhi]. They came to me together and asked me
why I had come to India. I replied that I had come
to enter the service of the Khund Alam [‘^ Ma^er of
the World ”], as the sultan is called in his dominions.
He had given orders that no one coming from
Khurasan should be allowed to enter India unless he
came with the intention of laying there. When I
had given my answer they called the qadi and notaries
and drew up a document witnessing to my under-
taking and those of my company who wished to
remain in India, but some of them refused to engage
themselves. We then prepared for the journey to
the capital, which is forty days’ march from Multan
through a continuous Wretch of inhabited country.
The principal member of our party was Khudhawand
Zadah, qadi of Tirmidh, who had come with his wife
and children. The chamberlain made special arrange-
ments for his journey and took twenty cooks with
him from Multan, himself going ahead with them
every night to prepare his meals, etc.

The fir^ town we reached after leaving Multdn
was Abiihar [Abohar], which is the firdl town in India
proper, and thence we entered a plain extending for
a day’s journey. On the borders of this plain are
inaccessible mountains, inhabited by Hindu infidels;
some of them are subjects [ryots] under Muslim rule,
and live in villages governed by a Muslim headman
appointed by the governor in whose fief the village
lies. Others of them are rebels and warriors, who
maintain themselves in the fastnesses of the moun-
tains and make plundering raids. On this road we
fell in with a raiding party, this being the firSt engage-
ment I witnessed in India. The main party had left
Abfihar in the early morning, but I had ^ayed there
with a small party of my companions until midday
and when we left, numbering in all twentyrtwo horse-
men, partly Arabs and partly Persians and Turks, we

190



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

were attacked on this plain by eighty infidels on foot
with two horsemen. My companions were men of
courage and ability and wc fought stoutly with them,
killing one of the horsemen and about twelve of the
footsoldicrs. I was hit by an arrow and my horse
by another, but God preserved me from them, for
there is no force in their arrows. One of our party
had his horse wounded, but we gave him in exchange
the horse we had captured from the infidel, and killed
the wounded horse, which was eaten by the Turks
of our party. Wc carried the heads of the slain to
the caAle of Abii Bak’har, which wc reached about
midnight, and suspended them from the wall.

Two days later wc reached Ajiidahan [Pakpattan],
a small town belonging to the pious Shaykh Farfd
ad-Dfn.® As I returned to the camp after visiting
this personage, I saw the people hurrying out, and some
of our party along with them. I asked them what
was happening and they told me that one of the Hindu
infidels had died, that a fire had been kindled to burn
him, and his wife would burn herself along with him.
After the burning my companions came back and told
me that she had embraced the dead man until she
herself was burned with him. Later on I used often
to see a Hindu woman, richly dressed, riding on horse-
back, followed by both Muslims and infidels and pre-
ceded by drums and trumpets; she was accompanied
by Brahmans, who are the chiefs of the Hindus. In
the sultan’s dominions they ask his permission to
burn her, which he accords them. The burning of
the wife after her husband’s death is regarded by them
as a commendable aft, but is not compulsory; only
when a widow burns herself her family acquire a
certain preftige by it and gain a reputation for fidelity.
A widow who does not burn herself dresses in coarse
garments and lives with her own people in misery,
despised for her lack of fidelity, but she is not forced
191



SELECTIONS FROM THE

to burn herself. Once in the town of Amjari [Am-
ihera, near Dhar] I saw three women whose husbands
had been killed in battle and who had agreed to burn
themselves. Each one had a horse brought to her
and mounted it, richly dressed and perfumed. . In her
right hand she held a coconut, with which she played,
and in her left a mirror, in which she looked at her
face. They were surrounded by Brahmans and their
own relatives, and were preceded by drums, trumpets
and bugles. Everyone of the infidels said to them
“ Take greetings from me to my father, or brother
or mother, or friend ” and they would say Yes
and smile at them. I rode out with my companions
to see the way in which the burning was carried out.
After three miles we came to a dark place with nmch
water and shady trees, among^ which there were
pavilions, each containing a ^one idol. Between the
pavilions there was a basin of water over which a
dense shade was ca^ by trees so thickly set that the
sun could not penetrate them. The place looked like
a spot in hell — God preserve us from it ! On reach-
ing these pavilions they descended to the pool, plunged
into it and dive^ed themselves of their clothes and
ornaments, which they di^ributed as alms. Each one
was then given an unsewn garment of coarse cotton
and tied part of it round her wai^ and part over her
head and shoulders. The fires had been lit near this
basin in a low lying spot, and oil of sesame poured
over them, so that the flames were increased. There
were about fifteen men there with faggots of thin
wood and about ten others with heavy pieces of wood,
and the drummers and trumpeters were ^landing by
waiting for the woman’s coming. The fire was
screened off by a blanket held by some men, so that
she should not be frightened by the sight of it. I saw
one of them, on coming to the blanket, pull it violently
out of the men’s hands, saying to them with a smile

192



TRAVELS OF lUN BATTOTA

** Do vou fnghtcn me with the fire ? I know that it
is a nrc, so let me alone.” Thereupon she joined
her hands above her head tn salutation to the fire and
caR herself into it. At the same moment the drums,
trumpets and bugles were sounded, the men threw
their firewood on her and the others put the heavy
wood on lop of her to prevent her moving, cries were
raised and there was a loud clamour. When 1 saw
this I had all but fallen oft my horse, if my companions
had not (Quickly brought water to me and laved my
face, after which I withdrew.

The Indians have a similar praflice of drowning
themselves and many of them do so in the river
Ganges, the river to which they go on pilgrimage,
and into which the ashes of those who arc burned arc
cast. They say that it is a river of Paradise. When
one of them comes to drown himself he says to those
present with him, ”Do not think that I drowm myself
lor any worldly reason or through penury; mv purpose
is solely to seek approach to Kusiy,” Kusiy being the
name of Cod in thetr language.'® He then drowns
himself, and when he is dead they take him out and
burn him and caA his ashes into this river.

Let us return to our original topic. We set out
from the town of Ajddahan, and after four days'
march reached Sarasatf [Sarsfiti or Sirsa], a large town
with quantities of rice of an excellent sort which is
exported to the capital, Delhi. The town produces
a large revenue; I was told how much it is, out have
forgotten the figure. Thence we travelled to Hdnsf,
an exceedingly fine, well built and populous city,
surrounded by a wall. Two days later we came to
Mas'iid Abdd, which is ten miles from Delhi," and
there we spent three days. The sultan was away at
the time in the diAriA of the town of Qanawj, which
is ten days* march from Delhi, but the queen-mother
was in the capital, and also the sultan's wazfr. He
193 o



SELECTIONS FROM THE

sent his officers to receive us, designating each
one of us a person of his own rank. ^ Meanwhile he
wrote to inform the sultan of our arrival, sending the
letter by courier po^, and received
during the three days that we spent at Mas ud Abad.
Thereafter the qadis, doftors and sh^khs, and some
of the amirs came out to meet us. The Indians c^l
the amirs “ kings,” using the term “ king where the
people of Diyar-Bakr, Egypt, and elsewhere say
“amir.” We then set out from Mas'dd Abad and
halted near a village called Palam. On the next day
we arrived at the city of Dihli [Delhi], the metropolis
of India, a va^ and magnificent city, uniting beauty
with ^rength. It is surrounded by a wall that has
no equal in the world, and is the larged city in India,
nay rather the larged city in the entire Muslim

Orient. . ,

The city of Delhi is made up now of four neigh-
bouring and contiguous towns. One of them is
Delhi proper, the old city built by the infidels and
captured in the year ii88. The second is calle
Siri, known also as the Abode of the Caliphate; this
was the town given by the sultan to Ghiyath ad-Din,
the grandson of the ‘Abbasid Caliph Multansir, when
he came to his court. The third is called Tughlaq
Abad, after its founder, the Sultan Tughlaq,' the^
father of the sultan of India to whose court we came.
The reason why he built it was that one day he said
to a former sultan “ O ma^er of the world, it were
fitting that a city should be built here.” The sultan
replied to him in je^ “ When you are sultan, build
it.” It came about by the decree of God that he
became sultan, so he built it and called it by his own
name. The fourth is called Jahan Panah, and is
set apart for the residence of the reigning sultan,
Muhammad Shah. He was the founder of it, and it
was his intention to unite these four towns within

194



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

a single wall, but after building part of it he gave
up the re^l because of the expense required for its
conftruftion.^

The cathedral mosque occupies a large area; its
walls, roof, and paving are all con^lrufted of white
^ones, admirably squared and firmly cemented with
lead. There is no wood in it at all. It has thirteen
domes of ^lone, its pulpit also is made of ilone, and
it has four courts. In the centre of the mosque is an
awe-inspiring column, and nobody knows of what
metal it is conftrufted. One of their learned men told
me that it is called Haft Jushy which means “ seven
metals,” and that it is con^lrufted from these seven.
A ipart of this column, of a finger's breadth, has been
polished, and gives out a brilliant gleam. Iron makes
no impression on it. It is thirty cubits high,^* and
we rolled a turban round it, and the portion which
encircled it measured eight cubits. At the ea^erni
gate there are two enormous idols of brass pro^ratej
on the ground and held by atones, and everyone)
entering or leaving the mosque treads on them. The
site was formerly occupied by an idol temple, and was
converted into a mosque on the conquest of the city.
In the northern court is the minaret, which has no
parallel in the lands of Islam. It is built of red 5lone,
unlike the re^ of the edifice, ornamented with sculp-
tures, and of great height. The ball on the top is of
glistening white marble and its “ apples ” [small balls
surmounting a minaret] are of pure gold. The
passage is so wide that elephants could go up by it.
A person in whom I have confidence told me that when
it was built he saw an elephant climbing with Clones
to the top. The Sultan Qutb ad-Din wished to build
one in the western court even larger, but was cut off
by death when only a third of it had been completed.
This minaret is one of the wonders of the world for
size, and the width of its passage is such that three

elephants could mount it abreast. The third of it
built equals in height the whole of the other minaret
we have mentioned in the northern court, though to
one looking at it from below it does not seem so high
because of its bulk.

Outside Delhi is a large reservoir named after the
Sultan Lalmish, from which the inhabitants draw
their drinking water. It is supplied by rain water,
and is about two miles in length by half that breadth.
In the centre there is a great pavilion built of squared
^ones, two Glories high. When the reservoir is filled
with water it can be reached only in boats, but when
the water is low the people go into it. Inside it is
a mosque, and at mo^ times it is occupied by mendi-
cants devoted to the service of God. When the water
dries up at the sides of this reservoir, they sow sugar
canes, cucumbers, green melons and pumpkins there.
The melons and pumpkins are very sweet but of small
size. Between Delhi and the Abode of the Caliphate
is. the private reservoir, which is larger than the other.
Along its sides there are about forty pavilions, and
round about it live the musicians.

Among the learned and pious inhabitants of Delhi
is the devout and humble imam Kamal ad-Dm, called
“ The Cave Man ” from the cave in which he lives
outside the city. I had a slave-boy who ran away
from me, and whom I found in the possession of a
certain Turk. I proposed to take him back from him,
but the shaykh said to me “ This boy is no good to
you. Don’t take him.” The Turk wished to come
to an arrangement, so he paid me a hundred dinars
and kept the boy. Six months later the boy killed
his ma^er and was taken before the sultan, who
ordered him to he handed over to his. maker’s sons,
and they put him to death. When I saw this miracle
on the part of the shaykh I attached myself to him,
withdrawing from the world and giving all that I

196

possessed to the poor and needy. I flayed with him
for some time, and I used to see him fa^ for ten and
twenty days on end and remain ^landing moil of the
night. I continued with him until the sultan sent
for me and I became entangled in the world once
again — may God give me a good ending I

This king is of all men the fondeil of making gifts
and of shedding blood. His gate is never without
some poor man enriched or some living man executed,
and Tories are current amongil the people of his
generosity and courage and of his cruelty and violence
towards criminals. For all that, he is of all men the
moil humble and the readieil to show equity and
juilice. The ceremonies of religion arc ilri<5lly
complied with at his court, and he is severe in the
matter of attendance at prayer and in punishing those
who negleft it. He is one of those kings whose
felicity is unimpaired and surpassing all ordinary
experience, but his dominant equality is generosity.
We shall relate some Tories of this that are marvellous
beyond anything ever heard before, and I call God and
his Angels and His Prophets to witness that all that I tell
of his extraordinary generosity is absolute truth. I know
that some of the instances I shall relate will be unaccept-
able to the minds of many, and that they will regard
them as quite impossible, but in a matter which I
have seen with my own eyes and of which I know
the accuracy and have had a large share, I cannot do
otherwise than speak the truth.

The sultan’s palace at Delhi is called Sara^
and contains many doors. At the fir^ door there are
a number of guardians, and beside it trumpeters and
flute-players. When any amfr or person of note arrives
they sound their instruments and say “ So-and-so has
come, so-and-so has come.” The same takes place also at
the second and third doors. Outside the fir^l door are
platforms on which the executioners sit, for the custom
197



SELECTIONS FROM THE

among^ them is that when the sultan orders a man
to be executed, the sentence is carried out at the door
of the audience hall, and the body lies there over
three nights. Between the fir^ and second doors
there is a large vestibule with platforms along both
sides, on which sit those whose turn of duty it is to-
guard the doors. Between the second and third
doors there is a large platform on which the principal
naqib [keeper of the regi^er] sits; in front of him
there is a gold mace, which he holds in his hand,
and on his head he wears a jewelled tiara of gold,
surmounted by peacock feathers. The second door
leads to an extensive audience hall in which the people
sit. At the third door there are platforms occupied
by the scribes of the door. One of their cu^oms is
that none may pass through this door except those
whom the sultan has prescribed, and for each person
he prescribes a number of his ^aff to enter along with
him. Whenever any person comes to this door the
scribes write down “ So-and-so came at the fir^t hour ”
or the second, and so on, and the sultan receives a
report of this after the evening prayer. Another of
their cu^oms is that anyone who absents himself
from the palace for three days or more, with or with-
out excuse, may not enter this door thereafter except
by the sultan’s permission. If he has an excuse of
illness or otherwise he presents the sultan with a gift
suitable to his rank. The third door opens into an
immense audience hall called Hazdr UUun^ which
means “ A thousand pillars.” The pillars are of wood
and support a wooden roof, admirably carved. The
people sit under this, and it is in this hall that the
sultan holds public audiences.

As a rule his audiences are held in the afternoon,
though he often holds them early in the day. He
sits cross-legged on a throne placed on a dais carpeted
in white, with a large cushion behind him and two

198

others as arm-rcRs on hts right and left. When he
takes his scat, the wazfr Rands in front of him, the
secretaries behind the waxir, then the chamberlains
and so on in order of precedence. As the sultan sits
down the chamberlains and naqlbs sav in their loudcR
voice BhtrMhh, At the sultan's head Rands the
“ great king ” Qib\i!a witli a fly-whisk in his hand
to drive ott the flics. A hundred armour-bearers
Rand on the right and a like number on the left,
carrying shields, sw'ords, and bc^ws. The other
funRionarics and notables sland along the hall to right
and left. Then they bring in sixty horses with the
royal harness, half of which are ranged on the right
and half on the left, where the sultan can see them.
Next fifty elephants arc brought in, which .ire adorned
with silken cloths, and have their tusks shod with iron
for greater cihcac^’ in killing criminals. On the neck
of each elephant is its mahout, who carries a sort of
iron axe with which he punishes it and dircRs it to
do what is required of it. Each elephant has on its
back a sort of large chcR capable of holding twenty
w'arriors or more or less, according to the size of the
bcaR. These elephants arc trained to make obeisance
to the sultan and incline their heads, and when they
do so the chamberlains cry in a loud voice BismilUh.
They also arc arranged half on the right and half on
the left behind the persons Randing. As each person
enters who has an appointed place of Randing on the
right or left, he makes obeisance on reaching the
Ration of the chamberlains, and the chamberlains say
BiimitUhy regulating the loudness of their utterance
by the rank of the person concerned, who then retires
to his appointed place, beyond which he never passes.
If it is one of the inildcl Hindus who makes obeisance,
the chamberlains say to him God guide thee.”

If there should be anyone at the door who has
come to ofTcr the sultan a gift, the chamberlains enter

the sultan’s presence in order of precedence, make
obeisance in three places, and inform the sultan of
the person at the door. If he commands them to
bring him in, they place the gift in the hands of men
who ^and with it in front of the sultan where he can
see it. He then calls in the donor, who makes
obeisance three times before reaching the sultan and
makes another obeisance at the Nation of the chamber-
lains. The sultan then addresses him in person with
the greatest courtesy and bids him welcome. If he
is a person who is worthy of honour, the sultan takes
him by the hand or embraces him, and asks for some
part of his present. It is then placed before him,
and if it consi^s in weapons or fabrics he turns it this
way and that with his hand and expresses his approval,
to set the donor at ease and encourage him. He gives
him a robe of honour and assigns him a sum of money
to wash his head, according to their cu^lom in this
case, proportioned to his merits.

When the sultan returns from a journey, the
elephants are decorated, and on sixteen of them are
placed sixteen parasols, some brocaded and some set
with jewels. Wooden pavilions are built several
Tories high and covered with silk cloths, and in each
^lory there are singing girls wearing magnificent
dresses and ornaments, with dancing girls amongst
them. In the centre of each pavilion is a large tank
made of skins and filled with syrup-water, from which
all^ the people, natives or Grangers, may drink, re-
ceiving at the same time betel leaves and areca nuts.
The space between the pavilions is carpeted with silk
cloths, on which the sultan’s horse treads. The walls
of the ^reet along which he passes from the gate of
the city to the gate of the palace are hung with silk
cloths. In front of him march footmen from his
own slaves, several thousands in number, and behind
come the mob and the soldiers. On one of his entries

200

into the capital I saw three or four small catapults
placed on elephants throwing gold and silver coins
amongst the people from the moment when he entered
the city until he reached the palace.

I shall now mention a few of his magniheent gifts
and largesses. The merchant Shihdb ad -Din of
Kdzanin, who was a friend of al-Kdzaninfj the “ king ”
of the merchants in India, was invited by the latter
to join him and arrived with a valuable present for
the sultan. On their way they were attacked by a
considerable force of infidds, who killed the “ king ”
of the merchants and carried off as booty his money
and treasures and Shihdb ad-Dln^s present. Shihdb
ad-Dln himself escaped with his life, and the sultan,
on hearing of this, gave orders that he should be given
thirty thousand dinars and return to his own country.
He refused to accept it, however, saying that he had
come for the express purpose of seeing the sultan
and kissing the ground before him. They wrote to
the sultan to this effe^ and he, gratified with what
Shihdb ad-D(n had said, commanded him to be brought
to Delhi with every mark of honour. When Shihdb
ad-Dln was introduced into the sultan’s presence, the
sultan made him a rich present, and some days later
asked where he was. On hearing that he was ill,
he commanded one of his courtiers to go instantly
to the treasury and take a hundred thousand tangahs
of gold (the tangah being worth two and a half
Moroccan dinars) and carry them to him to set him
at ease. He ordered him to buy with this money
what Indian goods he pleased, and gave in^lruflions
that no one else should buy anything at all until
Shihdb ad-Dln had made all his purchases. In addi-
tion he ordered three ships to be made ready for his
journey with complete equipment and full pay and
provisions for the crew. So Shihdb ad-Dln departed
and disembarked in the island of Hormuz, where he
201



SELECTIONS FROM THE

built a great house. I saw this house later on, and I
saw also Shihab ad-Din, having lo^ all that' he had,
soliciting a gift at Shiraz from its sultan, Abu Ishaq.
That is the way with riches amassed in these Indian
lands; it is only rarely that anyone gets out ot the
country with them, and when he does leave it ana
reaches some other country, God sends upon him
some calamity which annihilates all that he possesses.
So it happened to Shihab ad-Din, for everything that
he had was taken from him in the civil war be^een
the king of Hormuz and his nephews, and he left the
country Gripped of all his wealth.

The dodlor Shams ad-Din, who was a philosopher
and a born poet, wrote a laudatory ode to the sultan
in Persian. The ode contained, twenty-seven verses,
and the sultan gave him a thousand silver dinars for •
each verse. This is more than has ever been related
of former kings, for they used to give a thousand
dirhams for each verse, which is only a tenth of the
sultan’s gift. Then too when the sultan heard the
^ory of the learned and pious qadi Majd ad-Din m
Shiraz, whose hiftory we have written in the^ nrft
volume, he sent ten thousand silver dinars to him at
Shiraz. Again, Burhan ad-Din of Sagharj [near
Samarqand] was a preacher and imam so liberal in
spending what he possessed that he used often to
contradl debts in order to give to others. The sultan
heard of him and sent him forty thousand dinars,
with a request that he would come to Delhi. He
accepted the gift and paid his debts with it, but went
off to Cathay and refused to come to the sultan, saying
“ I shall not go to a sultan in whose presence scholars
have to ^and.”

One of the Indian nobles claimed that the sultan
had put his brother to death without cause, and cited
him before the qadi. The sultan walked on foot and
unarmed to the qadi’s tribunal, saluted him and made

202



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

obeisance, having previously commanded the qddi not
to rise before him or move when he entered his court,
and. remained ^landing before him. The qadi gave
judgment againdl the sultan, to the effeft that he mudt
give satisfa^on to his adversary for the blood of his
brother, and he did so. At another time a certain
Muslim claimed that the sultan owed him a sum of
money. They carried the matter before the qddi,
who gave judgment again^ the sultan for the payment
of the debt, and he paid it.

When a famine broke out in India and Sind, and
prices became so high that a maund of wheat rose
to six dinars, the sultan ordered that every person in
Delhi should be given six months’ provisions from
the granary, at the rate of a pound and a half per
person per day, small or great, freeman or slave. The
doctors and qddis set about compiling regidlers of the
population of each quarter and brought the people,
each of whom received six months’ provisions.

In spite of all we have said of his humility, ju^ice,
compassion for the needy, and extraordinary generosity,
the sultan was far too ready to shed blood. He
punished small faults and great, without respect of
persons, whether men of learning, piety, or high
Elation. Every day hundreds of people, chained,
pinioned, and fettered, arc brought to his hall, and
those who are for execution are executed, those for
torture tortured, and those for beating beaten. It is
his cuftom that every day all persons who are in his
prison are brought to the hall, except only on Fridays;
this is a day of respite for them, on which they clean
themselves and remain at ease — may God deliver us
from misfortune 1 The sultan had a half-brother
named Mas'dd Khan, whose mother was the daughter
of Sultan *Ala ad-Dfn, and who was one of the mo^
beautiful men I have ever seen on earth. He suspefted
him of wishing to revolt, and questioned him on the
203



SELECTIONS FROM THE

matter. Mas‘iid confessed through fear of torture,
for anyone who denies an accusation of this sort which
the sultan formulates again^ him is put to the torture,
and the people consider death a lighter afBidlion than
torture. The sultan gave orders that he should be
beheaded in the market place, and his body lay there
for three days according to their custom.

One of the graved charges again^ the sultan is
that of compelling the inhabitants of Delhi to leave
the town. The reason for this was that they used to
write missives reviling and insulting him, seal them
and inscribe them, “ By the hand of the Master of
the World, none but he may read this.” They then
threw them into the audience-hall at night, and when
the sultan broke the seal he found them full of insults
and abuse. He decided to lay Delhi in ruins, and
having bought from all the inhabitants their houses
and dwellings and paid them the price of them, he
commanded them to move to Dawlat Abad.^® They
refused, and his herald was sent to proclaim that no
person should rernain in the city after three nights.
The majority complied with the order, but some of
them hid in the houses. The sultan ordered a search
to be made for any persons remaining in the town,
and his slaves found two men in the Greets, one a
cripple and the other blind. They were brought
before him and he gave orders that the cripple should
be flung from a mangonel and the blind man dragged
from Delhi to Dawlat Abad, a di^ance of forty days’
journey. He fell to pieces on the road and all of him
that reached Dawlat Abdd was his leg. When the
sultan did this, every person left the town, abandoning
furniture and possessions, and the city remained
utterly deserted. A person in whom I have con-
fidence told me that the sultan mounted one night
to the roof of his palace and looked out over Delhi,
where there was neither fire nor smoke nor lamp,

204



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

and said “ Now my mind is tranquil and my wrath
appeased.” Afterwards he wrote to the inhabitants of
the other cities commanding them to move to Delhi
to repopulate it. The residt was only to ruin their
cities and leave Delhi ^ill unpopulated) because of
its immensity, for it is one of the greatest cities in
the world. It was in this ^late that we found it on
our arrival, empty and unpopulated, save for a few
inhabitants.

Let us return now to that which concerns us, and
relate how we arrived firSt at the capital and our for-
tunes until we left his service. We reached Delhi
during the sultan*s absence, and proceeded to the
palace, where, after passing the fir^l, second, and third
doors, the principal naqlb introduced us into a spacious
audience-hall. Here we found the wazfr awaiting us.
On passing through the third door the great hall
called Haz4r USlun^ where the sultan holds his public
audiences, met our eyes. Thereupon the wazlr made
obeisance until his head nearly touched the ground,
and we too made obeisance by inclining the body and
touching the ground with our fingers, in the direction
of the sultan's throne. When we had performed this
ceremony the naqlbs cried in a loud voice Bismiliahy
and we zW retired.

After visiting the palace of the sultan’s mother and
presenting her with a gift, we returned to the house
which had been prepared for our occupation, and
hospitality-gifts were sent to us. In the house I
found everything that was required in the way of
furniture, carpets, mats, vessels, and bed. The beds
in’’India are light, and can be carried by a single man;
every person when travelling has to transport his own
bed, which his slave boy carries on his head. It
consifts of four conical legs with four crosspieces of
wood on which braids of silk or cotton are woven.
When one lies down on it, there is no need for any-
205



SELECTIONS FROM THE

thing to make it pliable, for it is pliable of itself.
Along with the bed they brought two mattresses and
pillows and a coverlet, all made of silk. Their cu^om
is to put linen or cotton slips on the mattresses and
coverlets, so that when they become dirty they wash
the slips, while the bedding inside is kept clean.
Next day we rode to the palace to salute the wazir,
who gave me two purses, each containing a thousand
silver dinars, saying “ This is for washing your head,”
and in addition gave me a robe of fine goathair. A
li^ was made of all my companions, servants, and
slave boys, and they were divided into four categories ;
those in the fir^ category each received two hundred
dinars, in the second a hundred and fifty, the third
a hundred, and the fourth sixty-five. There were
about forty of them, and the total sum given to them
was four thousand odd dinars. After that the sultan’s
hospitality-gift was fixed. This was composed of- a
thousand pounds of Indian flour, a thousand pounds
of flesh-meat, and I cannot say how many pounds of
sugar, ghee, and areca-nuts, with a thousand betel
leaves. The Indian pound equals twenty of our
Moroccan pounds and twenty-five Egyptian pounds.
Later on the sultan commanded some villages to be
assigned to me to the yestrly revenue of five thousand
dinars.

On the 4th of Sha-wwal [8th June 1334] the sultan
returned, to the ca^e of Tilbat, seven miles from
the capital, and the wazir ordered us to go out
to him. We set out, each man with his present of
horses, camels, fruits, swords, etc., and assembled at
the gate of the ca^le. The newcomers were intro-
duced in order of precedence and were given robes
of linen, embroidered in gold. When my turn came
I entered and found the sultan seated on a chair.
At fir^ I took him to be one of the chamberlains.
When I had twice made obeisance the “ king ” of the



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

Sultan’s intimate courtiers said “ BismiUaht Mawldnd
Badr ad^DIn,” for in India they used to call me Badr
ad'DiH) and [** Our MaAcr ”j is a title

given to all scholars. I approached the sultan, who
took my hand and shook it, and continuing to hold
it addressed me moA affably in Persian, saying
“ Your arrival is blessed; be at ease, I shall be com-
passionate to you and give you such favours that your
fellow-countrymen will hear of It and come to join
you.” Then he asked me where 1 came from and I
answered him, and every time he said any encouraging
word to me I kissed his hand, until I had kissed it
sc\’en times. All the new arrivals then assembled and
a meal was served to them.

Aftenv^ards the sultan used to summon us to eat
in his presence and would enquire how we fared and
address us moA affably. He assigned us pensions,
giving me twelve thousand dinars a year, and added
two ^ages to the three he had already commanded
for me. One day he sent the wazlr and the governor
of Sind to us to say, ** The MaAcr of the World says
* Whoever amongA you is capable of undertaking the
funAion of wazlr or secretary or commander or judge
or professor or shaykh, I shall appoint to that office.’ ”
Everyone was silent at firA, tor what they were
wanting was to gain riches and return to their coun-
tries. After some of the others had spoken the wazlr
said to me jn Arabic “ What do you say ?” I replied
“ Wazlrships and secretaryships are not my business,
but as to qddls and shaykhs, that is my occupation,
and the occupation of my fathers before me.” The
sultan was pleased with what I had said, and I was
summoned to the palace to do homage on appoint-
ment as qddl of the Mdlikite rite at Delhi.

It happens often that there is a long delay in the
payment of the money gifts of 'the sultan (though they
arc always paid in the end) and I waited six months
207



SELECTIONS FROM THE

before receiving the twelve thousand dinars promised
to me. They have a cuilom also of deducing a
tenth from all sums given by the sultan. Now, as
I have related, I had borrowed from the merchants
for the expenses of my journey and my present to the
sultan, as well as for my residence at Delhi. When
they prepared to return to their country, they impor-
tuned me to pay my debts, so I wrote a long poem
in praise of the sultan and presented it to him. He
received it with pleasure, and I was congratulated by
everyone. After waiting for some time I wrote a
petition and transmitted it to the sultan, who ordered
the wazir tor pay my debts. The wazir delayed for
some days, and meanwhile received orders to proceed
to Dawlat Abad. During this time the sultan had
gone out hunting; the wazir set off, and I received
nothing at aU until some time later. When my
creditors were ready to travel I said to them “ When
I go to the palace, claim your debt from me according
to the cu^om in this country,” for I knew that when
the sultan learned of that he would pay them. Their
cu^om is this; the creditor awaits the debtor at the
door of the palace, and when the debtor is on the
point of entering he says to him “ O enemy of the
sultan, by the head of the sultan you shall not enter
until you have paid me.” The debtor may not leave
the place after that until he pays him or obtains a
delay from him. They did this, and the sultan sent
a chamberlain to ask the merchants the amount of
the debt. They replied “ Fifty-five thousand dinars.”
The sultan then sent the chamberlain to say to them
The Ma^er of the World says to you ‘ The money
is in my possession, and I shall give you justice; do
not demand it of him.’ ” He then commanded two
officers to sit in the H^ of the Thousand Columns
to examine and verify the creditors’ documents. They
found them in order and informed the sultan, who

208



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

laughed and said “ I know he is a qddi and has seen
to his business with them.” He then commanded
the treasurer to pay the sum, but the treasurer greedily
demanded a bribe for doing so and would not write
the order. I sent him two hundred tangahs, but he
returned them. One of his servants told me from
him that he wanted five hundred tangahs and I refused
to,pa^ it. The matter came to the cars of the sultan,
who in great displeasure ordered payment to be sus-
pended until the treasurer's condua was inveftigated.

Later on, when the sultan went out to hunt, I went
out along with him at once, as I had already prepared
all that is required according to the habits of the
Indians, and had hired bearers, grooms, valets, and
runners. One day when the sultan was in his tent
he enquired who were outside. Ndsir ad-DIn, one
of his courtiers, said “ So-and-so, the Moroccan, who
is very upset” Why so ?” asked the sultan, and
he replied ” Because of his debt, since his creditors
arc pressing for payment. The Maflcr of the World
had commanded the wazfr to pay it, but he left before
doing so. Would not the Mailer of the World order
the creditors to wait until the wazfr returns or else
give orders for their claims to be met ?” The “ king ”
Dawlat-Shdh, who was present, said “ O Mailer of
the World, every day this man talks to us in Arabic,
and I do not know what he is saying. 'Do you know,
Ndsir ad-Dfn ?” He said this so that Ndsir ad-Din
might repeat what he had said. Ndsir ad-Dfn answered
“ He talks about the debt which he has contradVed.”
The sultan said “ When we return to the capital, go
yourself to the treasury and give him this money.”
The treasurer was present and said “ O Mafler of
the World, he is very extravagant. I have seen him
before in our own land, at the court of Sultan
Tarmashfrin." After this the sultan invited me to
his meal, I being in total ignorance of what had taken
209 p



SELECTIONS FROM THE

place. As I went out Nasir ad-Dm said “ Thank
the king Dawlat-Shah,” and Dawlat-Shah said to me
“ Thank the treasurer.” The day after our return, I
went to the palace, and presented to the sultan two
camels with richly embroidered saddles and harness,
along with eleven plates of sweetmeats. He ordered
the sweetmeats to be taken into his private apartments
and on retiring to them sent for me. After we had
eaten he asked me the names of the sweetmeats which
he had particularly enjoyed, and thereafter we took
betel and withdrew. A few moments later the
treasurer came to me and said “ Send your friends
to receive the money,” so I sent them, and on return-
ing to my house after the sunset prayer found the
money there in three sacks, containing the fifty-five
thousand dinars which was the amount of my debt,
together with the twelve thousand which the sultan
had previously commanded to be paid to me, less
one-tenth according to their cu^om.

On the 9th of fir^ Jumada [21^ Oftober 1341]}
the sultan left Delhi for Maoar [Coromandel] to
fight with a rebel in that diftridt. I was all prepared
to accompany him, but was commanded with some
others to remain in. Delhi, and the chamberlain took
written acknowledgments of the order from us as
a proof that we had received it. The sultan also
commanded that I should take charge of the mauso-
leum of Sultan Qutb ad-Di'n. He then sent for
us to bid us farewell, and asked me if I had any
reque^s. I took out a piece of paper with six peti-
tions, but he said to me Speak with your tongue.”
Amongdl other things I said “ What shall I do about
the mausoleum of Sultan Qutb ad-Din ? I have
given appointments in connexion with it to four
hundred and sixty persons, and the income from its
endowment does not cover their salaries and food.”
He said to the wazir “ Fifty thousand ” and then

210

added ** You have an anticipatory crop.” This
means “ Give him a hundred thousand maunds of
wheat and rice to be expended during this year, until
the crops produced by the endowments come in.”
I asked also that my house might be repaired. When
I had been granted my requests, he said “There is
another recommendation, and that is that you incur
no debts and so avoid being pressed for payment, for
you will not find anyone to bring me news of them.
Kegulate your expenses according to what I have
given you, as God has said [in the Koran] Keep not
thy hand bound to thy neck^ neither open it to JuUeSl extent
and again Eat and drinky and be not prodigal^ I
desired to kiss his foot, but he prevented me and
held back my head with his hand, so I kissed that
and retired.

I returned to the capital and busied myself with
repairing my house; on this I spent four thousand
dinars, of which I received from the treasury six
hundred and paid the reit myself, I also built a
mosque opposite my house, and occupied myself
with the dispositions for the mausoleum of Sultan
Qutb ad'Din. The sultan had fixed the daily issue
of food there at twelve maunds of flour and a like
quantity of meat. I saw that this amount was too
small, and that the produce which the sultan had
put at my disposal was plcntifiJ, and consequently
I dispensed every day thirty-five maunds of flour and
thirty-five of meat, together with proportionate quan-
tities of sugar, candy, ghee and betel, not only to the
salaried employees but also to visitors and travellers.
The famine at that time was severe, but the popula-
tion were relieved by this food, and the news of it
spread far and wide. The “ King ” Sabfh, having
gone to join the sultan at Dawlat Abdd, was asked by
him for news of the doings of the people [in Delhi]
and answered “ If there were in Delhi two such men

2II



SELECTIONS FROM THE

as so-and-so there would be no complaints of famine.”
The sultan was pleased at this and sent me a robe
of honour from his own wardrobe.

On setting out for Ma‘bar [Coromandel] an epi-
demic broke out in the sultan’s army, so he returned
and built a camp near the river Ganges. I left Delhi
and joined him there, and remained with him through
the campaign against the rebel governor of Oudh. He
gave me some thoroughbred horses when di^ributing
them to his courtiers and included me in the number
of the latter. I was present with him at the battle
and capture of the rebel, and returned with him to
Delhi. Afterwards I fell into disfavour with him
because I 'had visited the shaykh Shihab ad-Dm in
his cave outside Delhi.^® He had thoughts of punish-
ing me and gave orders that four of his slaves should
remain con^antly beside me in the audience-hall.
When this a6tion is taken with anyone, it rarely happens
that he escapes. I fa^ed five days on end, reading
the Koran from cover to cover each day, and taking
nothing but water. After five days I broke my fa^
and then continued to fa^ for another four days on
end, and was set free after the shaykh’s death, praise
be to God.

Some time later I withdrew from the sultan’s service
and attached myself to the learned and pious imam
Kamal ad-Din “ The Cave Man,” as I have already
related. The sultan was in Sind at the time, and at
hearing of my retreat from the world summoned me.
I entered his presence dressed as a mendicant, and
he spoke to me very kindly, desiring me to return to
his service. I refused and asked him for permission
to travel to Mecca, which he granted. This was at
the end of second Jumada 742 [early December 1341].

Forty days later the sultan sent me saddled horses,
slave girls and boys, robes and a sum of money, so
1 put on the robes and went to him. I had a tunic

212



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

of blue cotton which I wore during my retreat, and
as I put it off and dressed in the sultan’s robes I
upbraided myself. Ever after when I looked at that
tunic I felt a light within me, and it remained in my
possession until the infidels despoiled me of it on the
sea. When I presented myself before the sultan,
he showed me greater favour than before, and said to
me I have sent for you to go as my ambassador
to the king of China, for I know your love of travel.”
He then provided me with everything I required and
appointed certain other persons to accompany me, as
I shall relate presently.

CHAPTER VII


The king of China had sent valuable gifts to the
sultan, including a hundred slaves of both sexes, five
hundred pieces of velvet and silk cloth, musk, jewelled
garments and weapons, with a request that the sultan
would permit him to rebuild the idol-temple which
is near the mountains called Qarajil [Himalaya]. It
is in a place known as Samhal, to which the Chinese
go on pilgrimage; the Muslim army in India had
captured it, laid it in ruins and sacked it.^ The
sultan, on receiving this gift, wrote to the king saying
that the reque^ could not be granted by Islamic law,
as permission to build a temple in the territories of
the Muslims was granted only to those who paid a
poll-tax; to which he added “ If thou wilt pay the
ji%ya we shall empower thee to build it. And peace
be on those who follow the True Guidance.” He
requited his present with an even richer one — a
hundred thoroughbred horses, a hundred white slaves,
a hundred Hindu dancing- and singing-girls, twelve
hundred pieces of various kinds of cloth, gold and
silver candelabra and basins, brocade robes, caps,
quivers, swords, gloves embroidered with pearls, and
fifteen eunuchs. As my fellow-ambassadors the
sultan appointed the amir Zahir ad-Di'n of Zanjan,
one of the moft eminent men of learning, and the
eunuch Kafdr, the cup-bearer, into whose keeping
the pt-esent was entru^ed. He sent the amir
Muhammad of Herat with a thousand horsemen to
escort us to the port of embarkation, and we were
accompanied by the Chinese ambassadors, fifteen in

214



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

number, along v^ith their servants, about a hundred
men in all.

We set out therefore in imposing force and formed
a large camp. Ihe sultan gave inArudions that we
v.crc to be supplied with provisions while we were
travelling through his dominions. Our journey bc|;an
on the 17th ot Safar 743 [llnd Julv 1342]. lhat
was the day sclcflcd ^causc they choose either the
2nd, 7th, 12th, t7th, 22nd, or 27th of the month
as the day for setting out. On the first day's journey
we halted at the |x>U-Aation of Tilbat, seven miles
from Delhi, and travelled thence through Bajdna, a
large and well-built town with a magnificent mosque,
to Kul [KocI, Aligarh], where we encamped in a wide
plain outside the town.

On reaching KocI we heard that certain Hindu
inlidcls had invcRcd and surrounded the town of
al-JaliU.* Now this town lies at a diRance of seven
miles from KocI, so we made in that dirc£lion. Mean-
while the inlidcls were engaged m batdc with its
inhabitants and the latter were on the verge of dcflruc-
tion. The infidels knew nothing of our approach
until we charged down upon them, though the)
numbered about a thousand cavalry and three thousand
foot, and we killed them to the laA man and took
possession of their horses and their weapons. Of our
party twent) -three horsemen and fifty-five foot-soldiers
suffered inartjrdom, amongA them the eunuch Kdfur,
the cup-bearer, into whose hands the present had been
entrusted. We informed the sultan by letter of his
death and halted to await his reply. During that
time the infidels used to swoop down from an inacces-
sible hill which IS in those parts and raid the environs
of al-Jaldlf, and our party used to ride out every day
with the commander of that didlridl to assi^ him in
driving them off.

On one of these occasions I rode out with several

215



SELECTIONS FROM THE

of my friends and we went into a garden to take our
sie^a, for this was in the hot season. Then we heard
some shouting, so we mounted our horses and over-
took some infidels who had attacked one of the villages
of al-Jalali. When we pursued them they broke up
into small parties; our troop in following them did
the same, and I was isolated with five others. At
this point we were attacked by a body of cavalry and
foot-soldiers from a thicket thereabouts, and we fled
from them because of their numbers. About ten of
them pursued me, but afterwards all but three of them
gave up the chase. There was no road at aU before
me and the ground there was very ftony. My horse’s
forefeet got caught between the ^ones, so I dis-
mounted, freed its foot and mounted again. It is
cu^omary for a man in India to carry two swords,
one, called the ^irrup-sword, attached to the saddle,
and the other in his quiver. My ifirrup-sword fell
out of its scabbard, and as its ornaments were of gold
I dismounted, picked it up, slung it on me and mounted,
my pursuers chasing me all the while. After this I
came to a deep nullah, so I dismounted and climbed
down to the bottom of it, and that was the la^ I saw
of them.

I came out of this into a valley amidst -a patch of
tangled wood, traversed by a road, so I walked along
it, not knowing where it led to. At this jundhire
about forty of the infidels, carrying bows in their
hands, came out upon me and surrounded me. I was
afraid that they would all shoot at me at once if I
fled from them, and I was wearing no armour, so I
threw myself to the ground and surrendered, as they
do not kill those who do that. They seized me and
Gripped me of everything that I was carrying except
a tunic, shirt and trousers, then they took me into
that patch of jungle, and finally brought me to the part
of it where they stayed, near a tank of water situated

2i6



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

among^l those trees. They gave me bread made of
peas, and I ate some of it and drank some water. In
their company there were two Muslims who spoke
to me in Persian, and asked me all about myself. I
told them part of my ^lory, but concealed the faft
that I had come from the Sultan, Then they said to
me: “ You are sure to be put to death either by these
men or by others, but this man here (pointing to one
of them) is their leader.” So I spoke to him, using
the two Muslims as interpreters, and tried to con-
ciliate him. He gave me in charge of three of the
band, one of them an old man, with whom was his
son, and the third an evil black fellow. These three
spoke to me and I undei^ood from them that they
had received orders to kill me. In the evening of
the same day they carried me off to a cave, but God
sent an ague upon the black, so he put his feet upon
me, and the old mah and his son went to sleep. In
the morning they talked among themselves and made
signs to me to accompany them down to the tank.
I realized that they were going to kill me, so I spoke
to the old man and tried to gain his favour, and he
took pity on me. I cut off the sleeves of my shirt
and gave them to him so that the other members of
the band should not blame him on my account if I
escaped.

About noon we heard voices near the tank and they
thought that it was their comrades, so they made
signs to me to go down with them, but when we went
down we found some other people. The newcomers
advised my guards to accompany them but they refused,
and the three of them sat down in front of me, keeping
me facing them, and laid on the ground a hempen
rope which they had with them. I was watching them
all the time and saying to myself: “ It is with this
rope that they will bind me when they kill me.” I
remained thus for a time, then three of their party,
217



SELECTIONS FROM THE

the party that had captured me, came up and spoke
to them and I underwood that they said to them:
“ Why have you not killed him ?” The old man
pointed to the black, as though he were excusing
himself on the ground of his illness. One of these
three was a pleasant-looking youth, and he said to
me : “ Do you wish me to set you at liberty ?” I said
“ Yes,” and he answered “ Go.” So I took the tunic
which I was wearing and gave it to him and he gave
me a worn double-woven cloak which he had, and
showed me the way. I went off but I was afraid le^
they should change their minds and overtake me, so
I went into a reed thicket and hid there till sunset.

'Then I made my way out and followed the road
which the youth had shewn me. This led to a ^ream
from which I drank. I went on till near midnight
and came to a hill under which I slept. In the
morning I continued along the 'road, and sometime
before noon reached a high rocky hill on which there
were sweet lote-trees and zizyphus bushes. I Parted
to pull and eat the lotus berries so eagerly that the
thorns left scars on my arms that remain there to this
day. Coming down from that hill I entered a plain
sown with cotton and containing: ca^or-oil trees.
Here there was a hd'in^ which in their language means
a very broad well with a ^one casing and ^eps by
which you go down to reach the water. Some of
them have ^hone pavilions, arcades, and seats in the
centre and on the sides, and the kings and nobles of
the country vie with one another in con^rudling them
dong the highroads where there is no water. When
I reached the bdi^in I drank some water from it and I
found on it some mudiard shoots which had been
dropped by their owner when he washed them. Some
of these I ate and saved up the red:, then I lay down
under a cador-oil tree. While I was there about
forty mailed horsemen came to the bdHn to get water

218



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

and some of them entered, the sown fields, then they
went away, and God sealed their eyes that they did
not see me. After them came about fifty others
carrying arms and they too went down into the bd'in.
One of them came up to a tree opposite the one I
was under, yet he did not discover me. At this point
I made my way into the field of cotton and flayed
there the re^l of the day, while they flayed at the
ba'in washing their clothes and whiling away the
time. At night time their voices died away, so I
knew that they had either passed on or fallen asleep.
Thereupon I emerged and followed the track of the
horses, for it was a moonlit night, continuing till I
came to another bd^in with a dome over it. I went
down to it, drank some water, ate some of the mu^rd
shoots which I had, and went into the dome. I
found it full of grasses collefted by birds, so I went
to sleep in it. Now and again I felt the movement
of an animal amongft the grass; 1 suppose it was
a shake, but I was too worn out to pay any attention
to it.

The next morning I went along a broad road,
which led to a ruined village. Then I took another
road, but with the same result as before. Several
days passed in this manner. One day I came to
some tangled trees with a tank of water between them.
The space under these trees was like a room, and at
the sides of the tank were plants like dittany and
others. I intended to ^lop there until God should
send someone to bring me to inhabited country, but
I recovered a little ^rength, so I arose and wdked
along a road on which I found the tracks of cattle.
I found a bull carrying a packsaddle and a sickle,
but after all this road led to the villages of the infidels.
Then I followed up another road, and this brought
me to a ruined village. There I saw two naked
blacks, and in fear of them I remained under some
219



SELECTIONS FROM THE

trees there. At nightfall I entered the village and
found a house in one of whose rooms there was some-
thing like a large jar of the sort they make to ^ore
grain in. At the bottom of it there was a hole large
enough to admit a man, so I crept info it and found
inside it a layer of chopped ^traw, and among^ this
a ^one on which I laid my head and went to sleep.
On the top of the jar there was a bird which kept
fluttering its wings mo^ of the night — I suppose it
was frightened, so we made a pair of frightened
creatures. This went on for seven days from the
day on which I was taken prisoner, which was a
Saturday. On the seventh day I came to a village
of the unbelievers which was inhabited and possessed
a tank of water and plots of vegetables. I asked them
for some food but they refused to give me any. How-
ever, in the neighbourhood of a well I found some
radish leaves and ate them. I went into the village,
and found a troop of infidels with sentries polled.
The sentries challenged me but I did not answer them
and sat down on the ground. One of them came over
with a drawn sword and raised' it to ^rike me, but
I paid no attention to him, so utterly weary did I feel.
Then he searched me but found nothing on me, so
he took the shirt whose sleeves I had given to the
old man who had had charge of me.

On the eighth day I was consumed with thir^ and
I had no water at all; I came to a ruined village but
found no tank in it. They have a cu^om in those
villages of making tanks in which the rain-water
colledls, and this supplies them with drinking water
aU the year round. Then I went along a road and
this brought me to an uncased well over which was
a rope of vegetable fibre, but there was no vessel on
it to draw water with. I took a piece of cloth which
I had on my head and tied it to the rope and sucked
the water that soaked into it, but that did not slake

220



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

my thiril. I tied on my shoe next and drew up water
in it, but that did not satisfy me either, so I drew
water with it a second time, but the rope broke and
the shoe fell back into the well. I then tied on the
other shoe and drank until my thit^ was assuaged.
After that I cut the shoe and tied its uppers on my
foot with the rope off the well and bits or cloth which
I found there. While I was tying this on and wonder-
ing what to do, a person appeared before me. I
looked at him, and lol it was a black-skinned man,
carrying a jug and a ^aff in his hand, and a wallet on
his shoulder. He gave me the Muslim greeting
“ Peace be upon you ** and I replied “ Upon you be
pcrcc and the mercy and blessings of God.” Then
ne asked me in Persian who I was, and I answered
“ A man ailray,” and he said: ” So am I.” Thereupon
he tied his jug to a rope which he had with him and
drew up some water. I wished to drink but he
saying “Have patience,” opened his wallet and brought
out a handful of black chick-peas fried with a little
rice. After I had eaten some of this and drunk, he
made his ablutions and prayed two proilrations and I
did the same. Thereupon he asked me my name.
1 answered ^ Muhammad ” and asked him his, to
which he replied “Joyous Heart.” I took this as
a good omen and rejoiced at it. After this he said
to me “ In the name of God accompany me." I said
“ Yes," and walked on with him for a litdc, then I
found my limbs giving way, and as I was unable to
fland up I sat down. He said “ What is the matter
with you ?" I answered “ I was able to walk before
meeting you, but now that I have met you I cannot.”
Whereupon he said “ Glory be to God ! Mount on
my shoulders.” I said to him “ You are weak, and
hpc not Arength for tha^” but he replied “ God will
give me Arength. You muA do so." So I got up
on his shoulders and he said to me “ Say God is sufficient
221



SELECTIONS FROM THE

for us and an excellent guardian^ I repeated this over
and over again, but I could not keep my eyes open,
and regained consciousness only on feeling myself
falling to the ground. Then I woke up, but found
no trace of the man, and lo ! I was in an inhabited
village. I entered it and found it was a village of
Hindu peasants with a Muslim governor. They
informed him about me and he came to meet me.
I asked him the name of this village and he replied
“ Taj Bura.” The di^ance from there to Koel,
where our party was, is two farsakhs. The governor
provided a horse to take me to his house ^nd gave-
me hot food, and I washed. Then he said to me;
“ I have here a garment and a turban which were
left in my charge by a certain Arab from Egypt, one
of the soldiers belonging to the corps at Koel.” I
said to him “ Bring them ; I shall wear them until I
reach camp.” When he brought them I found that
they were two of my own garments which I had given
to that very Arab when we came to Koel. I was
extremely a^onished at this, then I thought of the
man who had carried me on his shoulders and I
remembered what the saint Abu ‘Abdallah al-Murshidi
had told me, as I have related in the fir^ journey,
when he said to me: “ You will enter the land of India
and meet there my brother Dilshad, who will deliver
you from a misfortune which .will befall you there.”

I remembered too how he had said, when I asked
him his name, “ Joyous Heart ” which, translated
into Persian, is Dilshad. So I knew that it was he
whom the saint had foretold that I should meet, and
that he too was one of the saints, but I enjoyed no
more of his company than the short space which I
have related.

The same night I wrote to my friends at Koel to
inform them of my safety, and they came, bringing
me a horse and clothes and rejoiced at my escape.

222



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

I found that the sultan's reply had reached them and
that he had sent a eunuch named Sunbul, the keeper
of the wardrobe, in place of the martyred Kafdr, with
orders to pursue our journey. I found, too, that they
had written to the sultan about me, and that they
regarded the journey as ill-omened on account of
what had happened to me and to Kdfiir, and were
wanting to go back. But when I saw that the sultan
insidled upon the journey, I urged them on with great
determination. They answered: “Do you not see
what has befallen us at the very outset of this mission ^
The sultan will excuse you, so let us return to him,
or dlay here until his reply reaches us.” But I said:
“ We cannot dlay, and wherever we are his reply will
overtake us.”

We left Koel, therefore, and encamped at Burj
Bdra [Burjpur], where there is a fine hermitage in
which lives a beautiful and virtuous shaykh called
Muhammad the Naked, because he wears nothing
but a cloth from his navel to the ground. Thence
we travelled to the river known as [“Black

Water,” Kalindi] and from there reached the city of
Qinawj [Kanauj], It is a large, well-built and dlrongly
fortified city; prices there are cheap and sugar plentiful,
and it is surrounded by a great wall. We spent three
days here and during this time received the sultan’s
reply to the letter about me. It ran thus “ If no
trace is found of so-and-so [i.e. Ibn Battdta], let
Wajih al-Mulk, the qSdf of Dawlat Abad, go in his
place.” We came next to the small town of Mawrl, and
thence reached Marh, a large town, inhabited chiefly
by infidels under Muslim control.® It takes its name
from the Malawa, a tribe of Hindus, of very powerful
build and good-looking; their women especially are
exceedingly beautiful and famous for the charms of
their company. From Math we travelled to ‘Alabdr
[Alapur], a small town inhabited like the former by
223



SELECTIONS FROM THE

infidels under Muslim control. A day’s journey from
there lived an infidel sultan, named Qatam, who was
sultan of Janbil** and was killed after besieging Guya-
lyur [Gwalior]. The governor of ‘Alabiir was the
Abyssinian Badr, a slave of the sultan’s, a man whose
bravery passed into a proverb. He was continually
making raids on the infidels alone and single handed,
killing and taking captive, so that his fame spread
far and wide and the infidels went in fear of him. He
was tall and corpulent, and used to eat a whole sheep
at a meal, and I was told that after eating he would
drink about a pound and a half of ghee, following
the custom of the Abyssinians in their own country.
He had a son nearly as brave as himself. During
a raid on a village belonging to some Hindus Badr’s
horse fell with him into a matamore and the villagers
surrounded him and killed him.

We journeyed thereafter to Galyiar or Guyalyur
[Gwalior], a large town with an impregnable fortress
isolated on the summit of a lofty hill. Over its gate
is an elephant with its mahout carved in ^one. The
governor of this town was a man of upright character,
and he treated me very honourably when I stayed
with him on a previous occasion. One day I came
before him as he was about to have an infidel cut in
two. I said to him “ By God I beseech you, do not
do this, for I have never seen anyone put to death
in my presence.” He ordered the man to be put in
prison so my intervention was the means of his escape.
From Galyiir we went to Parwan, a small town belong-
ing to the Muslims, but situated in the land of the
infidels. There are many tigers there, and one of the
inhabitants told me that a certain tiger used to enter
the town by night, although the gates were shut, and
used to seize people. It killed quite a number of
the townsfolk in this way. They used to wonder how
it made its way in. Here is an amazing thing; a

224



TRAVELS OF I U N BATTOTA

nun toM me that it was not a tiger who did this but
a human being, one of the magicians known as 'Jugis
[Yogis], appearing in the shape of a tiger. When I
heard this 1 refused to believe it, but a number of
people said the same, so let us give at this point some
account of these magicians.

The men of this class do some marvellous things.
One of them will spend months without eating or
drinking, and many of them have holes dug for them
in the earth which arc then built in on top of them,
leaving only a apace for air to enter. Thev Ray in
these for months, and t heard tell of one of them who
remained thus for a year. 'Vhc people sav that they
make up pills, one of which they take lor a given
number ot days or months, and during that lime
they require no food or drink. They can tell what is
happening at a diRance. The sultan holds them in
cReem and admits them to his company. Some cat
nothing but vegetables, and others, the maiority, cat
no meat; it is obvious (hat they have so disciplined
themselves in ascetic praRiccs that they have no need
of any of the goods or vanities of this world. There
are amongR them some who merely look at a man
and he falls dead on the spot. The common people
say that if the breoR of a man killed in this way is
cut open, it is found to contain no heart, and they
assert that his heart has been eaten. This is com*
moncR in the ease of women, and a woman who aRs
thus is called a kjfrJr, During the famine in Delhi
they brought one of these women to me, saying that
she had eaten the heart of a boy. I ordered them to
take her to the sultan's lieutenant, who commanded
that she should be put to the tcR. They filled four
jars with water, tied them to her hands and feet and
threw her into the river Jumna. As she did not
sink she was known to be a htjtdr\ had she not floated
she would not have been one. He ordered her then
225 Q



selections from the

to be burned ashes were collefted

by the men ar’^^ women of the town, for they believe
that anyone fumigates himself with them is safe
again^ a kaft^^ enchantments during that year.

The sultan once when I was at Delhi,

and on entering ^ found him in a private apartment
with some intimates and two of these jugis.

One of them squatted on the ground, then rose into
the air abov® heads, ^ill sitting. I w^s so
a^onished an^ frightened that I feU to the floor in
a faint. A potion was admini^ered to me, and I
revived and ^P* Meantime this man remained
in his sitting po^ure. His companion then took a
sandal from a- with him, and beat it on the

ground like infuriated. The sandal rose in the
air until it caP^^ above the neck of the sitting man and
then began neck while he descended

little by litde sat down alongside us. Then

the sultan sa^<^ ^ *^ot fear for your reason I

would have ordered them to do ^ill Granger things
than this yoP seen.” I took my leave, but was
affefted with palpitation and fell ill, until he ordered
me to be givP^ s. draught which removed it all.

To return °rir subject. We went from Parwan
to Kajarra,® where there is a large tank about a mile
long having on its banks temples with idols, which
have been ipade examples of [i.e. mutilated] by the
Muslims. Thence we journeyed through Chandiri
to the town Dhihar [Dhar],® which is the chief
city of Mal'^^j larged province in that di^ridt.
It is twenty'Tour days’ journey from Delhi, and all
along the rOad between them there are pillars, on
which is eflgraved the number of miles from each
pillar to tho next. When the traveller desires to
know now r^oany miles he has gone that day and how
far it is to hi® hdting place or to the. town he is making
for, he rea4® ^he inscription on the pillars and so

finds out. From Dhihdr wc travelled to Ujayn
[Ujjain], a fine and populous town, and thence to
Dawlat Abdd, the enormous city which rivals Delhi,
the capital, in importance and in the spaciousness of
its planning. It is divided into three se£Uons; one
is Dawlat Abld proper, and is reserved for the sultan
and his troops, the second is called Kataka, and the
third is the citadel, which is unequalled for its dlrength
and is called Duwaygir fpeogirij.^

At Dawlat Abdd resides the great khdn Qutld
Khdn, the sultan’s tutor, who is governor of the town,
and the sultan’s representative there and in the lands
of Sdghar, Tiling [Tclingana], and their dependent
territories. This province extends for three months’
march, is weU>populatcd, and wholly under his autho-
rity and that or his lieutenants. The fortress of
Duwaygir mentioned above is a rock situated in a
plain; £e rock has been excavated and a caiUe built
on its summit. It is reached by a ladder made of
leather, which is taken up at night. In its dungeons
arc imprisoned those convifled of serious crime, and
in these dungeons there are huge rats, bigger than
cats — in fa£l, cats run away from them and cannot
defend themselves againdl them, so they can be cap^
tured only by employing ruses. I saw them there
and marvelled at them. The inhabitants of Dawlat
Abdd belong to the tribe of Marhata [Marathas],
whose women God has endowed with special beauty,
particularly in their noses and eyebrows. The infidels
of this town arc merchants, dealing principally in
jewels, and their wealth is enormous. In Dawlat
Abdd there is an exceedingly fine and spacious bazaar
for singers and singing-girls, containing numerous
shops, each of which has a door leading to the house
of its proprietor. The shop is beautified with
carpets, ana in the centre of it there is a sort of large
cradle on which the singing-girl sits or reclines. She

the ships tlicrc lying on the mud at ebb-tide and floating
on the water at high tide. This city is one of the
fineft there is in regard to the excellence of its con-
^Iruftion and the architecture of its mosques. The
reason is that the majority of its inhabitants are foreign
merchants, who arc always building fine mansions and
magnificent mosques and vie with one another in
doing so. We journeyed from this town to Kdwd,®
which is on a tidal bay also, and is in the territories
of the infidel rdja Jdlansf, of whom we shall speak
later. Thence we went to Qandahdr, a large town
belonging to the infidels and situated on a bay.
The sultan of Qandahdr is an infidel called Jdlansl,
who is under Muslim suzerainty and sends a gift
to the king of India every year.*® When we reached
Qandahdr he came out to welcome us and showed us
the greatcA honour, himself leaving his palace and
•installing us in it. The principal Muslims at his
court came to visit us, such as the children of the
Khwdja Bohra. One of these is the shipowner Ibrdhim,
who possesses six vessels of his own.

At Qandahdr we embarked on a ship belonging
to this Ibrdhim, called al~Jdgir, On this ship we put
seventy of the horses of the sultan’s present, and the
redl we put with the horses of our companions on a
ship belonging to Ibrdhlm’s brother, called Manurt.
Jdlansl gave us a vessel on which we put the horses
of Zahlr ad-Dln and Sunbul and their party, and he
equipped it for us with water, provisions and forage.
He sent his son with us on a ship called al^Uqayriy
which resembles a galley, but is rather broader; it
has sixty oars and is covered with a roof during battle
in order to proteCt the rowers from arrows and Clones.
I myself went on board al-Jdgir, which had a com-
plement of fifty rowers and fifty Abyssinian men-at-
arms. These latter are the guarantors of safety on
the Indian Ocean; let there be but one of them on

a ship and it will be avoided by the Indian pirates and
idolaters. Two days later we called at the island of
Bayram,^^ and on the following day reached the town
of Quqa [Gogo, in Kathiawar], a large town with
important bazaars. We anchored four miles from
shore on account of the low tide, but I went on shore
in a small boat with some of my companions. The
sultan of Qdqa is a heathen called Dunqiil, who used
to profess submission to the king of India but was in
reality a rebel. On setting sail from this town we
arrived after three days at the island of Sandabiir
[Goa],^ on which there are thirty-six villages. It is
surrounded by a gulf, the waters of which are sweet and
agreeable at low tide but salt and bitter at high tide.
In the centre of the island are two cities, an ancient
one built by the infidels, and one built by the Muslims
when they fir^ captured the island. We passed by
this island and anchored at a smaller one near the main-
land. Next day we reached the town of Hinawr
[Honavar, Onore], which is on a large inlet navigable
for large ships. During th&pushkdl, which is the rainy
season, this bay is so ^ormy that for four months it
is impossible to sail on it except for fishing. The
women of this town and all the coa^al di^rifts wear
nothing but loose unsewn garments, one end of which
they gird round their wai^s, and drape the re^ over
their head and shoulders. They are beautiful and
virtuous, and each wears a gold ring in her nose.
One peculiarity among^ them is that they all know
the Koran by heart. I saw in the town thirteen
schools for girls and twenty-three for boys, a thing
which I have never seen elsewhere. Its inhabitants
live by maritime commerce, and have no cultivated
land. ^ The ruler of Hinawr is Sultan Jalal ad-Dm,
who^ is one of the be^l and mo^l powerful sultans.
He is under the suzerainty of an infidel sultan named
Haryab, of whom we shall speak later. The people

230

of Mulaybdr [Malabar] pay a fixed sum annually to
Sultan Jaldl ad-Dln, through fear of his sea-power.
His army is composed of about six thousand men,
horse and foot. On another occasion I dlayed for
eleven months at his court without ever eating bread,
for their sole food is rice. I lived also in the Maidive
Islands, Ceylon, and on the Coromandel and Malabar
coa^s for three years eating nothing but rice, until I
could not swallow it except by taking water with it.
On this occasion we dlayea with the sultan of Hinawr
for three days; he supplied us with provisions, and we
left him to continue our journey.

Three days later we reached the land of Mulaybdr
[Malabar], which is the pepper country. It extends
for two months* journey along the coail from Sandabdr
[Goa] to Kawlam [Quilon, in Travancore], The road
over the whole di^ance runs beneath the shade of
trees, and at every half-mile there is a wooden shed
with benches on which all travellers, whether Muslims
or infidels, may sit. At each shed there is a well for
drinking and an infidel who is in charge of it. If
the traveller is an infidel he gives him water in vessels;
if he is a Muslim he pours the water into his hands,
continuing to do so until he signs to him to ilop. It
is the cuftom of the infidels in the Mulaybdr lands
that no Muslim may enter their houses or eat from
their vessels; if he does so they break the vessels or
give them to the Muslims, In places where there are
no Muslim inhabitants they give him food on banana
leaves. At all the halting-places on this road there
are houses belonging to Muslims, at which Muslim
travellers alight, and where they buy all that they
need. Were it not for them no Muslim could travel
by it.

On this road, which, as we have said, extends for
a two months* march, there is not a foot of ground
but is cultivated. Every man has his own orchard,
231



SELECTIONS FROM THE

with his house in the middle and a wooden palisade
all round it. The road runs through the orchards,
and when it comes to a palisade there are wooden
^eps to go up by and another flight of ^eps down into
the next orchard. No one travels on a animal in that
country, and only the sultan possesses horses. The
princip^ vehicle of the inhabitants is a palanquin
carried on the shoulders of slaves or hired porters;
those who do not travel on palanquins go on root, be
they who they may. Baggage and merchandise is
transported by hired carriers, and a single merchant
may have a hundred such or thereabouts carrying his
goods. I have never seen a safer road than this, for
they put to death anyone who steals a single nut, and
if any fruit falls no one picks it up but the owner.
Indeed we sometimes met infidels during the night
on this road, and when they saw us they ^ood aside
to let us pass. Muslims are mo^ highly honoured
among^ them, except that, as we have. said, they do
not eat with them nor allow them into their houses. In
the Mulaybar lands there are twelve infidel sultans,
some of them strong with armies numbering fifty
thousand men, and others weak with armies of three
thousand. Yet there is no discord whatever between
them, and the strong does not desire to seize the
possessions of the weak. At the boundary of the
territories of each ruler there is a wooden gateway,
on which is engraved the name of the ruler whose
territories begin at that point. This is called the
“ Gate of Security ” of such-and-such a prince. If
any Muslim or infidel criminal flees from the terri-
tories of one and reaches the Gate of Security of
another, his life is safe, and the prince from whom he
has fled cannot seize him, even though he be a powerful
prince .with a great army. The riders in these lands
transmit their sovereignty to their sixers’ sons, to
the exclusion of their own children. I have seen this

232

pra£ticc nowhere else except among the veiled Massufa,
who will be mentioned later.

The firil town in the land of Mul:wbdr that we
entered was the town of Abu-Sanir [Barcclore], a
small place on a large inlet and abounding in coco-
palms. Two days* journey brought us to Fdkaniir
[Bacanor, now Barkur],“ a large town on an inlet;
here there is a large quantity of sugar-canes, which
are unexcelled in the r^ of that country. The chief
of the Muslim community at Fdkanur is called
Bdsadaw. He possesses about thirty warships, com-
manded by a Muslim called Liild, who is an evildoer
and a pirate and a robber of merchants. When we
anchored, the sultan sent his son to us to Aay on board
the ship as a hoRage. We went on shore to visit
him and he treated us with the utmo^ hospitality for
three nights, as a mark of resped^ for the sultan of
India and also from a desire to make some profit by
trading with the personnel of our vessels. It is a
cuRom of theirs that every ship that passes by a town
muR needs anchor at it and give a present to the ruler.
This they call the “ right of bandar'^ If anyone
omits to do this, they sail out in pursuit of him, bring
him into the port by force, double the tax on him,
and prevent him from proceeding on his journey for
as long as they wish. Three days after leaving
Fdkandr wc reached Manjanir [Mangalore], a large
town on the inlet called ad-Dumb, which is the largest
inlet in the land of Mulaybdr, This is the town at
which moil of the merchants from Firs and Yemen
disembark, and pepper and ginger are exceedingly
abundant there. The sultan of Manjarur is one of
the principal rulers in that land, and his name is Rdma
Daw. There is a colony of about four thousand
Muslims there, living in a suburb alongside the town.
Confli<5ls frequently break out between them and the
townspeople, but the sultan makes peace between them

233



SELECTIONS FROM THE

on account of his need of the merchants. We refused
to land until the sultan sent his son, as the previous
sultan had done. When he had done so, we went
on shore and were treated with great consideration.

After laying at Manjariir for three days, we set
sail for the town of Hili,^‘^ which we reached two days
later. It is large and well-built, situated on a big
inlet which is navigable for large vessels. This is the
farthest town reached by ships from China; they enter
only this port, the port of Kawlam, and Calicut. The
town of Hill is venerated by both Muslims and in-
fidels on account of its cathedral mosque, and sea-
farers make many votive offerings to it. This mosque
contains a number of ^udents, who receive ^ipends
from its revenues, and it has a kitchen from which
travellers and the Muslim poor are supplied with
food. Thence we sailed to Jurfattan [Cannanore],
Dahfattan, and Budfattan; the sultan of these towns
is called Kuwayl, and is one of the mo^t powerful
sultans of Mulaybar. At Dahfattan there is a great
hd^hi and a cathedral mosque, which were built by
Kuwayl’s grandfather, who was converted to Islam.
Moft of the inhabitants of Budfattan are Brahmans,
who are venerated by the infidels and who hate the
Muslims; for this reason there are no Muslims living
among^ them. From Budfattan we sailed to Fanda-
rayna [Panderani], a large and fine town with orchards
and bazaars. The Muslims occupy three quarters in
it, each of which has a mosque. It is at this town that
the Chinese vessels pass the winter. Thence we
travelled to the city of Qaliqfit [Calicut], which is
one of the chief ports in Miilaybar and one of the
larged harbours in the world. It is visited by men
from China, Sumatra, Ceylon, the Maldives, Yemen
and Fars, and in it gather merchants from all quarters.^®
The sultan of Caliciit is an infidel, known as “ the
Samari.” He is an aged man and shaves his beard,

234



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

as some of the Greeks do. In this town too lives
the famous shipowner Mithqdl, who possesses
wealth and many ships for his trade with India, China,
Yemen, and Pars. When we reached the city, the
principal inhabitants and merchants and the sultan’s
representative came out to welcome us, with drums,
trumpets, bugles and ^landards on their ships. We
entered the harbour in great pomp, the like of which
I have never seen in those lands, but it was a joy to
be followed by distress. We flopped in the port of
Cdlicdt, in which there were at the time thirteen
Chinese vessels, and disembarked. Every one of us
was lodged in a house and we ^ayed there three months
as the gucAs of the infidel, awaiting the season of the
voyage to China. On the Sea of China travelling is
done in Chinese ships only, so we shall describe their
arrangements.

The Chinese vessels arc of three kinds; large ships
called chunks^ middle-sized ones called zaws phows],
and small ones called The large ships have

anything from twelve down to three sails, which are
made of bamboo rods plaited like mats. They are
never lowered, but turned according to the direction
of the wind; at anchor they are left floating in the
wind. A ship carries a complement of a thousand
men, six hundred of whom arc sailors and four hundred
men-at-arms, including archers, men with shields and
arballAs, who throw naphtha. Each large vessel is
accompanied by three smaller ones, the “ half,” the
“ thircl,” and the “ quarter.”*^ These vessels are
built only in the towns of Zaytdn and Sin-Kaldn
[Canton]. The vessel has four decks and contains
rooms, cabins, and saloons for merchants; a cabin
has chambers and a lavatory, and can be locked by
its occupant, who takes along with him slave girls
and wives. Often a man will Jive in his cabin unknown
to any of the others on board until they meet on

reaching some town. The sailors have their children
living on board ship, and they cultivate green ^ufFs,
vegetables and ginger in wooden tanks. The owner’s
fadtor on board ship is like a great amir. When he
goes on shore he is preceded by archers and Abys-
sinians with javelins, swords, drums, trumpets and
bugles. On reaching the house where he ^ays they
^and their lances on both sides of the door, and
continue thus during his ^ay. Some of the Chinese
own large numbers of ships on which their fa6tors
are sent to foreign countries. There is no people in
the world wealthier than the Chinese.

When the time came for the voyage to China, the
sultan Samari equipped for us one of the thirteen
junks in the port of Caliciit. The fadlor on the junk
was called Sulayman of Safad, in Syria [Pale^ine].
I had previously made his acquaintance, and I said to
him “ I want a cabin to myself because of the slave-
girls, for it is my habit never to travel without them.”
He replied “ The merchailts from China have taken
the cabins for the forward and return journey. My
son-in-law has a cabin which I can give you, but it
has no lavatory; perhaps you may be able to exchange
it for another.” So I told my companions to take on
board all my effefts, and the male and female slaves
embarked on the junk. This was on a Thursday,
and I flayed on shore in order to attend the Friday
prayers and join them afterwards. The king Sunbul
and Zahir ad-Di'n also went on board with the present.
On the Friday morning a slave boy of mine named
Hilal came to me and said that the cabin we had taken
on the junk was small and unsuitable. When I
spoke of this to the captain he said “ It cannot be
helped, but if you like to transfer to the kakam there
are cabins on it at your choice.” I agreed to this
and gave orders accordingly to my companions, who
transferred the slave girls and effedts to the kakam

236



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

and were cAablishcd in it before the hour of the
Friday prayer. Now it is usual for this sea to become
Aormy ever)* day in the late aftcrnoon> and no one
can embark then. The junks had already set sail,
and none of them were left but the one which con*
tained the present, another junk whose owner had
decided to pass the winter at Fandaraynd, and the
kakam referred to. We spent the Friday night on
shore, we unable to embark on it, and those on board
unable to disembark and join us. I had nothing left
with me but a carpet to sleep on. On the Saturday
morning the junk and kakam were both at a diAance
from the port, and the junk which was to have made
for Fandarayni was driven ashore and broken in
pieces. Some of those who were on board were
drowned and some escaped. That night the same
fate met the junk which carried the sultan's present,
and all on board were drowned. Next morning we
found the bodies of Sunbul and Zihlr ad-Din, and
having prayed over them buried them. I saw the
inlidcl, the sultan of Cdlicdt, wearing a large white
cloth round his wai^l and a small turban, bare-footed,
with the parasol carried by a slave over his head and
a fire lit in front of him on the beach; his police officers
were beating the people to prevent them from plunder-
ing what the sea cail up. In all the lands of Mulaybdr,
except in this one land alone, it is the cuSiom that when-
ever a ship is wrecked all that is taken from it belongs
to the treasury. At Cdlicfit however it is retained
by its owners and for that reason Cdlicut has become
a flourishing city and attrafts large numbers of mer-
chants. When those on the kakam saw what had
h^pened to the junk they spread their sails and went
off, with all my goods and slave-boys and slave-girls
on board, leaving me alone on the beach with but
one slave whom I had enfranchised. When he saw
what had befallen me he deserted me, and I had

237



SELECTIONS FROM THE

nothing left with me at all except ten dinars and the
carpet I had slept on.

As I was told that the kakam would have to put
in at Kawlam, I decided to travel thither, it being a
ten days’ journey either by land or by the river, if
anyone prefers that route. I set out therefore by the
river, and hired one of the Muslims to carry the carpet
for me. Their custom is to disembark in the evening
and pass the night in the village on its banks, returning
to the boat in the morning. We did this too. There
was no Muslim on the boat except the man I had
hired, and he used to drink wine with the infidels
when we went ashore and annoy me with his brawling,
which made things all the worse for me. On the fifth
day of our journey we came to Kunja-Kari which is
on the top of a hill there; it is inhabited by Jews, who
have one of their own number as their governor, and
pay a polltax to the sultan of Kawlam. All the trees
along this river are cinnamon and brazil trees. They
use them for firewood in those parts and we used to
light fires with them to cook our food on this journey.
On the tenth day we reached the city of Kawlam
[Quilon], one of the fine^ towns in the Mulaybar
lands. It has fine bazaars, and its merchants are
called SfiKs. They are immensely wealthy; a single
merchant will buy a vessel with dl that is in it and
load it with goods from his own house. There is a
colony of Muslim merchants; the cathedral mosque is
a magnificent building, con^rufted by the merchant
Khwaja Muhazzab. This city is the neared of the
Mulaybar towns to China and it is to it that mo^
of the merchants [from China] come. Muslims are
honoured and respedled in it. The sultan of Kawlam
is an infidel called the Tirawari; he respedls the
Muslims and has severe laws again^ thieves and
profligates. I stayed some time at Kawlam in a
hospice, but heard no news of the kakam. During my

238



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

^lay the ambassadors from the king of China who had
been with us arrived there also. They had embarked on
one of the junks which was wrecked like the others.
The Chinese merchants provided them with clothes and
they returned to China, where I met them again later.

I intended at fir^i to return from Kawlam to the
sultan to tell him what had happened to the present,
but afterwards I was afraid that he would Hnd fault
with what I had done and ask me why I had not ^ayed
with the present. I determined therefore to return
to Sultan Jamdl ad'Din of Hinawr and dlay with him
until I should obtain news of the kakam. So I went
back to Cdlicilt and found there a vessel belonging
to the sultan [of India], on which I embarked. It
was then the end of the season for voyaging, and we
used to sail only during the first half of the day, then
anchor until the next day. We met four fighting
vessels on our way and were afraid of them, but after
all they did us no harm. On reaching Hinawr, I
went to the sultan and saluted him; he assigned me
a lodging, but without a servant, and asked me to
recite the prayers with him. I spent moil of my time
in the mosque^® and used to read the Koran through
every day, and later twice a day.

Sultan Jamdl ad-Dfn had fitted out fifty-two vessels
for an expedition to SandabUr [Goa]. A quarrel had
broken out there between the sultan and his son, and
the latter had written to Jamdl ad-Din inviting him
to seize the town and promising to accept Isldm and
marry his daughter. When the ships were made
ready I thought of setting out with them to the Holy
War, so I opened the Koran to take an augury, and
found at the top of the page In them is the name of God
frequently mentioned^ and verily God will aid those who
aid Him. I took this as a good omen, and when
the sultan came for the afternoon prayer I said to
him “ I wish to join the expedition.” “ In that case ”

239



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

he replied “ you will be their commander.” I related
to him the incident of my augury from the Koran,
which so delighted him that he resolved to join the
expedition himself, though previously he had not
intended to do so. He embarked on one of the vessels,
I being with him, on a Saturday, and we reached
Sandabdr on the Monday evening. The inhabitants
were prepared for the batde and had set up mangonels,
which they discharged against the vessels when they
advanced in the morning. Those on the ships jumped
into the water, shields and swords in hand, and I
jumped with them, and God granted the vidlory to
the Muslims. We entered the city at the point of
the sword and the greater part of the infidels fled into
their sultan’s palace, but when we threw fire into it
they came out and we seized them. The sultan
thereafter set them free and returned their wives and
children to them. They numbered about ten thousand,
and he assigned to them one of the suburbs
of the city and himself occupied the palace, giving
the neighbouring houses to his courtiers.

When I had llayed with him at Sandabiir for three
months after the conque^ of the town, I asked him
for permission to travel and he made me promise to
return to him. So I sailed to Hinawr and thence by
Manjarfir and the other towns as before to Calicut.

I went on from there to ash-Shaliyat, a mo^t beautiful
town, in which the fabrics called by its name are
manufadhired.^ After a long ^ay in this town I
returned to Calicfit. Two slaves of mine who had
been on the kakam arrived at Caliciit and told me
that the ruler of Sumatra had taken my slave-girls,
rhat my goods had been seized by various hands, and
that my companions were scattered to China, Sumatra
and Bengal. On hearing this I returned to Hinawr
and Sandabur, reaching it after an absence of five
months, and ^ayed there two months,

240



CHAPTER VUI

The infidel sultan of Sandab^r, from whom we had
captured the town, now advanced to recapture it. All
the infidels fled to join him, and our troops who were
quartered in the [outlying] villages, abandoned us.
We were besieged by the infidels and reduced to great
traits. When the situation became serious, I left
the town during the siege and returned to Cdlicut,
where I decided to travel to Dhibat al-Mahal [Maidive
islands], about which I had heard a number of tales.
Ten days after embarking at Cilicdt we reached these
islands, which are one of the wonders of the world
and number about two thousand in all.^ Each
hundred or less of them form a circular clu^er resem-
bling a ring, this ring having one entrance like a
gateway, and only through this entrance can ships
reach the islands. When a vessel arrives at any one
of them it mu^l needs take one of the inhabitants to
pilot it to the other Islands. They are so close-set
that on leaving one island the tops of the palms on
another are visible. If a ship loses its course it is
unable to enter and is carried by the wind to the
Coromandel coa^l or Ceylon.

^ The inhabitants of the Maldives are all Muslims,
pious and uprig t. The islands are divided into
twelve di^lrifls, each under a governor whom they call
the KarJui. The diilri<5l of Mahal, which has given
its name to the whole archipelago, is the residence of
their sultans. There is no agriculture at all on any
of the islands, except that a cereal resembling millet
is grown in one diftrifl and carried thence to Mahal.

241 R



SELECTIONS FROM THE

The inhabitants live on a fish called qulb-al-mds, which
has red flesh and no grease and smells like mutton.
On catching it they cut it in four, cook it lightly,
then smoke it in palm leaf baskets.^ When it is
quite dry, they eat it. Some of these fish are exported
to India, China, and Yemen. Mo^t of the trees on
those islands are coco-palms, which with the fish
mentioned above provide food for the inhabitants.
The coco-palm is an extraordinary tree ; it bears twelve
bunches a year, one in each month. Some are small,
some large, some dry and some green, never changing.
They make milk, oil, and honey from it, as we have
already related [p. 1 15].

The people of the Maidive Islands are upright and
pious, sound in belief and sincere in thought; their
bodies are weak, they are unused to fighting, and their
armour is prayer. Once when I ordered a thief’s
hand to be cut off, a number of those in the room
fainted. The Indian pirates do not raid or mole^
them, as they have learned from experience that any-
one who seizes anything from them speedily meets
misfortune. In each island of theirs there are beauti-
ful mosques, and mo^ of their buildings are made of
wood. They are very cleanly and avoid filth; mo^
of them bathe twice a day to cleanse themselves,
because of the extreme heat there and their profuse
perspiration. They make plentiful use of perfumed
oils, such as oil of sandal-wood. Their garments are
simply aprons; one they tie round their waists in place
of trousers, and on their backs they place other cloths
resembling the pilgrim garments. Some wear a
turban, others a small kerchief in^ead. When any
of them meets the qadi or preacher, he removes his
cloth from his shoulders, uncovering his back, and
accompanies him thus to his house. All, high or
low, are bare-footed; their lanes are kept swept and
clean and are shaded by trees, so that to walk in them

242



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

is like walking in an orchard. In spite of that every
person entering a house wash his feet with water
from ajar kept in a chamber in the vestibule, and wipe
them with a rough towel of palm matting which he
finds there. The same praftice is followed on entering
a mosque.

From these islands there are exported the fish we
have mentioned, coconuts, cloths, and cotton turbans,
as well as brass utensils, of which they have a great
many, cowrie shells, and qanbar. This is the hairy
integument of the coconut, which they tan in pits on
the shore, and afterwards beat out with bars; the
women then spin it and it is made into cords for
sewing [the planks of] ships together. These cords
are exported to India, China, and Yemen, and are
better than hemp. The Indian and Yemenite ships
are sewn together with them, for the Indian Ocean
is full of reefs, and if a ship is nailed with iron nails
it breaks up on ^riking the rocks, whereas if it is
sewn together with cords, it is given a certain resilience
and does not fall to pieces. The inhabitants of these
islands use cowrie shells as money. This is an animal
which they gather in the sea and place in pits, where
its flesh disappears, leaving its white shell. They are
used for buying and selling at the rate of four hundred
thousand shells for a gold dinar, but they often fall
in value to twelve hundred thousand for a dinar.
They sell them in exchange for rice to the people of
Bengal, who also use them as money, as well as to the
Yemenites, who use them in^ead of sand [as ballast]
in their ships. These shells are used also by the
negroes in their lands; I saw them being sold at
Malli and Gawgaw [see Ch. XIV.] at the rate of
1,150 for a gold dinar.

an apron from their waiils to the ground, the re^ of
their bodies being uncovered. When I held the
qadi'ship there, I tried to put an end to this pra<fl:ice
and ordered them to wear clothes, but I met with no
success. No woman was admitted to my presence in
a lawsuit unless her body was covered, but apart from
that I was unable to effeft anything. I had some
slave-girls who wore garments like those worn at
Delhi and who covered their heads, but it was more
of a disfigurement than an ornament in their case,
since they were not accustomed to it. A singular
custom amongSt them is to hire themselves out as
servants in houses at a fixed wage of five dinars or less,
their employer being responsible for their upkeep;
they do not look upon this as dishonourable, and
moSt of their girls do so. You will find ten or twenty
of them in a rich man’s house. Every utensil that a
girl breaks is charged up againSt her. When she
wishes to transfer from one house to another, her new
employers give her the sum which she owes to her
former employers; she pays this to the latter and
remains so much in debt to her new employers. The
chief occupation of these hired women is spinning
qanhar. It is easy to get married in these islands on
account of the smallness of the dowries and the pleasure
of their women’s society. When ships arrive, the
crew marry wives, and when they are about to sail
they divorce them.’ It is really a sort of temporary
marriage. The women never leave their country.

It is a Grange thing about these islands that their
ruler is a woman, Khadija. The sovereignty belonged
to her grandfather, then to her father, and after his
death to her brother Shihab ad-Dm, who was a minor.
When he was deposed and put to death some years
later, none of the royal house remained but Khadija
and her. two younger sixers, so they raised Khadija to
the throne. She was married to their preacher, Jamal

ad-Din, who became Wazir and the real holder
of authority, but orders arc issued in her name only.
They write the orders on palm leaves with a curved
iron inRrument resembling a knife; they write nothing
on paper but copies of the Koran and works on theology.
When a stranger comes to the islands and visits the
audience-hall custom demands that he take two pieces
of cloth with him. He makes obeisance towards the
Sultana and throws down one of these cloths, then to
her Wazir, who is her husband Jamdl ad-Din, and
throws down the other. Her army comprises about
a thousand men, recruited from abroad, though some
are natives. They come to the palace every day,
make obeisance, and retire, and they are paid in rice
monthly. At the end of each month they come to
the palace, make obeisance, and say to the Wazir
“ Transmit our homage and make it known that we
have come for our pay,” whereupon orders are given
for it to be issued to them. The qddi and the officials,
whom they call wazirs, also present their homage daily
at the palace and after the eunuchs have transmittea
it they withdraw. The qddi is held in greater respeft
among the people than all the other functionaries; his
orders are obeyed as implicitly as those of the ruler
or even more so. He sits on a carpet in the palace,
and enjoys the entire revenue of three islands, accord-
ing to ancient custom. There is no prison in these
islands; criminals are confined in wooden chambers
intended for merchandise. Each of them is secured
by a piece of wood, as is done amongdt us [in Morocco]
with Christian prisoners.

When I arrived at these islands 1 disembarked on
one of them called Kannalfis, a fine island containing
many mosques, and I put up at the house of one of
the pious persons there. On this island I met a man
called Muhammad, belonging to Dhafar, who told
me that if I entered the island of Mahal the Wazir
HS



SE LECTIO NS FROM THE

would detain me there, because they had no qadi.
Now my design was to sail from there to Ma'bar
[Coromandel], Ceylon, and Bengal, and thence on
to China. When I had spent a fortnight at Kannalus,
I set sail again with my companions, and having
visited on our way several other islands, at which we
were received with honour and hospitably entertained,
arrived on the tenth day at the island of Mahal, the
seat of the Sultana and her husband, and anchored in
its harbour. The cu^om of the country is that no
one may go ashore without permission. When per-
mission was given to us I wished to repair to one of
the mosques, but the attendants on shore prevented
me, saying that it was imperative that I should visit
the Wazir. I had previously enjoined the captain of
the ship to say, if he were asked about me, “ I do not
know him,” fearing that I should be detained by them,
and ignorant of the fadl that some busybody had
written to them telling them about me and that I
had been qadi at Delhi. On reaching the palace we
halted in some porticoes by the third gateway. The
qadi ‘Isa of Yemen came up and greeted me and I
greeted the Wazir. The captain brought ten pieces
of cloth and made obeisance towards the Sultana,
throwing down one piece, then to the Wazir, throwing
down another in the same way. When he had thrown
them all down he was asked about me and answered
“ I do not know him.” Afterwards they brought out
betel and rose-water to us, this being their mark of
honour, and lodged us in a house, where they sent
us food, consisting of a large platter of rice surrounded
by plates containing salted meat, chickens, ghee, and
fish. Two days later the Wazir sent me a robe, with
a hospitality-gift of food and a hundred thousand
cowries for my expenses.

When ten days had passed a ship arrived from Ceylon
bringing some darwishes, Arabs and Persians, who

246



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

recognized me and told the Wazir’s attendants who
I was. This made him more delighted to have
me, and at the beginning of Ramaddn he sent for me
to join in a banquet attended by the amfrs and minidlcrs.
Later on I asked his permission to give a banquet to
the darwishcs who had come from visiting the Foot
[of Adam, in Ceylon]. He gave permission, and sent
me five sheep, which arc rarities among them because
they are imported from Ma‘bar, Mulaybdr, and
Maqdashaw, together with rice, chickens, ghee, and
spices, I sent all this to the house of the wazfr
Sulaymdn, who had it excellently cooked for me, and
added to it besides sending carpets and brass utensils.
I asked the Wazfr’s permission for some of the
minidlers to attend my banquet, and he said to me
“And I shall come too.” So I thanked him and on
returning home to my house found him already there
with the minidlcrs and high officials. The Wazir sat
in an elevated wooden pavilion, and all the amirs and
minidlcrs who came greeted him and threw down an
unsewn cloth, so that there were collefted about a
hundred cloths, which were taken by the darwishes.
The food was then served, and when the gue^ls had
eaten, the Koran-readers chanted in beautiful voices.
The darwishes then began their ritual chants and
dances. I had made ready a fire and they went into
it, treading it with their feet, and some of them ate
it as one eats sweetmeats, until it was extinguished.
When the night came to an end, the Wazir with-
drew and I went with him. As we passed
orchard belonging to the treasury he said to me This
orchard is yours, and I shall build a house in it for you
to live in.” I thanked him and prayed for his happi-
ness. Afterwards he sent me two slave-girls, some
pieces of silk, and a casket of jewels.

The attitude of the Wazir afterwards became
hostile to me for the following reason. The wazir
247



SELECTIONS FROM THE

Sulayman had sent to me proposing that I should
marry his daughter, and I sent to the Wazir Jamal
ad-Din to ask his permission for my acceptance. The
messenger returned to me and said “ The proposal
does not find favour with him, for he wishes to marry
you to his own daughter when her period of widow-
hood comes to an end.” But I for my part refused
that, in fear of the ill luck attached to her, for she had
already had two husbands who had died before con-
summating the marriage. Meanwhile I was seriously
attacked by fever, for every person who comes to this
island inevitably contrails fever. I determined there-
fore to leave it, sold some of the jewels for cowries,
and hired a vessel to take me to Bengal. When I
went to take leave of the Wazir, the qadi came out
to me and said “ The Wazir says ‘ If you wish to go,
give us back what we have given you and go.’ ” I
replied “ I have bought cowries with some of the jewels,
so do what you like with those.” He came back to
me and said “ He says ‘ We gave you gold, not
cowries.’ ” I said “ I shall sell them and give you
back the gold.” So I went to the merchants, asking
them to buy back the cowries from me, but the Wazir
forbade them to do so, his purpose in all this being
to prevent my leaving him. Afterwards he sent one
of his courtiers to me to say “ The Wazir says ‘ Stay
with us, and you shall have what you will.’ ” So
reasoning with myself that I was in their power and
that if I did not ^ay of my own free will I should be
kept by main force, and that it was better to ^ay of
my own choice, I said to his messenger “ Very well,
I shall ^ay with him.” When the messenger returned
to him he was overjoyed, and summoned me. As I
entered he rose and embraced me saying “ We wish
you to ^ay near us and you wish to go away from
us^ 1” I made my excuses, which he accepted, and
said to him “ If you wish me to ^ay I have some

248



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

conditions to make.” He replied “ Granted. Name
them.” I said “ I cannot walk on foot.” (Now it is
their custom that no one rides there except the Wazir,
and when 1 had been given a horse and rode out on
it, the population, men and boys, used to follow me
in amazement. At length 1 complained to him, so
he had the dunqura beaten and a public proclamation
made that no one was to follow me. ^e dunqura
is a sort of brass basin which is beaten with an iron
rod and can be heard at a great diilance; after beating
it any proclamation which it is desired to make is
publicly announced.) The Wazir said If you wish
to ride in a palanquin, do soj if not we have a horse
and a marc — choose which of them you wish.” So
I chose the marc and it was brought to me on the
spot, along with a robe. Then I said “What shall
I do with the cowries I bought ?” He replied “ Send
one of vour companies to sell them for you in Bengal."
I said “ I shall, on condition that you too send someone
to help him in the transaction.” He agreed to that,
so I sent off my companion Abu Muhammad and they
sent a man named al-Hdlj *Alf.

Immediately after the Ramaddn fa^l I made an
agreement with the wazfr Sulaymdn to marry his
daughter, so I sent to the Wazfr Jamdl ad-Dfn re-
quedling that the ceremony might be held in his
presence at the palace. He gave his consent, and sent
the cu^omaiy betel and sandalwood. The gueits
arrived but the wazir Sulaymdn delayed. He was
sent for but drill did not come, and on being summoned
a second time excused himself on the ground of his
daughter’s illness. The Wazfr then said to me
privily “ His daughter has refused, and she is her
own midlress. The people have assembled, so what
do you say to marrying the Sultana’s mother-in-law
(It was her daughter to whom the Wazir’s son was
married.) I said “ Very well,” so the qddf and notaries
249



SELECTIONS FROM THE

were summoned, and the profession of faith recited.
The Wazir paid her- dowry, and she was conduced
to me a few days later. She was one of the beil of
women.

After this marriage the Wazir forced me to take
the office of qadi. The reason for this was that I
had reproached the qadi for his practice of taking a
tenth of all elates when he divided them amongst
the heirs, saying to him “ You should have nothing
but a fee agreed upon between you and the heirs.”
Besides he never did anything properly. When I
was appointed, I ^rove my utmost to e^ablish the
prescriptions of the Sacred Law. There are no law-
suits there like those in our land. The fir^l bad
cu^om I changed was the practice of divorced wives
of laying in the houses of their former husbands, for
they all do so till they marry another husband. I
soon put that to rights. About twenty-five- men who
had a£led thus were brought before me; I had them
beaten and paraded in the bazaars, and the women
put away from them. Afterwards I gave ^rift in-
jundlions that the prayers were to be observed, and
ordered men to go swiftly to the streets and bazaars
after the Friday service; anyone whom they found
not having prayed I had beaten and paraded. I
compelled the salaried prayer-leaders and muezzins
to be assiduous in their duties and sent letters to all
the islands to the same effefl. I tried also to make
the women wear clothes, but I could not manage
that.

Meanwhile I had married three other wives, one
the daughter of a wazir whom they held in high
e^eem and whose grandfather had been sultan, another
the former wife of Shihab ad-Din. After these
marriages the islanders came to fear me, because of
their weakness, and they exerted themselves to turn
the Wazir againft me by slanders, until our relations

250



TRAVELS OF I 1} N II ATT OTA

became drained. Kow it liappcncd that a slave
belonging to the sultan Shihdb ad-Din was brought
before me on a charge ofadultcrp, and I had him beaten
and put in prison. The Wazir sent some of his
principal attendants to me to ask me to set him at
liberty. 1 said to them “ Are you going to intercede
for a negro slave who has violated his masler's honour,
when you yourselves but ycRcrday deposed Shihdb
ad-Din and put him to death because he had entered
the house of one of his slaves r" Thereupon I sent
for the slave and had him beaten with bamboo rods,
which give heavier blows than whips, and paraded
through the island with a rope round his neck. When
the Wazir heard of this he fell into a violent rage,
assembled the miniilers and army commanders and
sent for me. 1 came to him, and though 1 usually
made obeisance to him, t did not make obeisance but
simply said SMm 'j/jjkum. Then I said to those
present “ Be my witnesses that 1 resign the ofBce of
qldi because of my inability to carry out its duties,”
The Wazir addressed me, whereupon I mounted [to
the dais], sat down in a place facing him, and answered
him in the moil uncompromising manner. At this
point the muezzin chanted the call to the sunset
prayer and he went into his palace saying “ They say
that I am sulun, but I sent for this fellow to vent
my wrath on him and he vented his wrath on me.”
The respeft in which I was held amongii them was
due solely to the sultan of India, for they were aware
of the regard in which he held me, and even though
they are far diflant from him yet the fear of him is
in their hearts.

When the Wazir entered bis palace he sent for the
former qddl who had been removed from office. This
man had an arrogant tongue, and said to me “ Our
mailer asks you why you violated his dignity in the
presence of witnesses, and did not make obeisance to
zyi



SELECTIONS FROM THE

him.” I answered “ I used to make obeisance to, him
only because I was on good terms with him, but when
his attitude changed I gave that up. The greeting
of Muslims is Saldm and nothing more, and I said
Salami He sent him to me a second time to say
“ You are aiming only at leaving us ; give back your
wives’ dowries and pay your debts and go, if you
will.” On hearing this I made obeisance to him,
went to my house, and acquitted all the debts I had
contracted. On learning that I had done so and was
bent upon going, the Wazir repented of what he had
said and withheld his permission for my departure.
So I swore with the moCl solemn oaths that I had no
alternative but to leave, and removed all my possessions
to a mosque on the coaCt. I made a compaCl with
two of the ministers that I should go to the land of
Ma‘bar [Coromandel], the king of which was the
husband of my wife’s siCter, and fetch troops from
there to bring the islands under his authority, and
that I should be his representative in them. I arranged
that the signal between us should be the hoiking of
white flags on the ships; when they saw these they
were to rise in revolt on the shore. I had never
sugge^ed this to myself until the Wazi'r became
e^ranged from me. He was afraid of me and used
to say “ This man will without doubt seize the wazirate,
either in my lifetime or after my death.” He was
con^antly making enquiries about me and saying “ I
have heard that the king of India has sent him money
to aid him to revolt againCl me.” He feared my
departure, le^t I should fetch troops from Ma'bar,
and sent to me asking me to ^ay until he could fit
out a vessel for me, but I refused. The ministers
and chief men came to me at the mosque and begged
me to return. I said to them “ If I had not sworn
I should return.” They sugge^ed that I should go
to one of the islands to avoid breaking my oath and

252

then return, so I said “ Very well,” in order to satisfy
them. When the night fixed for my departure came
I went to take leave of the Wazir, and he embraced
me and wept so copiously that his tears dropped on
my feet. He passed the following night guarding
the island in person, for fear that my relatives^ by
marriage and my friends would rise in revolt againSt

I set sail and reached the island of the wazfr^ Alf.
Here my wife was attacked by severe pains and wished
to go back, so I divorced her and left her there, sending
word to that effe^ to the Wazfr, because she was the
mother of his son’s wife. We continued to travel
through the islands from one diAridl to another and
came to a tiny island in which there was but one
house, occupied by a weaver. He had a wife and
family, a few coco-palms and a small boat, with which
he used to fish and to cross over to any of the islands
he wished to visit. His island contained also a lew
banana trees, but we saw no land birds on it except
two ravens, which came out to us on our arrival and
circled above our vessel. And I swear I envied tha
man, and wished that the island had been mine, that
I might have made it my retreat until the inevitable
hour should befall me. We then came to the islan
of Muliik where the ship belonging to the
Ibrdhfm was lying. This was the ship in whic
had decided to travel to Ma’bar. Ibrdhim and his
companions met me and showed me great hospitality.
The Wazir had sent inilruaions that I was to receive
in this island thirty dinars’ worth of cowries, together
with a quantity of coconut, honey, betel, areca-nuts,
and fish every day. I ^ayed seventy days at Mu u
and married two wives there. The islanders were
afraid that Ibrahim would plunder them at the moment
of sailing, so they proposed to seize all the weapons
on his ship and keep them until the day of his depar-

SELECTIONS FR OM THE

ture. A dispute arose over this, and we returned to
Mahal but did not enter the harbour. I wrote to
the Wazir to tell him what had occurred, whereupon
he wrote to say that there was no cause for seizing
the weapons. We returned to Muluk and set sail
from there in the middle of Rabi‘ II., 745 (22nd
August 1344). Four months later the Wazi'r Jamal
ad-Din died — may God have mercy upon him.

We set sail without an experienced pilot on board,
the di^ance between the island and Ma'bar being
a three days’ journey, and travelled for nine days,
emerging on the ninth day at the island of Saylan
[Ceylon]. We saw the mountain of Sarandib there,
rising into the heavens like a column of smoke.^
When we came to the island, the sailors said “ This
port is not in the territory of the sultan whose country
can safely be visited by merchants. It is in the ter-
ritory or Sultan Ayri Shakarwatf, who is an evil
tyrant and keeps pirate vessels.”^ We were afraid
to put into this harbour, but as a gale arose thereafter
and we dreaded the sinking of the ship, I said to the
captain “ Put me ashore and I shall get you a safe-
conduft from this sultan.” He did as I asked and put
me ashore, whereupon the infidels came to us and
said “ What are you I told them that I was the
brother-in-law and friend of the sultan of Ma‘bar,
that I had come to visit him, and that the contents
of the ship were a present for him. They went to
their sultan and informed him of this. Thereupon he
summoned me, and I visited him in the town of
Battala [Puttelam], which is his capital. It is a small
and pretty town, surrounded by a wooden wall with
wooden towers. The whole of- its coa^s are covered
with cinnamon trees brought down by torrents and
heaped up like hills on the shore. They are taken
without payment by the people of Ma'bar and Mulay-
bar, but in return for this they give presents of woven

and a night’s journey from this island to the land or

flayed with him three days, enjoying great consider:^
tion which increased every day. He underflood
Persian and was delighted with the talcs I told him
of kings and countries. One day, after presenting
me with some valuable pearls, he said ‘ Do not be
shy, but ask me for anything that you want 1
replied “Since reaching this island I
one desire, to visit the blessed Foot of Adam. ^^Iney
call Adam Bdbi, and Eve they call Mdmd.) That
is simple,” he answered, “We shall send an escort
with you to take you to it.” “ That is what I wan^
said 1, then I added “And this ship that I came in
can set out in safety for Ma’bar, and^ ^ ^
you will send me in your own vessels." Certainly
he replied. When I related this to the captain,
however, he said to me “ I shall not sail until you
return, even if I wait a year on your account, so
told the sultan of this, and he said “ He will remain

. as my guefl until you come back.”

The sultan then gave me a palanquin, which was
carried by his slaves, and sent with me four logis,
whose cuflom it is to make an annual pilgrimage o
the Foot, three Brahmans,' ten other persons from his
entourage, and fifteen men to carry provisions. a er

situated at the extremity of the sultan’s territories.
The inhabitants entertained us with a fine banquet,
the chief dish at which was buffalo calves, which they
hunt in a fore^ there and bring in alive. After
passing the small town of Bandar Salawdt [Chilaw]
our way lay through rugged country intersected with
dreams. In this part there are many elephants, but
they do no harm to pilgrims and drangers, through
the blessed favour of the Shaykh Abu ‘Abdallah, who
was the fird to open up this road for the pilgrimage
to the Foot. These infidels used formerly to prevent
Muslims from making this pilgrimage and would
maltreat them, and neither eat nor trade with them,
but since the adventure that happened to the Shaykh,
as we have related above [p. 95], they honour the
Muslims, allow them to enter their houses, eat with
them, and have no suspicions regarding their dealings
with their wives and children. To this day they
continue to pay the greated veneration to this Shaykh,
and call him “ the Great Shaykh.”

After this we came to the town of Kunakar, which is
the capital of the principal sultan in this land.® It
lies in a narrow valley between two hills, near a great
lake called the Lake of Rubies, because rubies are
found in it. Outside the town is the mosque of Shaykh
‘Othman of Shiraz, known as the Shawush; the sultan
and inhabitants visit his tomb and venerate him. He
was the guide to the Foot, and when his hand and
foot were cut off, his sons and slaves took his place
as guides. The reason for his mutilation was that he
killed a cow. The Hindu infidels have a law that
anyone who kills a cow is slaughtered in the same
fashion or else put in its skin and burned. As Shaykh
‘Othman was so highly revered by them, they cut
off his hand and foot, indead, and assigned to him
the revenues of one of the bazaars. The sultan of
Kunakar is called the Kunar, and possesses a white



TRAVELS .OF IBN BATTOTA

elephant, the only white elephant I have seen in the
whole world. He rides on it at fe^ivals and puts
great rubies on its forehead. The marvellous rubies
called hahramdn [carbuncles] are found only in this
town. Some are taken from the lake and these are
regarded by them as the moft valuable, and some are
obtained by digging. In the island of Ceylon rubies
are found in all parts. The land is private property,
and a man buys a parcel of it and digs for rubies.
Some of them are red, some yellow [topazes], and
some blue [sapphires]. Their cuSlom is that all
rubies of the value of a hundred fanams belong to
the sultan, who pays their price and takes them;
those of less value belong to the finders. A hundred
fanams equal in value six gold dinars.

We went on from Kunafeir and halted at a cave called
after XJSii Mahmiid the Ldrf, a pious man who dug
out this cave at the foot of a hill beside a small lake.
Thence we travelled to the Lake of Monkeys. There
are in these mountains numbers or monkeys.
They are black and have long tails, and their males
are bearded like men. Shaykh ‘Othmdn and his sons
and others as well told me that these monkeys have
a chief, whom they obey as if he were a king. He
fallens on his head a fiUet of leaves and leans upon
a On his right and his left are four monkeys

carrying flaves in their hands. When the chief
monkey sits down the four monkeys ^land behind
him, and his female and young come and sit in front
of him every day. The other monkeys come and sit
at a diflance from him, then one of the four monkeys
addresses them and all the monkeys withdraw. After
this each one brings a banana or a lemon or some
such fruit, and the monkey chief with his young and
the four monkeys eat. One of the Yogis told me that
he had seen the four monkeys in the presence of their
chief beating a monkey with Clicks and after the beating

pulling out its hair. We continued our journey to
a place called “ The Old Woman’s Hut,” which is
the end of the inhabited part, and marched thence
by a number of grottoes. In this place we saw the
flying leech, which sits on trees and in the vegetation
near water. When a man approaches it jumps out
at him, and wheresoever it alights on his body the
blood flows freely. The inhabitants keep a lemon in
readiness for it; they squeeze this over it and it falls
off them, then they scrape the place on which it
alighted with a wooden knife which they have for the
purpose.

The mountain of Sarandi'b [Adam’s Peak] is one
of the higheff in the world. We saw it from the sea
when we were nine days’ journey away, and when
we climbed it we saw the clouds below us, shutting
out our view of its base. On it there are many ever-
green trees and flowers of various colours, including
a red rose as big as the palm of a hand. There are
two tracks on the mountain leading to the Foot, one
called Bdba track and the other Mama track, meaning
Adam and Eve. The Mamd track is easy and is
the route by which the pilgrims return, but anyone
who goes by that way is not considered by them to
have made the pilgrimage at all. The Baba track is
difficult and ^iff climbing. Former generations cut
a sort of stairway on the mountain, and fixed iron
^anchions on it, to which they attached chains for
climbers to hold on by."^ There are ten such chains,
two at the foot of the hill by the “ threshold,” seven
successive chains farther on, and the tenth is the
“ Chain of the Profession of Faith,” so called because
when one reaches it and looks down to the foot of the
hill, he is seized , by apprehensions and recites the
profession of faith for fear of falling. When you
climb padt this chain you find a rough track. From
the tenth chain to the grotto of Khidr is seven miles ;

this grotto lies in a wide plateau, and near by it is
a spnng full of fish, but no one catches them. Close
to this there are two tanks cut in the rock on cither
side of the path. At the grotto of Khidr the pilgrims
leave their belongings and ascend thence for two miles
to the summit of the mountain where the Foot is.

The blessed Footprint, the Foot of our father
Adam, is on a lofty black rock m a wide plateau.
The blessed Foot sank into the rock far enough to
leave its impression hollowed out. It is eleven spans
long. In ancient days the Chinese came here and
cut out of the rock the mark of the great toe and the
adjoining parts. They put this in a temple at Zayttin,
where it is visited by men from the farthefl parts of
the land. In the rock where the Foot is there are
nine holes cut out, in which the infidel pilgrims place
offerings of cold, precious Clones, and jewels. You
can see the Qarwishes, after they reach the grotto of
Khidr, racing one another to take what there is in
these holes. We, for our part, found nothing in
them but a few flones and a little gold, which we gave
to the guide. It is cuflomary for the pilgrims to flay
at the grotto of Khidr for three days, visiting the Foot
every morning and evening, and we followed this
prafiice. When the three days were over we returned
by the Mdmd track, halting at a number of villages
on the mountain. At the mot of the mountain there
is an ancient tree whose leaves never fall, situated in
a place that cannot be got at. I have never met
anyone who has seen its leaves. I saw there a number
of Yogis who never quit the base of the mountain
waiting for its leaves to fall. They tell lying tales
about it, one being that whosoever eats of it regains
his youth, even if he be an old man, but that is false.
Beneath the mountain is the great lake from which
the rubies are taken ; its water is a bright blue to the
sight.

TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

We travelled thence to Dinawar, a large town on
the coaft, inhabited by merchants. In this town
there is an idol, known as Dinawar, in a va^ temple,®
in which there are about a thousand Brahmans and
Yogis, and about five hundred women, daughters of
the infidels, who sing and dance every night in front
of the idol. The city and all its revenues form an
endowment belonging to the idol, from which all who
live in the temple and who visit it are supplied with
food. The idol itself is of gold, about a man’s height,
and in the place of its eyes it has two great rubies,
which, as I was told, shine at night like lamps. We
went on to the town of Qali [Point de Gralle], a small
place eighteen miles from Dinawar, and journeyed
thence to the town of Kalanbii [Colombo], which is
one of the fine^ and larged towns in Ceylon. In it
resides the wazir and ruler of the sea Jala^ti, who
has with him about five hundred Abyssinians. Three
days after leaving Kalanbd we reached Battdla again
and visited the sultan of whom we have spoken above.
I found the captain Ibrahim awaiting me and we set
sail for the land of Ma‘bar.

CtWITliR IX


O". our VO) jgc :o Mi’bir [Cofo landcl] a gale sprang
up and our ship near!) fdicd with ualcr. We had
no capcr.crccd pilot on board. We narrowl) escaped
being urcched on some rocha, and then came into some
shallows where the ship ran aground. We were
face to-face with death, and thoie on board jettisoned
all that the) had, and bade farewell to one another.
We cut down l.he nvasl and threw it overboard, and
the iailo.T made a wooden raft. We were then about
SIX n Ics from ll e shore, t set about climbing down
to the rail, when m) co-ipanions (for 1 had two slave
girls ard two of m) compan.ons with me) said to me
“Are ) 0 u going to go on the raft and leave us?"
So I put their safet) before mj own and said “You
two go ar d Uwe with }ou the girl that 1 like." The
other girl said “ 1 am a good swimmer and I shall
hold on to one of the raft ropes and swim with them."
So both m) companions and the one girl went on the
rafr, the oilier girl swimming. The sailors tied ropes
to the raft and swam with their aid I sent along
with them all the things that I valued and the jewels
and ambergris, and they rcaehed the shore in safety
because the wind was in their favour. 1 myself flayed
on the ship. The captain made his way ashore on
the rudder. The sailors set to work to make four
rafts, but night fell before they were completed, and
the ship lillcd with water. 1 climbed on the poop
and flayed there until morning, when a party of in-
fidels came out to us m a boat and we went ashore
with them In the land of Ma'bar. We told them



SELECTIONS FROM THE

that we were friends of their sultan, under whose
protection they live, and they wrote informing him
of this. He was then two days’ journey away,, on' an
expedition. I too wrote to him telling him what had
happened to me.

We Clayed there three days, at the end of which
an amir arrived from the sultan with a body of horse
and foot, bringing a palanquin and ten horses. I
and my companions, the captain, and one of the slave-
girls rode, and the other was carried in the palanquin.
We reached the fort of Harkatd,^ where we spent
the night, and where I left the slave-girls and some,
of my slaves and companions. On the following day
we arrived at the camp of the sultan, who was Ghiyath
ad-Din of Damaghan.^ He was married to the
daughter of the late Sultan Jalal ad-Din, and it was
her siCter that I had married in Delhi. It is a cuClom
throughout the land of India that no person enters
the sultan’s presence without boots on. I had no boots
with me so one of the infidels gave me a pair. There
were a number of Muslims there and I was aClonished
to find an infidel show greater courtesy than they did.
When I appeared before the sultan he bade me be.
seated and assigned to me three tents in his vicinity,
sending me carpets and food. .Later on I had an
interview with him and put before him the projeCt
to send an army to the Maidive Islands. He resolved
to do so, decided what vessels were to be sent, and
designated a gift for the Sultana, together with robes
and presents for the ministers and amirs. He charged
me to draw up his contraCl of marriage with the
Sultana’s siCter and ordered three vessels to be loaded
with alms for the poor of the islands. Then he said
to me You will return in five days’ time,” but the
admiral said to him “ It is impossible to sail to the
islands for three months yet.” “ Well then ” he
replied to me, “ if that is the case, come to Fattan

262



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

until we finish the present campaign and return to
our capital Mutra [Madura], and the expedition will
5lart from there.”

The country through which we were to pass was
an uninterrupted and impassable jungle of trees and
reeds. The sultan gave orders that every man in
the army, great and small alike, should carry a hatchet
to cut it down, and when the camp was struck, he rode
forward with his troops and they cut down those
trees from morning to noon. Fooa was then brought,
and the whole army ate in relays, afterwards returning
to their tree-felling until the evening. All the infidels
whom they found in the jungle were taken prisoner,
and brought to the camp with their wives and children.
Their pradlice is to fortify their camp with a wooden
palisade, which has four gates. Outside the palisade
there are platforms about three feet high on which
they light a fire at night. By the fire there is pofred
a night guard of slaves and footsoldiers, each of whom
carries a bundle of thin canes. If a party of infidels
should attempt to attack the camp by night each sentry
lights the bundle he has in his hand, so that the night
becomes as bright as the day, and the horsemen ride
out in pursuit of the infidels. In the morning the
infidels whom our troops had captured the previous
day were divided into four groups and impaled at
the four gates of the camp. Their women and little
children were butchered mso and the women tied by
their hair to the pales. Thereafter the camp was
frruck and they set to work cutting down another
patch of jungle, and all those who were taken prisoner
were treated in the same way. This [slaughtering
of women and children] is a dafrardly praftice,
which I have never known of any [other] king,
and it was because of it that God brought him to a
speedy end.

I left the camp and reached Fattan, which is a large
263



SELECTIONS FROM THE

and fine city on the coa^, with a wonderful harbour.®
There is a great wooden pavilion in it, eredled on
enormous beams and reached by a covered wooden
gallery. When an enemy attacks the place they tie
all the vessels in port to this pavilion, which is manned
by soldiers and archers, so that the enemy has no
chance [of capturing them]. In this city there is
a fine mosque, built of ^lone, and it has also large
quantities of grapes and excellent pomegranates. I
met here the pious shaykh Muhammad of Nishapfir,
one of the crazy darwishes who let their hair hang
loose over their shoulders. He had with him a lion
which he had tamed, and which used to eat and sit
along with the darwishes. Accompanying him were
about thirty darwishes, one of whom had a gazelle.
Though the gazelle and the lion used to be together
in the same place, the lion did not molest it. While
I was laying at Fattan the sultan fell ill and came
to the city. I went out to meet him and made him
a present. When he had taken up his residence
there he sent for the admiral and said to him “ Take
no business in hand except [to equip] the ships which
are to make the expedition to the islands.” He wished
also to give me the value of my present, but I refused
it. Afterwards I was sorry for this, because he died
and I received nothing. He ftayed a fortnight at
Fattan and then .set out for his capital, but I ^ayed
there for another fortnight.

I then journeyed to his capital, the city of Mutra
[Madura], a large town with wide Greets. On my
arrival I found it in the grip of a plague. Those
who were attacked by it died on the second or third
day, or at the mo^l on the fourth. When I went out
I saw none but sick and dead. The sultan on reaching
Mutra had found his mother, wife, and son ill, and
after laying in the town for three days, he went out
to a river three miles away. I joined him there, and

264



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

he ordered me to be lodged alongside the qddi.
Exactly a fortnight later the sultan died and was
succeeded by his nephew Ndsir ad-Dfn. The new
sultan gave orders that I should be furnished with
all the ships that his uncle had appointed for the
expedition to the islands. Later on, however, I fell
ill of a fever which is mortal in those parts, and thought
that my time had come. God inspired me to have
recourse to the tamarind, which grows abundantly
there, so I took about a pound of it, put it in water
and drank it. It relaxed me for three days, and God
healed me of my illness. I took a dislike to this town
in consequence, and asked the sultan for permission
to depart. He said to me “ Why should you go ?
It is only a month until the season for the expedition
to the islands. Stay until we give you all that the
Ma^lc^ of the World [the late sultan] ordered for
you." I refused however, and he wrote on my behalf
to Fattan, that I might sail In any ship I wished.

I returned to Fattan, and found eight vessels sailing
to Yemen, on one of which I embarked. We fell in
with four warships which engaged us for a short time,
but afterwards they retired and we went on to Kawlam
[Quilon]. As I was ilill feeling the cffefls of my
illness, 1 flayed there for three months, afterwards
embarking on a vessel with the intention of making
for Sultan Jamil ad-Dln of Hinawr. When we
reached the small island between Hinawr and Fikan^r,"*
we were assailed by the infidels with twelve warships,
who fought us vigorously and got the better of us.
They seized all that I had kept in reserve for emer-
gencies, together with the jewels and precious Clones
which the king of Ceylon gave me, my clothes and the
travelling provisions I kept with me which had been
given me by pious men and saints, leaving me with
no covering but my trousers. They seized the pos-
sessions of every one on board, and put us ashore on



SELECTIONS FROM THE'.

the coa^l. I made my way back to Caliciit, and
went into a mosque; one of the theologians sent
me a robe, the qadi sent a turban, and a merchant
another robe.

At Caliciit I learned of the marriage of the Sultana
Khadija [of the Maidive islands] with the wazir
‘Abdallah after the death of the wazir Jamal ad-Din,
and that my wife, whom I had left there pregnant, had
given birth to a son. I thought therefore of making
a journey to the islands, but remembering the hostility
of the wazir ‘Abdallah towards me I [sought an omen
from the Koran and] opened the volume at these
words The angels shall descend upon them saying “ Fear
not, neither he sadF So I commended myself to God,
and set sail. Ten days later I disembarked at Kan-
naliis, where the governor received me with honour,
made me his gue^t, and fitted out a boat for me.
Some of the islanders went to the wazir ‘Abdallah
and informed him of my arrival. He asked about
me and who had come with me, and was told that
the purpose of my visit was to fetch my son, who
was about two years old.® His mother came to the
wazir to lay a complaint again^ this, but he replied
to her “ I for my part will not hinder him from taking
away his son.” He pressed me to visit the island [of
Mahal], and lodged me in a house facing the tower
of his palace, that he might observe my movements.
My son was brought to me, but I thought it better
that he should ^tay with them so I gave him back to
them. After a ^ay of five days, it appeared to me
that the be^ plan was to ha^en my departure, and I
asked permission to leave. The wazir summoned
nie, and when I entered his presence he seated me at
his side and asked how I fared. I ate a meal in his
company and washed my hands in the same basin
with him,, a thing which he does with no one. Betel
was brought in and I took my leave. He sent me

266



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

robes and hundreds of thousands of cowries, and was
mo^l generous in his treatment of me.

I set out again, and we spent forty-three nights at
sea, arriving eventually at the land of Bangdia [Bengal].
This is a v^ country, abounding in rice, and nowhere
in the world have I seen any land where prices are
lower than there; on the other hand it is a gloomy
place, and the people of Khurdsin call it “ A hell full
of good things?’ I have seen fat fowls sold there at
the rate of eight for a single dirham, young pigeons
at fifteen to the dirham, and a fat ram sold for two
dirhams. I saw too a piece of fine cotton cloth, of
excellent Quality, thirty cubits long, sold for two
dinars, and a beautiful slave-girl for a single gold
dinar, that is, t^vo and a half gold dinars in Moroccan
money. The firA city in Bengal that we entered was
Sudkdwdn, a large town on the coaA of the great
sea.® Close by it the river Ganges, to which the
Hindus go on pilgrimage, and the river Jiin’ unite
and discharge together into the sea. They have a
large fleet on the river, with which they make war on
the inhabitants of the land of Laknawti.®

The sultan of Bengal is Sultan Fakhr ad-Dfn, an
excellent ruler with a partiality for Arangers, especially
danvfshes and sdffs. The kingship of this land
belonged to Sultan Ndsir ad-Dln, whose grandson
was taken prisoner by the sultan of Delhi, and released
by Sultan Muhammad when he became king, on
condition of sharing his sovereignty with him. He
broke his promise and Sultan Muhammad went to
war with him, put him to death, and appointed a
relative by marriage of his own as governor of that
country. This man was put to death by the troops
and the kingdom was seized by ‘AH-Shdh, who was
then in Laknawti. When Fakhr ad-D/n saw that
the kingship had passed out of the hands of Ndsir
ad-Dfn’s descendants (he was a client of theirs), he
267



SELECTIONS FROM THE

revolted in Sudkawan and Bengal and made himself
an independent ruler. A violent struggle took place
between him and ‘AH-Shah. During the season of
winter and mud, Fakhr ad-Din used to make expedi-
tions up the river again^ the land of Laknawti, because
of his naval superiority, but when the rainless season
returned, ‘AH-Shah would make raids by land on
Bengal, because of his superiority in land-forces.
When I entered Sudkawan I did not visit the sultan,
nor did I meet him, as he is a rebel again^ the king
of India, and I was afraid of the consequences which
a visit to him might entail.

I set out from Sudkawan for the mountains of
Kamard, a month’s journey from there. This is a
va^t range of mountains extending to China and also
to the land of Thubbat [Tibet], where the musk deer
are. The inhabitants of this range resemble the
Turks; they possess great endurance, and their value
as slaves is many times greater than a slave of any
other nationality.® They are famous for their magical
practices. My purpose in travelling to these moun-
tains was to meet a notable saint who lives there,
namely, Shaykh Jalal ad-Din of Tabriz. At a distance
of two days’ journey from his abode I was met by
four of his disciples, who told me that the Shaykh
had said to the darwishes who were with him “ The
traveller from the We^ has come to you; go out
to welcome him.” He had no knowledge whatever
about me, but this had been revealed to him. I went
with them to the Shaykh and arrived at his hermitage,
situated outside the cave. There is no cultivated
land there, but the inhabitants of the country, both
Muslim and infidel, come to visit him, bringing gifts
and presents, and the darwishes and travellers live
on these offerings. The Shaykh however limits him-
self to a single cow, with whose milk he breaks his fa^t
every ten days. It was by his labours that the people



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

of thue mounuini bcumc converted to IsUm, and
that wai the reason for his settling amongfl them.
When I came into his presence he rose to greet me
and embraced me. He asked me about my native
land and my travels, and when 1 had given him an
account of them he said to me “ You arc the traveller
of the Arabs-" Those of his disciples who were there
said “ And the non-Arabs too, O our mafler-" “ And
of the non-Arabs too " he repeated, “ so show him
honour." They then took me to the hermitage and
gave me hospiulity for three days.

On the day when 1 visited the Shaykh I saw that he
was wearing a wide mantle of goatshair. It took my
fancy and I said to mpclf “ I wish the Shaykh could
have given it to me." When I visited him to bid
him farewell, he went to the side of the cave, took oflt
the mantle and placed it upon me, together with a
skull-cap from his head, himself putting on a patched
garment. The darwlshcs told me that the Shavkh
was not in the habit of wearing this mantle and nad
put it on only when I arrived, saying to them “ This
mantle will be asked for by the Moroccan, and it
will be taken from him by an infidel sultan, who svill
give it to our brother Burhin ad-DIn of Sigharj,
whose it is and for whom it was made" When they
told me this I said to them " I have obtained the
blessing of the Shaykh through his clothing me with
his garments, and I for my part shall not enter the
presence of any sulun, infidel or Muslim, svearing
this mantle" With this 1 withdrew from the Shaykh’s
presence. Now it came about a long time afterwards
that I visited China and eventually reaehed the city
of Khansd [Hang-chosv-fu]. My party were separated
from me by the pressure of the crowd and I was wearing
this mantle. I happened to be in a certain direct
when the wazlr came by with a large suite. His eye
fell upon me, and summoning me he clasped my hand,
269



SELECTIONS FROM THE

asked me about my arrival, and continued talking to
me until I came to the sultan’s palace with him. At
this point I wished to take leave of him, but he would
not hear of it and introduced me into the sultan’s
presence. The latter queftioned me about the
Muhammadan sultans and when I replied to his
que^ions, he looked at the mantle and took a liking
to it. The wazir said to me “ Take it oftV’ and I
could not resist his order. So the sultan took it and
ordered me to be given ten robes, a horse and harness,
and a sum of money. The incident roused my anger,
but afterwards I recalled the Shaykh’s saying that an
infidel sultan would seize it and I was deeply amazed
at the fulfilment of the predidlion. The following
year I entered the palace of the king of China at
Khan-Batiq [Peking], and sought out the convent of
the Shaykh Burhan ad-Dm of Sagharj. I found him
reading and wearing that identical mantle. I was
a^onished and took it in my hand to examine it.
He said to me “ Why examine it when you know it
already “ True ” I replied, “ it is the one that
was taken from me by the sultan of Khansa.” “ This
mantle ” he went on “ was made specially for, me by
my brother Jalal ad-Din, who wrote to me saying
‘ The mantle will reach you by the hand of so-and-so.’ ”
Then he brought out the letter and I read it, marvel-
ling at the Shaykh’s perfeft foreknowledge. I told
Burhan ad-Din the beginning of the ^ory, and he said
to me “ My brother Jalal ad-Din can do much more
than all this, he has the powers of creation at his
disposal, but he has now passed to the mercy of God.
I have been told ” he added, “ that he prayed the dawn-
pmyer every day at Mecca, and that he made the
pilgrimage every year, for he used to disappear from
sight on the days of ‘Arafa and the festival, and no
one knew where he went.”

When I had bidden farewell to Shaykh Jalal ad-Din

270



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

I journeyed to Habanq, an exceedingly large and
beautiful city, traversed by the river which descends
from the Kdmarii mountains. This river is called
the Blue River,*® and is used by travellers to Bengal
and Laknawtl. On its banks there are water wheels,
orchards, and villages to right and to left, like the
Nile in Egypt. Its people are infidels under Muslim
rule, who are mulcted of half their crops and pay
taxes over and above that. We travelled down the
river for fifteen days between villages and orchards,
juil as if we were going through a bazaar. There
are innumerable vessels on it and each vessel carries
a drum; when two vessels meet, each of them beats
its drum and they salute one another. Sultan Fakhr
ad-Dln gave orders that no passage-money should be
taken on this river from darwishes, and that provisions
were to be supplied to those of them who had none,
and when a darwish comes to a town he is given half
a dinar. After fifteen days* sailing down the river,
as we have related, we reached the city of Sunur-
kdwdn,'* where we found a junk on the point of sailing
for the land of Jdwa [Sumatra], which is a journey
of forty days from there, so we embarked on it.


271



CHAPTER X


Fifteen days after leaving Sunarkawan we reached
the country of the Barahnakar, whose mouths are like
those of dogs.^ This tribe is a rabble, professing
neither the religion of the Hindus nor any other.
They live in reed huts roofed with grasses on the
seashore, and have abundant banana, areca, and betel
trees. Their men are shaped like ourselves, except
that their mouths are shaped like those of dogs; this
is not the case with their womenfolk, however, who
are endowed with surpassing beauty. Their men too
go unclothed, not even hiding their nakedness, except
occasionally for an ornamental pouch of reeds sus-
pended from their wai^s. The women wear aprons
of leaves of trees. With them reside a number of


Muslims from Bengal and Sumatra, who occupy a
separate quarter. The natives do all their trafficking
with the merchants on the shore, and bring them
water on elephants, because the water is at some
di^ance from the coa^ and they will not let the
merchants go to draw it for themselves, fearing for
their women because they make advances to well-
formed men. Elephants are numerous in their land,
but no one may dispose of them except the sultan,
from whom they are bought in exchange for woven
^uffs.


Their sultan came to meet us, riding on an elephant,
which carried a sort of packsaddle made of skins.
He himself was dressed* in goatskins with the hair
to the outside; on his head there were three coloured
bands of silk, and he had a reed javelin in his hand.
Accompanying were about twenty of his relatives,

272



T U A V i: L S OF I U N II A T T O T A

mounted on clqdunts. We sent him a present of
pepper, fiingcr, cinnamon, [cured] Ush from the
Slaik!l\c hlarfJs, and seme Hcn^*a!i cloth. They do
not ucaf the cloth ihcmscKcs, but cover their ele-
phants with it on fcaCt dap. This sultan exacts from
cscry ship that puts in at his land a slave mrl, a white
slave, enough cloth to cover an elephant, anu ornaments
of gold, which his wife wcata on her girdle and her
toes. If anyone withholds this tribute, they put a
spell on him which raises a ilorm on sea, so that he
perishes or all but perishes.

Twcnty*bvc davs after leaving these people sve
reached the island of Jiwa [^Sumatra], “ from svhich
the incense called /iu/ takes jts name. We saw the
island when we were tlill half a day's journey from it.
It U verdant and fertile; the commontil trees there
are the coco-palm, arcca, clove, Indian 3loe> jack-
tree,* mango, jamim,* sweet orange, and camphor
cane, ‘fhe commerce of its inhablunti is carried on
with pieces of tin and native Chinese gold, unsmcltcd.
The majority of the aromatic plants which grow there
arc found only in (he di^lri^s occupied by the intidels;
in the Muslim dii\ri£U they arc levs plentiful. When
we reached the harbour its people came out to us in
small boats with coconuts, bananas, mangoes, and
fish. Their cu^lom is to present these to the mcr-
chir\ts, who recompense them, each according to his
means. The admirars representative also came on
board, and after interviewing the merchants who were
with us gave us permission to land. So we went
ashore to the port, a large village on the coaft with
a number of houses, called Sarh;l.‘^ It is four miles
diflanl from the town. The admiral's representative
having written to the sultan to inform nim of my
arrival, the Utter ordered the amir DawUsa to meet
me, along with the aidi and other dolors of the law.
They came out for that purpose, bringing one of the
273 T



SELECTIONS FROM THE

sultan’s horses and some other horses as well. I and
my companions mounted, and we rode in to the sultan’s
capital, the town of Sumutra, a large and beautiful
city encompassed by a wooden wall with wooden
towers.

The sultan of Jawa, al-Malik az-Zahir, is a mo^
illu^rious and open-handed ruler, and a lover of
theologians. He is con^antly engaged in warring
for the Faith [again^ the infidels] and in raiding
expeditions, but is withal a humble-hearted man, who
walks on foot to the Friday prayers. His subjects
also take a pleasure in warring for the Faith and
voluntarily accompany him on his expeditions. • They
have the upper hand over all the infidels in their
vicinity, who pay them a poll-tax to secure peace.

As we went towards the palace we found near by
it some spears ^uck in the ground on both sides of
the road. These are to indicate to the people to dis-
mount ; no one who is riding may go beyond them, so
we dismounted there. On entering the audience-hall
we found the sultan’s lieutenant, who rose and greeted
us with a handshake. We sat down with him and
he wrote a note to the sultan informing him of our
arrival, sealed it and gave it to a page, who brought
the reply written on the back. After this a page
rought 2. buqshaj that is, a linen bag. The lieutenant
ta ing this led me by the hand into a small house,
were he spends his hours of leisure during the day.
•tie then brought out of the huqsha three aprons, one

1 - ’ cotton and the third of

silk and linen, three garments like aprons which they
call underclothing, three garments of different kinds
^ jniddleclothing, three woollen mantles, one of
hem being white, and three turbans. I put on one
or the aprons m place of trousers, according to their
custom, and one garment of each kind, and my com-
panions took the reil of them. After food had been

274


TRAVELS OF IRN BATTOTA

served we left the palace and rode in company with
the lieutenant to a garden surrounded by a wooden
wall. In the midA of the garden there was a house
built of wood and carpeted with Arips of cotton velvet,
some dyed and others undyed. We sat down here
along with the lieutenant. The amfr Dawlasa then
came bringing two slave girls and two men servants,
and said to me **The sultan says to you that this
present is in proportion to his means, not to those of
Sultan Muhammad [of India]/' The lieutenant left
after this, and the amir Dawlasa remained with me.

The amir and I were acquainted with one another,
as he had come as an envoy to the sultan at Delhi.
I said to him ** When can I sec the sultan ?" and he
replied “ It is the cuAom of our country that a new-
comer t^'aits three nights before saluting the sultan»
that he may recover from the fatigue of his journey.”
We Aayed for three days, food being sent to us thnee
a day and fruits and rare sweetmeats every evening
and morning. On the fourth day, which was a Friday,
the amfr Dawlasa came to me and said “ You will
salute the sultan [today] in the royal enclosure of the
cathedral mosque after the service.” After the prayer
I went in to the sultan; he shook me by the hand
and 1 saluted him, whereupon he bade me sic down
upon his left and asked me about Sultan Muhammad
and about my travels. He remained in the mosque
until the afternoon prayers had been recited, alter
which he went into a chamber there, put off the
garments he was wearing (these were robes of the kind
worn by theologians, which he puts on when he comes
to the mosque on Fridays), and dressed in his royal
robes, which arc mantles of silk and cotton. On
leaving the mosque he found elephants and horses at
the gate. Their cuAom is that if the sultan rides on
an elephant his suite ride on horses, and vice vgrsa.
On this occasion he mounted an elephant, so we rode
275



SELECTIONS FROM THE

on horses, and went with him to the audience hall.
We dismounted at the usual place [where the lances
were] and the sultan rode on into the palace, where
a ceremonial audience was held, the sultan remaining
on his elephant opposite the pavilion where he sits
[at receptions]. Male musicians came in and sang
before him, after which they led in horses with silk
caparisons, golden anklets, and halters of embroidered
silk. These horses danced before him, a thing which
astonished me, though I had seen the same performance
at the court of the king of India.

My Slay at his court in Sumutra la^ed fifteen days,
after which I asked his permission to continue my
journey, since it was now the sailing season, and because
it is not possible to travel to China at all times of the
year. He fitted out a junk for us, provisioned us,
and made us rich presents — may God reward him ! —
sending^ one of his courtiers with us to bring his
hospitality gift to us on the junk. We sailed along
the coa^l of his territories for twenty-one nights, and
arrived at Mul-Jawa, an infidel land, two months’
ourney in length, and containing aromatic spices and
the excellent aloes called Qdguli and Qamdri, Qaqula
and Qamara [after which these aloes are named] form
part of the territories of this land.® In the territories
of the sultan of Sumutra there is only incense, camphor,
and a little cloves and Indian aloes, whereas the larged
quantity of these is found in Mul-Jawa.

On reaching the port of Qaqula, we found there a
number of junks ready for making piratical raids, and
also for dealing with any junks that might attempt to
resist their exactions, for they impose a tribute on each
[calling at that place]. We went ashore to
Qaqula, which is a fine town with a wall of hewn
^ne^ broad enough for three elephants to walk
abrea^ on it. The fir^ thing I saw outside the town
was elephants bearing loads of Indian aloes, which

276



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

they burn in their houses and which fetches the same
price as firewood with us, or even less. That is when
they arc selling amongil themselves; to the merchants,
on the other hand, they sell a load of it for a roll of
cotton cloth, which is dearer in their land than silk.
Elephants are very numerous there; they ride on
them and use them to carry loads. Every person has
his elephants picketed at his door, and every shop>
keeper his elephant picketed near him, for riding on
to his house and for carrying loads. The same is
the case with all the people of China and Cathay
[Northern China].

The sultan of Mul-Jdwa is an inhdcl; I saw him
outside his palace sitting beside a pavilion on the bare
ground. With him were the omcers of iffatc, and
the troops were passing in review before him — foot-
soldiers, for there are no horses there except those
belonging to the sultan, and they have no beafls but
elephants on which to ride and 6ght. He was told
about me and summoned me, whereupon I came
forward and said “Peace \ai-ialdm\ be upon those
who follow the true religion,”' They undcrAood
nothing but the word as^Ja/Jm, The sultan then
welcomed me and ordered a piece of cloth to be spread
for me to sit upon. I said to the interpreter “ How
can I sit on the cloth when the sultan is sitting on the
ground?” He replied “Such is his habit; he sits
on the ground out of humility. You arc a gue^l and
have come from a great sultan, so he wishes to show
you honour.” Thereupon I sat down, and having
asked me very briefly about the sultan [of India] he
said to me “ You shall ilay with us as a gue^l for three
days, and after that you may go.”

While this sultan was sitting in audience, I saw a
man with a knife in his hand resembling a book-
binder's tool. * He put this knife to his own neck,
and delivered a long speech which I did not under-
277



SELECTIONS FROM THE

^and, then gripped it with both hands and cut his
own throat. So sharp was the knife and so strong
his grip that his head fell to the ground. I was
amazed at his action. The sultan said to me “ Does
anyone do this in your country 1 replied “ I have
never seen such a thing.” Then he laughed and said
“ These are our slaves, who kill themselves for love
of us.” He gave orders that the body should be
carried away and burned, and the sultan’s lieutenants,
the officers of ^ate, the troops, and the citizens went out
to his cremation. The sultan assigned a large pension
to his children, wife, and brothers, and they were held
in high e^eem because of this aft. One of those
present at this audience told me that the speech made
by the man was a declaration of his affeftion for the
sultan, and that he was slaying himself for love of
him, as his father had slain himself for love of the
sultan’s father, and his grandfather for love of the
sultan’s grandfather. Thereafter I withdrew from
the audience and he sent me a gueft’s portion for three
days.

We continued our journey by sea and thirty-four
days later came to the sluggish or motionless sea.®
There is a reddish tinge in its waters, which, they say,
is due to soil from a country in the vicinity. There
are no winds or waves or movement at all in it, in
spite of its wide extent. It is on account of this sea
that each Chinese junk is accompanied by three vessels,
as we have mentioned, which take it in tow and row
it forwards. Besides this every junk has about twenty
oars as big as mafts, each of which is manned by a
mufter of thirty men or so, who ftand in two ranks
facing one another. Attached to the oars are two
enormous ropes as thick as cables; one of the ranks
pulls on the cable [at its side], then lets go, and the
other rank pulls [on the cable at its side]. They chant
in musical voices as they do this, moft commonly

278



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

saying /j’/i, Wc passed thirty-seven days on

this sea, and the sailors were surprised at the facility
of our crossing, for they [usually] spend forty to fifty
days on it, and forty days is the shortcut time required
under the mo^ favourable circum^ances.

Thereafter wc reached the land of Tawdlisl, it being
their king who is called by that name. It is a vait
country and its king is a rival of the king of China.
He possesses many junks, with which he makes war on
the Chinese until thty come to terms with him on
certain conditions. The inhabitants of this land are
idolaters; they arc handsome men and closely resemble
the Turks in figure. Their skin is moil commonly
of a reddish hue, and they arc brave and warlike.
Their women ride on horseback and arc skilful archers,
and fight exadlly like men. We put in at one of their
ports, at the town of Kayldkari, which is among their
fineA and larceA cities. It was formerly the residence
of the son of their king. When we anchored in the
port their troops came down and the captain went
ashore to them, taking with him a present for the
prince. When he enquired of them about him,
however, they told him that the prince’s father had
appointed him governor of another diAriA and had
made his daughter, whose name was Urduja, governor
of this city.®

The day following our arrival at the port of Kaylij-
karf, this princess summoned the ship's captain and
clerk, the merchants and pilots, the commander of
the footsoldicrs, and the commanders of the archers
to a banquet which she had prepared for them, accord-
ing to her cuAom, The captain wished me to go
with them, but I declined, because, being infidels, it
is not lawful to eat their food. When they came into
her presence she asked them if there was any one else
of their company who had not come. The captain
replied “There is only one man left, a bakhshi (that
279



SELECTIONS FROM THE

is, a qadi, in their tongue), and he will not eat your
food.” Thereupon she said “ Call him,” so her guards
came [to me] along with the captain’s party and said
“ Comply with the princess’s wish.” I went to her
then, and found her sitting in full ^ate. On my
saluting her she replied to me in Turkish, and asked
me from what land I had come. I said to her “ From
the land of India.” “ From the pepper country .f”’
she asked, and I replied “ Yes.” She questioned me
about this land and events there, and when I had
answered she said “ I muSl positively make an expedi-
tion to it and take possession of it for myself, for the
quantity of its riches and its troops attrafts me.” I
replied “ Do so.” She ordered me to be given robes,
two elephant loads of rice, two buffaloes, ten sheep,
four pounds of syrup, and four martahdns (that is,
large jars) filled with ginger, pepper, lemons, and
mangoes, all of them salted, these being among the
things prepared for sea vogayes.

The captain told that this princess has in her army
women, female servants and slave-girls, who fight like
men. She goes out in person with her troops, male
and female, makes raids on her enemies, takes part
in the fighting, and engages in single combat with
picked warriors. He told me too that during a fierce
engagement with certain of her enemies, many of her
troops were killed and they were all but defeated,
when she dashed forward and broke through the ranks
until she reached the king again^ whom she was
fighting, and dealt him a mortal blow with her lance.
He fell dead and his army took to flight. She brought
back his head on the point of a spear, and his relatives
redeemed it from her for a large sum of money. When
she returned to her father he gave her this town,
which had formerly been in her brother’s hands.
The captain told me also that she is sought in marriage
by various princes, but she says “ I shall marry none

280



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

but him who fights and overcomes me in single com-
bat,” and they avoid fighting with her for fear of the
disgrace [that would attach to them] if she overcame
them.

We then left the land of Tawilisi and after seventeen
days at sea with a favouring wind, sailing with maximum
speed and case, reached the land of China.



CHAPTER XI


The land of China is of va^l extent, and abounding
in produce, fruits, grain, gold and silver. In this
respedl there is no country in the world that can rival
it. It is traversed by the river called the “ Water
of Life,” .which rises in some mountains, called the
“ Mountain of Apes,” near the city of Khan-Baliq
[Peking] and flows through the centre of China for
the space of six months’ journey, until finally it reaches
Sin as-Sin [Canton].^ It is bordered by villages,
fields, fruit gardens, and bazaars, ju^ like the Egyptian
Nile, only that [the country through which runs] this
river is even more richly cultivated . and populous,
and there are many waterwheels on it. In the land
of China there is abundant sugar-cane, equal, nay
superior, in quality to that of Egypt, as well as grapes
and plums. I used to think that the ‘Othmani plums
of Damascus had no equal, until I saw the plums in
China. It has wonderful melons too, like those of
Khwarizm and Isfahan. All the fruits which we have
in our country are to be found there, either much the
same or of better quality. Wheat is very abundant
in China, indeed better wheat I have never seen, and
the same may be said of their lentils and chick-peas.

The Chinese pottery [porcelain] is manufadlured
only in the towns of Zaytun and Si'n-kalan. It is
made of the soil of some mountains in that di^ri<5l,
which takes fire like charcoal, as we shall relate sub-
sequently. They mix this with some ^ones which
they have, burn the whole for three days, then pour
water over it. This gives a kind of clay which they

282



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTDTA

cause to ferment. The bcA quality of [porcelain is
made from] clay that has fermented for a complete
month, but no more, the poorer quality [from clay]
that has fermented for ten days. The price of this
porcelain there is the same as, or even less than, that
of ordinary pottery in our country. It is exported to
India and other countries, even reaching as far as
our own lands in the We^, and it is the hne^ of all
makes of pottery.

The hens and cocks in China arc very big indeed,
bigger than geese in our country, and hens* eggs there
arc bigger than our goose eggs. On the other hand
their geese are not at all large.* We bought a hen
once and set about cooking it, but it was too big for
one pot, so we put it tn two. Cocks over there are
about the size of oAriches; often a cock will shed its
feathers and [nothing but] a great red body remains.
The lirA time I saw a Chinese cock was in the city
of Kawlam. I took it for an oArich and was amazed
at it, but its owner told me that in China there were
some even bigger than that, and when I got to China
I saw for myself the truth of what he had told me
about them.

The Chinese themselves arc infidels, who worship
idols and burn their dead like the Hindus.* The
king of China is a Tatar, one of the descendants of
Tinkiz [Chingiz] Khdn. In every Chinese city there
is a quarter for Muslims in which they live by them-
selves, and in which they have mosques both for the
Friday services and for other religious purposes. The
Muslims arc honoured and respefted. The Chinese
infidels eat the fiesh of swine and dogs, and sell it
in their markets. They arc wealthy folk and well-to-
do, but they make no display either in their food or
their clothes. You will sec one of their principal
merchants, a man so rich that his wealth cannot be
counted, wearing a coarse cotton tunic. But there is
283



SELECTIONS FROM THE

one thing that the Chinese take a pride in, that is,
gold and silver plate. Every one of them carries a
Slick, on which they lean in walking, and which they
call “ the third leg.” Silk is very plentiful among
them, because the silk-worm attaches itself to fruits
and feeds on them without requiring much care. For
that reason it is so common to be worn by even the
very poorest there. Were it not for the merchants it
would have no value at all, for a single piece of cotton
cloth is sold in their country for the price of many
pieces of silk. It is cu^omary among^ them for a
merchant to ca^ what gold and silver he has into
ingots, each weighing a hundredweight or more or
less, and to put those ingots above the door of his
house.

The Chinese use neither [gold] dinars nor [silver]
dirhams in their commerce. All the gold and silver
that comes into their country is ca^ by them into
ingots, as we have described. Their buying and
selling is carried on exclusively by means of pieces of
paper, each of the size of the palm of the hand, and
stamped with the sultan’s seal. Twenty-five of these
pieces of paper are called a hdlisht, which takes the
place of the dinar with us [as the unit of currency].'*
When these notes become torn by handling, one
takes them to an office corresponding to our mint,
and receives their equivalent in new notes on delivering
up the old ones. This transaftion is made without
charge and involves no expense,® for those who have
the duty of making the notes receive regular salaries
from the sultan. Indeed the direflion of that office
is given to one of their principal amirs. If anyone
goes to the bazaar with a silver dirham or a dinar,
intending to buy something, no one will accept it
from him or pay any attention to him until he changes
if for bdlisht^ and with that he may buy what he will..

All the inhabitants of China and of Cathay® use in

TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

place of charcoal a kind of lumpy earth found in their
country. It resembles our fuller’s earth, and its
colour too is the colour of fuller’s earth. Elephants
[are used to] carry loads of it. They break it up into
pieces about the size of pieces of charcoal with us,
and set it on fire and it burns like charcoal, only giving
out more heat than a charcoal fire. When it is reduced
to cinders, they knead it with water, dry it, and use
it again for cooking, and so on over and over again
until it is entirely consumed. It is from this clay
that they make the Chinese porcelain ware, after
adding to it some other ^ones, as we have related.’

The Chinese are of all peoples the mo^l skilful in
the arts and possessed of the greatest mailery of them.
This charafteri^lic of theirs is well known, and has
frequently been described at length in the works of
various writers. In regard to portraiture there is
none, whether Greek or any other, who can match
them in precision, for in this art they show a marvel-
lous talent. I myself saw an extraordinary example
of this gift of theirs, I never returned to any of their
cities alter I had visited it a time without finding
my portrait and the portraits of my companions drawn
on the walls and on sheets of paper exhibited in the
bazaars. When I visited the sultan’s city I passed
with my companions through the painters’ bazaar on
my way to the sultan’s palace. We were dressed
after the ‘Irdql fashion. On returning from the
palace in the evening, I passed through the same
bazaar, and saw my portrait and those of my com-
panions drawn on a sheet of paper which they had
affixed to the wall. Each of us set to examining the
other’s portrait [and found that] the likeness was
perfect in every respefl. I was told that the sultan
had ordered them to do this, and that they had come
to the palace while we were there and had been ob-
serving us and drawing our portraits without our
285



SELECTIONS FROM THE

noticing it^ This is a cuftom of theirs, I mean making
portraits of all who pass through their country. In
faft they have brought this to such perfection that if
a Granger commits any offence that obliges him to
flee from China, they send his portrait far and wide.
A search is then made for him and wheresoever the
[person bearing a] resemblance to that portrait is
found he is arreCled.

When a Muhammadan merchant enters any town
in China, he is given the choice between Claying with
some specified merchant among the Muslims domiciled
there, or going to a hoClelry. If he chooses to Clay
with the merchant, his money is taken into cuClody
and put under the charge of the resident merchant.
The latter then pays from it all his expenses with
honeCly and charity. When the visitor wishes to
depart, his money is examined, and if any of it is
found to be missing, the resident merchant who was
put in charge of it is obliged to make good the deficit.
If the visitor chooses to go to the hoClelry, his property
is deposited under the charge of the keeper of the
hoClelry. The keeper buys for him whatever he
desires and presents him with an account. If he
desires to take a concubine, the keeper purchases a
slave-girl for him and lodges him in an apartment
opening out of the hoClelry, and purveys for them
both. Slave-girls fetch a low price; yet all the Chinese
sell their sons and daughters, and consider it no
disgrace. They are not compelled, however, to travel
with those who buy them, nor on the other hand,
are they hindered from going if they choose to do so.
In the same way, if a Clranger desires to marry, marry
he may; but as for spending his money in debauchery,
no, that he may not do. They say “ We will not
have it noised about amongCl Muslims that their people
waCle their subClance in our country, because it is aland
of riotous living and [women of] surpassing beauty.”

286



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

China is the safest and be^l regulated of countries
for a traveller. A man may go by himself a nine
months* journey, carrying with him large sums of
money, without any fear on that account. The system
by which they ensure his safety is as follows. At
every po^l-5lation in their country they have a ho^lelry
controlled by an officer, who is stationed there with
a company of horsemen and footsoldiers. After
sunset or later in the evening the officer visits the
hostelry with his clerk, rcgillers the names of all
travellers laying there for the night, seals up the liit,
and locks them into the hostelry. After sunrise he
returns with his clerk, calls each person by name, and
writes a detailed description of them on the li^l. He
then sends a man with them to conduft them to the
next poft-^lation and bring back a clearance certificate
from the controller there to the effe(5t that all these
persons have arrived at that station. If the guide
does not produce this document, he is held responsible
for them. This is the pra£lice at every Elation in
their country from Sfn as-Sln to Khdn-Bdliq. In
these hoflelries there is everything that the traveller
requires in the way of provisions, especially fowls and
geese. Sheep on the other hand, are scarce with
them.

To return to the account of our journey. The
fir^l city which we reached after our sea voyage was
the city of Zaytun. [Now although zaytun means
“ olives ”] there are no olives in this city, nor indeed
in all the lands of the Chinese nor in India; it is simply
a name which has been given to the place.® Zaytdn
is an immense city. In it are woven the damask silk
and satin fabrics which go by its name,® and which
are superior to the fabrics of Khansa and Khdn-Baliq.
The port of Zaytiin is one of the largest in the world,
or perhaps the very largest. I saw in it about a
hundred large junks; as for small junks, they could
287



SELECTIONS FROM THE

not be counted for multitude. It is formed by a
large inlet of the sea which penetrates the land to the
point where it unites with the great river. In this
city, as in all Chinese towns, a man will have a fruit-
garden and a field with his house set in the middle
of it, ju^ as in the town of Sijilmasa in our own
country.^® For this reason their towns are extensive.
The Muslims live in a town apart from the others.

On the day that I reached Zaytiin I saw there the
amir who had come to India as an envoy with the
present [to the sultan], and who afterwards travelled
with our party and was shipwrecked on the junk.
He greeted me, and introduced me to the controller
of the douane and saw that I was given good apart-
ments [there] I received visits from the qadi of
the Muslims, the shaykh al-Islam, and the principal
merchants. Among^ the latter was Sharaf ad-Dln of
Tabriz, one of the merchants from whom I had
borrowed at the time of my arrival in India, and the
one who had treated me mo^ fairly. He knew the
Koran by heart and used to recite it con^antly. These
merchants, living as they do in a land of infidels, are
overjoyed when a Muslim comes to them. They say
“ He has come from the land of Islam,” and they
make him the recipient of the tithes on their properties,
so that he becomes as rich as themselves.^ There
was living at Zaytdn, among^ other eminent shaykhs,
Burhan ad-Dln of Kazarfin, who has a hermitage out-
side the town, and it is to him that the merchants pay
the sums they vow to Shaykh Abii Ishaq of Kdzarfin
[see p. 97].

When the controller of the douane learned my ^ory
he wrote to the Qan,^^ who is their Emperor, to inform
him of my arrival on a mission from the king of India.
I asked him to send with me someone to conduft me
to the di^rift of Sin [Sin as-Sln], which they call
Sin-kalan,^^ so that I might see that di^ridf, which is

288




CANTON IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY




TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

in his province, in the interval before the arrival of
the Qdn*s reply. He granted my reque^, and sent
one of his officers to conduA me. 1 sailed up the
river on a vessel resembling the war galleys in our
coun^, except that in this the rowers plied their oars
^landing upright, their place being in the centre of
the vessel,^ while the passengers were at the forepart
and the ^ern. They spread over the ship awnings
made from a plant which grows in their country,
resembling but different from flax, and finer than
hemp [perhaps grass-cloth]. We sailed up this river
for twenty-seven days.*® Every day we used to tie
up about noon by a village where we could buy what
we needed and pray the noon prayers, then in the
evenings we went ashore at another village and so
on, until we reached the city of Sfn-kalin or Sfn as-Sfn.
Porcelain is manufa^hired there as well as at Zaytdn,
and hereabouts the river of the “Water of Life”
flows into the sea, so they call the place “ The Meeting
of the Waters.” Sln-kalan is a city of the fir^l rank,
in regard to size and the quality of its bazaars. One
of the largest of these is the porcelain bazaar, from
which porcelain is exported to all parts of China, to
India, and to Yemen. In the centre of this city there
is an enormous temple with nine portalsj” inside each
of which there is a portico with benches where the
inmates of the temple sit. Between the second and
third portals there is a place containing chambers,
which are occupied by the blind and crippled. Each
of the occupants receives subsistence and clothing from
die endowment of the temple. There are similar
establishments between all the portals. In the interior
there is a hospital for the sick and a kitchen for cooking
food, and it has a Staff of doSlors and servitors. I was
told that aged persons who are incapacitated from
gaining their livelihood receive subsistence and clothing
at this temple, likewise orphans and destitute widows.

289 u



SELECTIONS FROM THE

This temple was built by one of their kings, who
moreover endowed it with [the revenues of] this city
and the villages and fruit gardens belonging to it.
The portrait of this king is painted in the temple we
have described, and they worship it.

In one of the quarters of this city is the Muham-
madan town, where the Muslims have their cathedral
mosque, hospice and bazaar. They have also a qadi
and a shaykh, for in every one of the cities of China
there mu^ always be a Shaykh al-Islam, to whom all
matters concerning the Muslims are referred [i.e. who
adfs as intermediary between the government and the
Muslim community], and a qadi to decide legal cases
between them. My quarters were in the house of
Awhad ad-Din of Sinjar, one of their principal men,
of excellent charafter and immensely wealthy. I
^ayed with him for fourteen days, during which gifts
were poured upon me one after the other from the
qadi and other Muslims. Every day they made a
new entertainment, to which they came in beautifully-
appointed boats, bringing musicians with them.
Beyond the city of Sin-kalan there is no other city,
either infidel or Muslim. It is sixty days’ journey,
so I was told, from there to the Rampart of Gog and
Magog, the intervening territory being occupied by
nomadic infidels, who eat men when they get hold
of thernr^® On that account no one ever crosses their
country or visits it, and I did not find in Sin-kalan
anyone who had himself seen the Rampart or even
seen anyone who had seen it.

A few days after my return to Zaytdn, the Qan’s
order arrived with in^rudtions to convey me to his
capital with all honour and dignity, by water if I
preferred, otherwise by land. I chose to sail up the
■river, so they made ready for me a fine vessel of the
sort that is designed for the use of governors. The
governor sent his ^aff with us, and he, and likewise

290



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

the qddi and the Muslim merchants, sent us large
quantities of provisions. We travelled as ^late-gue^ls,
eating our midday meal at one village, and our evening
meal at another. After ten days* journey we reached
Qanjanfii, a large and beautiful city set in a broad
plain and surrounded by fruit-gardens,^® which gave
the place the look of the Ghdta at Damascus.^ On
our arrival, we were met outside the town by the
qddf, the Shaykh al-Isldm, and the merchants, with
^andards, drums, trumpets, and bugles, and musicians.
They brought horses for us, so we rode in on horse-
back while they walked on foot before us. No one
rode along with us but the qddi and the Shaykh
al-Isldm. The governor of the city with his ^aff
also came out [to meet us], for the sultan’s gue^l is
held in very high honour by them, and so we entered
the city. It has four walls; between the firft and
second live the sultan’s slaves, who are some of them
day-guards and others night-guards of the city; between
the second and third are the quarters of the mounted
troops and the general who governs the city; within
the third wall live the Muslims (it was here that we
lodged at the house of their shaykh), and within the
fourth is the Chinese quarter, which is the largest of
these four cities [in one]. The distance separating
each gate in this city from the next is three or four
miles, and every inhabitant, as we have said, has his
own orchard, house, and grounds.

One day as I was staying at Qanjanfd, a very large
vessel came in, belonging to one of their moil re-
spedled dodlors. I was asked if he might see me,
and he was announced as “ Mawlan^ [Our mailer
i.e. The reverend] Qiwam ad-Din of Ceuta.” His
name roused my intereil, and when he came in and

at me as if you knew me.” So I said to him “ Where
do you come from ?” He replied “ From Ceuta.”
“ And I ” said I “ from Tangier.” Whereupon he
broke into fresh greetings to me, and wept until I
wept in sympathy with him. I then said to him
“ Did you go to India ?” He replied “ Yes, I went
to the capital, Delhi.” Then when he told me that,
I remembered him and said “ Are you al-Bushri ?”
and he replied “ Yes.” I remembered he had come
to Delhi with his mother’s brother, Abu-’l-Qasim of
Murcia, as a beardless youth and a very clever student.
I had spoken of him to the sultan of India, who gave
him three thousand dinars and invited him to ^ay
at his court, but he refused, as he was set on going
to China, where he prospered exceedingly, and ac-
quired enormous wealth. He told me that he had
about fifty white slaves and as many slave-girls, and
presented me with two of each, along with many
other gifts. I met his brother in after years in the
Negrolands — ^what a di^ance lies between them I
I ^ayed at Qanjanfd for fifteen days and then
continued my journey. The land of China, in spite
of all that is agreeable in it, did not attradl me. On
the contrary I was sorely grieved that heathendom
had so Strong a hold over it. Whenever I went out
of my house I used to see any number of revolting
things, and that distressed me so much that I used
to keep indoors and go out only in case of necessity.
When I met Muslims in China I always felt juSt as
though I were meeting my own faith and kin. So
great was the kindness of this dodtor al-Bushrf that
when I left Qanjanfd he accompanied me for four
days, until I reached the town of .Baywam Qutlfi.^^
This is a small town, inhabited by Chinese, a pro-
portion of them being troops, the reSt common people.
The Muslim community there consiSls of four houses

friend. We put up at the house of one of them, and
^ayed with him for three days, after which I bade the
dodor adieu and set out again.

I sailed up the river with the usual routine, flopping
for dinner at one village, and for supper at another.
After seventeen days of this, we reached the city of
Khansi [Hang-chow], which is the biggc^ city I
have ever seen on the face of the earth.” It is so
long that it takes three days to traverse in the ordinary
routine of marches and halts. It is built after the
Chinese fashion already described, each person, that
is, having his own house and garden. It is divided
into six cities, as we shall describe later. On our
arrival a party came out to meet us, consiAing of the
qidi and the Shaykh al-Islim of the city, and the
family of 'Othmdn ibn AfBn of Egypt, who arc the
principal Muslim residents there, accompanied by
a white flag, drums, bugles, and trumpets. The
governor of the city also came out [to meet us] with
his escort, and so we entered the town.

Khansd consiAs of six cities, each with its own wall,
and an outer wall surrounding the whole. In the hrA
city arc the quarters of the city guards and their com-
mander; 1 was told by the qddf and others that they
muAcred twelve thousand men on the rcgiAcr of
troops. We passed the firA night after our entry in
the house of their commander. On the second day
we entered the second city through a gate called the
Jews* Gate. In this city live the Jews, ChriAians,
and sun-worshipping Turks, a large number in all;
its governor is a Chinese and we passed the second
night in his house. On the third day we entered
the third city, and this is inhabited by the Muslims.
Theirs is a fine city, and their bazaars are arranged
juA as they are in Islamic countries; they have mosques
in it and muezzins — we heard them calling to the
noon prayers as we entered. We Aayed here in the

293



SELECTIONS FR OM THE

mansion of the family of ‘Othman ibn ‘Affan of Egypt.
He was a wealthy merchant, who conceived a liking
for this city and made his home in it, so that it came
be be called ‘Othmdniya after him, and he transmitted
to his posterity the influence and respe< 51 : which he
enjoyed there. It was he who built the cathedral
mosque of Khansa, and endowed it with large bene-
fadlions. The number of Muslims in this city is
very large, and our dlay with them ladled fifteen days.
Every day and night we were the gue^s at a new
entertainment, and they continuously provided the
mo^ sumptuous meats, and went out with us every
day on pleasure rides into different quarters of the
city.

One day they rode out with me and we entered the
fourth city, which is the seat of governnient, and in
which the chief governor Qurtay resides. When we
entered the gate leading to it, my companions were
separated from me, and I was found by the wazfr,
who conduced me to the palace of the chief governor
Qurtay. It was on this occasion that he took from
me the mantle which the saint Jalal ad-Din of Shiraz
had given me, as I have already related [p. 269].
No one resides in this city, which is the mo^l beautiful
of the six, except the sultan’s slaves and servants.
It is traversed by three breams, one of them being
a canal taken off from the great river, which is used
by small boats bringing provisions and coal to the
town, and there are pleasure boats on it as well. The
citadeP® lies in the centre of' this city. It is of enor-'
mous size, and the government house, ^ands in the
middle of it, surrounded by [the court of] the citadel
on all sides. Within it there are arcades, in which
sit workmen making rich garments and weapons.
The amir Qurtay told me that there were sixteen
hundred ma^er-workmen there, each with three or
four apprentices working under him. They are all

294



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

without exception the slaves of the Qin; they have
chains on their feet, and they live outside the fortress.
They arc permitted to go out to the bazaars in the
city, but may not go Beyond its gate. They arc
passed in review before the governor every day, a
hundred at a time, and if any one of them is missing,
his commander is held responsible for him. Their
cuflom is that when one of them has served for ten
years, he is freed from his chains and given the choice
between ilaying in service, without chains, or going
wherever he will within the Qin’s dominions, but
not outside them. When he reaches the age of fifty
he is exempted from work and maintained [by the
^te]. In the same way anyone else who has attained
this age or thereabouts is maintained."^ Anyone
who reaches the age of sixty is regarded by them as
a' child, and legal penalties cease to be applicable to
him. Old men in China arc greatly respected, and
each one of them is called Atd, which means
“ Father.”

The amir Qurtay is the principal amir in China.®
He entertained us in his palace, and prepared a banquet
(their name for it is fowa),^ which was attended by
the principal men of the city. He had Muslim cooks
brought, who slaughtered the animals [in accordance
with Muslim ritu:u, so that the food should be cere*
monially clean] and cooked the food. This amir, in
spite or his ei^tcd rank, presented the dishes to us
with his own hand, and with his own hand carved
the meat. We flayed with him as his gueAs for three
days. He sent his son with us to the canal, where
we went on board a ship resembling a fire-ship, and
the amlris son went on another along with musicians
and singers. They sang in Chinese, Arabic, and
Persian. The amir's son was a great admirer of
Persian melody, and when they sang a certain Persian
poem he commanded them to repeat it over and over

a pleasant lilt, and goes like this ;

On this canal there was assembled a large crowd in
ships with brightly-coloured sails and silk awnings,
and their ships too were admirably painted. They
began a mimic battle and bombarded each other with
oranges and lemons.^ We returned in the evening
to the amir’s palace, and spent the night there. The
musicians were there, and sang all kinds of pleasing
melodies.

That same night a certain juggler, one of the Qan’s
slaves, was there. The ami'r said to him “ Show us
some of your feats.” So he took a wooden ball with
holes in which there were long leather thongs, and
threw it into the air. It rose right out of our sight,
for we were sitting in the middle of the palace court,
during the season of intense heat. When nothing,
blit a short piece of the cord remained in his hand,
he ordered one of his apprentices to go up the rope,
which he did until he too disappeared from our sight.
The juggler called him three times without receiving
any reply, so he took a knife in his hand, as if he were
enraged, and climbed up the rope until he disappeared
as well. The next thing was that he threw the boy’s
hand to the ground, and then threw down his foot,
followed by his other hand, then his other foot, then
his trunk, and finally his head. After that he came
down himself puffing and blowing, with his clothes
all smeared with blood, and kissed the ground in front
of the amir, saying something to him in Chinese.
The amir gave him some order, and thereupon he took
the boy s limbs, placed them each touching the other.

2nd gave him a kick, and up he rose as sound as ever,
i was amazed and took palpitation of the heart, juA
as had happened to me when I saw something similar
at the court of the king of India, so they admmi^cred
some potion to me which removed my di^lress. The
qddi Afkhar ad-Dfn was sitting beside me, and he
said to me: ** By God, there was no climbing or coming
down or cutting up of limbs at all; the whole thing
is Juil hocus-pocus.”

On the following day we entered the fifth and
largcR city, which is inhabited by the common folk.
Its bazaars arc good and contain very skilful artificers;
it is there that the fabrics which take their name from
this town arc woven. We passed a night in this city
as the gucdls of its governor, and on the morrow entered
the sixth city through a gate called Boatmen’s gate.
This sixth city, which lies on the banks of the great
river, is inhabited by seamen, fishermen, caulkers, and
carpenters, along with archers and footsoldiers, all of
them being slaves of the sultan. No other persons
live Qn this town] with them, and their numbers are
very great. We spent a night there as the guc^^s of
its governor. The amir Qurtay equipped a vessel
for us with all that was needed in the way of provisions,
etc., and sent his suite with us to arrange for our
hospitable reception [on the journey]. So we left this
city, which is the laA of the provinces of China [proper],
and entered the land of Khitd [Cathay].

Cathay is the bcR cultivated country in the world.
There is not a spot in the whole extent of it that is
not brought under cultivation. The reason is that
if any part is left uncultivated its inhabitants or their
neighbours arc assessed for the land-tax due thereon.
Fruit-gardens, villages, and fields extend along both
banks of this river without interruption from the city
of Khansd to the city of Khdn-Bdiiq [Peking], which
is a space of sixty-four days' journey. There are no

SELECTIONS FROM THE

Muslims to be found in these di^rifts, except casual
travellers, since the country is not suitable for [their]
permanent residence, and there is no large city in it,
only villages and wide spaces,^® covered with corn,
fruit-trees, and sugarcane. I have never seen any-
thing in the world like it, except a space of four days’
journey between Anbdr and ‘Ana [in ‘Iraq; see
P* 303]* disembark every night and

^ay in the villages in order to receive our provisions
as gue^s of the sultan.

.Thus we completed our journey to the city of Khan-
Baliq, also called Khaniqii,^® the capital of the Qan —
he being their emperor, whose dominion extends over
the countries of China and Cathay. When we arrived
there we moored at a distance of ten miles from the
city, as is their custom, and a written report of our
arrival was sent to the admirals, who gave us per-
mission to enter the port of the city. Having done
so, we disembarked and entered the town, which is
one of the largest towns in the world. It is not laid
out, however, after the Chinese fashion, with gardens
inside the city, but is juft like the cities in other coun-
tries with gardens outside the walls. The sultan’s
city lies in the centre, like a citadel, as we shall relate.
I ftayed with Shaykh Burhan ad-Din of Sdgharj —
the same man to whom the king of India sent 40,000
dinars with an invitation to him [to come to India],
and who took the money and paid his debts with them,
but refused to go to the king and set out [inftead]
for China [see above p. 202]. The Qan set him at
the head of all the Muslims who live in his territories,
and gave him the title of Sadr al-Jihdn. The word
qdn is a term applied by them to every person who
exercises the sovereignty over [all] the provinces, juft
as every ruler of the country of Ldr is called atdbeg?^
His name is Pashay,^^ and there is no infidel on the
face of the earth who owns an empire greater than his.

His palace lies in the centre of the [inner] city, which is
appropriated to his residence. The greater part of it is
conftrufled of cars-ed wood, and it is excellently planned.

When we reached the capital Khin-Blliq, we found
that the Qin was absent irons it at that time, as he
had gone out to tijjht his cousin Finlz, who had
rebelled againsl him in the dislrifl of Qariqorum and
Biih-lliligts in Cathay.^ The dislance between these
places and the capital is a three months' journey
through cultis-atcd diilrifls. After his departure the
majority of his amirs threw oiT their allegiance to him
and agreed to de|>ose him because he had departed
from the precepts of the TjtJf, that is, the precepts
which were laid dosvn by their anceflor Tinklz
[Chingiz] Khin, svho laid wafle the lands of IsUm.
They went over to his rebel nephew and wrote to the
Qin to the elTefl that he should abdicate and retain
the city of Khansi as an appanage. He refused to
do so, foughc them, and w'os defeated and killed.

It was a few dap after our arrival at his capital
that the news of this was received. The city was
decorated; trumpets, bugles and drums were played,
and games and entertainments held for the space of
a month. Thereafter the slain Qln was brought,
with about a hundred other slain, his cousins, relatives,
and intimates. A great eJ'ar, that is, a subterranean
chamber, was dug for him and richly furnished. The
Qin was laid in it with his weapons, and all the gold
and silver plate from his palace was deposited in it
with him. With him also were put four slavegirls
and six of the principal mamluks, who carried drinking
vessels, then the door of the chamber was built up and
the whole thing covered over with earth until it reached
the size of a large mound. After that they brought
■four horses and drove then about the Qin's grave
until they flopped [from exhauflion], then they set
up a wooden ereftion over the grave and suspended

the horses on it, having fir^ driven a piece of wood
. through each horse from tail to mouth.^^ The above-
mentioned relatives of the Qan were also placed in
subterranean chambers along with their weapons and
house utensils, and they impaled over the tombs of the
principal members, of whom there were ten, three horses
each, and over the tombs of the re^l one horse each.

This day was observed as a solemn holiday, and
not one person was absent from the ceremony, men
or women, Muslim or heathen. They were all
dressed in mourning robes, which are white capes in
the case of the infidels and [long] white garments in
the case of the Muslims. The Qan’s khatiins and
courtiers lived in tents near his grave for forty days,
some even more than that, up to a year; and a bazaar
was e^ablished there to supply the food and other
things which they required. Such practices as these
are observed, so far as I can record, by no other people
in these days. The heathen Indians and Chinese, on
the other hand, burn their dead; other people do
indeed bury the dead man, but they do not put anyone
in with him. However, I have been told by tru^-
worthy persons in the Negrolands that the heathen
there, when their king died, used to make a na us
for him and put in with him some of his courtiers
and servants, along with thirty of the sons and daughters
of their principal families, fir^ breaking their hands and
feet, and they put in drinking vessels along with them.

When the Qan was slain, as we have related, and
his nephew Firfiz obtained the sovereign power, he
chose to make his capital at the city of Qaraqorum,
on account of its proximity to the territories of his
cousins, the kings of Turki^an and Transoxania.^®
Afterwards several of the amirs who were not present
when the Qan was killed revolted again^ him and
intercepted communications and the disorders grew
to serious proportions.

CHAPTER XII


When the revolt broke out and the flames of disorder
were kindled, Shaykh Burhdn ad-Dfn and others
advised me to return to [Southern] China before the
diilurbances became chronic. They presented them-
selves with me to the representatives of Sultan Fi'ruz,
who sent three of his suite to escort me and wrote
orders for my treatment as a gucSt [on the journey].
We travelled down the river to KhansS, and thence
to Qanjanfii and Zaytdn, and on reaching the lail
I found the junks ready to sail for India. Among^l
them was a junk belonging to al-Malik az-Zihir, the
ruler of Jdwa [Sumatra], the crew of which were
Muslims. His agent knew me and was delighted at
my arrival. .We sailed with fair winds for ten days,
but as we approached the land of TawdlisI, the wind
changed, the sky darkened, and it rained heavily. We
passed ten days without seeing the sun, and then
entered a sea which we did not know. The crew of
the junk became alarmed and wished to return to
China, but that was out of the queAion. We passed
forty-two days not knowing in what sea we were.

, On the forty-third day there was visible to us at
early dawn a mountain, projefling from the sea at
a distance of about twenty miles from us, and the wind
was carrying us straight towards it. The sailors were
puzzled and said “We are nowhere near land, and there
is no record of a mountain in the sea. If the wind
drives us on it we are lo^l.” So all on board began
to humble themselves and concentrate their thoughts
on God, and renew their repentance. We implored
301



SELECTIONS FROM THE

God in prayer and sought the mediation of his prophet
[Muhammad] — on whom be the Blessing and Peace
of God; the merchants vowed to distribute large sums
in alms, and I wrote down their vows for them in
a register with my own hand. The wind calmed a
little, and later on when the sun rose we saw that the
mountain had risen into the air, and that daylight
was visible between it and the sea. We were amazed
at this, and I saw the crew weeping, and taking fare-
well of one another. So I said “ What is the matter
with you They replied “ What we thought was.
a mountain is the Rukh, and if it sees us it will make
an end of us.”^ We were at that moment less than
ten miles away from it. JuSt then God of His mercy
sent us a favourable wind, which turned us in another
direSlion, so that we did not see it and could not
learn its true shape.

Two months after this we reached Jawa and landed
at [the town of] Sumutra. We found its sultan
al-Malik az-Zahir ju^ returned from a raid, with a
large train of captives. He sent me two girls and
two boys, and lodged me in the usual manner. ' I
was present at the marriage of his son to the daughter
of the sultan’s brother. After two months’ ^ay on
this island I took a passage on a junk. The sultan
on bidding me farewell, gave me a great deal of aloes-
wood, camphor, clpves, and sandalwood. I left him
and set sail, and after forty days reached Kawlam
[Quilon]. Here I disembarked and put up in
proximity to the qadi of the Muslims; this was in
Ramadan [January 1347] and I attended the festival
prayer in the cathedral mosque there. From Kawlam
we went on to Calicdt, and ^ayed there for some
days. I intended to return to Delhi, but on second
thoughts I had some fears about doing so, so I re-
embarked and twenty-eight days later I arrived at
Dhafdri (p. 1 1 3), that being in Muharram of the

302



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

year [seven hundred and] fortycight [end of April

1347 ]- ^

Thereafter I took ship and arrived at Mascat, a
small town in which there is a great abundance of the
fish called qulb aUmds (p. 242). Thence we sailed
to the ports of Qurayydt, Shabba, Kalba,* and Qalhdt,
which has been mentioned before [p. 1 18]. All these
towns form part of the province of Hormuz, though
they arc reckoned to be in the diifrift of ‘Omdn.
We- sailed on to Hormuz, and after spending three
nights there, travelled by land to KawrdAdn, Ldr, and
Khunjubdl — all of which have been mentioned before,
(p. 120) — thence to KdrzC,® where we flayed for three
nights, and so through a number of other towns and
villages to the city of Shfrdz. From Shirdz I travelled
to Isfahdn, and thence through Tuflar [Shushtar] to
Basra, where I visited the sacred tombs which arc
there, and so through Mash-had ‘AH [Najaf] and
Hilla to Baghddd, which I reached in Shawwdl of
the year 48 [January 1348]. I met there a man
from Morocco, who informed me of the disafler at
Tarifa, and of the capture of al-Khadrd [Algeciras]
by the Chriflians^ — may God repair the breach that
Isidm has suffered thereby I

The sultan of Baghddd and of 'Irdq at the time of
my arrival at the date mentioned was Shaykh Hasan,®
the cousin of the late Sultan Abii Sa'ld by his father’s
sifter. When Abd Sa‘fd died, he took possession
of his kingdom in ‘Irdq, and married his widow
Dilshdd, the daughter of Dimashq Khwdja, son of
the amir Chdbdn, jufl as Sultan Abd SaHd had done
in marrying Shaykh Hasan’s wife. Sultan Hasan
was away from Baghddd at this time, on his way to
fight Sultan Atdbeg Afrdsiydb, the ruler of the country
of Ldr.

After leaving Baghddd I travelled to the cip^ of
Anbdr, then successively to Hit, Haditha, and ‘Ana.®

SELECTIONS FROM THE

This is one of the richest and mo^ fertile in

• the world, and there are buildings all along the road
between these points, so that one walks as it were
through one [continuous] bazaar. We have already
said that we have seen nothing to equal the country
along the banks of the river of China, except this
di^ri6t. I came next to the town of Rahba, which
is the fineft town in ‘Iraq, and the frontier town of
Syria.'^ Thence we went on to as-Sukhna, a pretty
town,® inhabited mainly by infidels, that is Chrillians.
It is called as-Sukhna [“ the hot town ”] because of
the heat of its water, and contains bathhouses for men
and women. They draw their water by night and
put it on the roofs to cool. Thereafter we journeyed
to Tadmur [Palmyra], the city of the prophet Solomon,
which was built for him by the jinn,® and thence to
Damascus, which I thus revisited after twenty years’
absence. I had left a wife of mine there pregnant,
and I learned while I was in India that she had borne
a male child, whereupon I sent to the boy’s maternal
grandfather, who belonged to Miknasa [Mequinez]
in Morocco, forty gold dinars in Indian money. When
I arrived in Damascus on this occasion I had no
thought but to enquire after my son. I went to the
mosque, where by good fortune I found Ndr ad-Di'n
as-Sakhawi, the imam and principal [shaykh] of the
Malikites. I greeted him but he did not recognize
me, so I made myself known to him and asked him,
about the boy. He replied “ He is dead these twelve
years.” He told me that a scholar from Tangier
was living in the Zahiriya academy, so I went to see
him, to enquire after my father and relatives. I
found him to be a venerable shaykh, and when I had
greeted him and told him the name of my family he
informed me that my father had died fifteen years
before and that my mother was ^lill alive. I remained
at Damascus until the end of the year, though there

304



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

was a great scarcity of provisions and bread rose to
the price of seven ounces for a dirham nuqra [about
jdJ. Their ounce equals four Moroccan ounces.

On leaving Damascus I went to Aleppo, by way
of Hims, Hamdh, Ma'arra, and Sarmln. It happened
at this time that a certain danvish, known as the
Principal Shaykh, who lived on a hill outside the town
of ‘Ayntdb,*® where he used to be visited by the people
in search of the blessings he conveyed, having one
disciple attendant on him but [otherwise] a solitary
and unmarried, said in one of his discourses: “The
Prophet — may God bless him and give him pcacel —
could not do without women, but I can do without
them." Evidence to that effeft was brought again^
him and proved before a qddf, and the case was
referred to the commandcr-in-chicf. The shaykh
and his disciple, who had assented to his statement,
were brought up [for examination]; the principal
judges of the four rites decided on legal grounds
that both should be punished by death, and they were
duly executed.

Early in June we heard at Aleppo that the plague
had broken out at Gaza, and that the number of
deaths there reached over a thousand a day. On
travelling to Hims I found that the plague had broken
out there: about three hundred persons died of it on
the day that I arrived. So I went on to Damascus,
and arrived there on a Thursday. The inhabitants
had then been failing for three days; on the Friday
they went out to the mosque of the Footprints,
as we have related in the firil book, and God
eased them of the plague [p, 68], The number of
deaths among them reached a maximum of 2,400 a
day. Thereafter I journeyed to ‘Ajaldn and thence
to Jerusalem, where I found that the ravages of the
plague had ceased. We revisited Hebron, and thence
went to Gaza, the greater part of which we found
305 X



SELECTIONS FROM THE

deserted because of the number of those who died
there of the plague. I was told by the qadi that the
number of deaths there reached i,ioo a day. We
continued our journey overland to Damietta, and on
to Alexandria. Here we found that the plague was
diminishing in intensity, though the number of deaths
had previously reached a thousand and eighty a day.
I then travelled to Cairo, where I was told that the
number of deaths during the epidemic rose to twenty-
one thousand a day.^^ From Cairo I travelled
through the Sa‘id [Upper Egypt] to ‘Aydhab,
whence I took ship to Judda, and thence reached
Mecca on 22nd Sha‘ban of the year 49 [r6th
November 1348].

After the pilgrimage of this year [28th Feb. — 2nd
March 1349] I travelled with the Syrian caravan
to Tayba [Madina], thence to Jerusalem, and back
through Gaza to Cairo . Here we learned that through
our ma^er, the Commander of the Faithful, Abd
‘Inan (may God ^rengthen him I), God had united
the scattered forces of the House of Man'n^ and
healed by his blessing the we^ern lands when they
had all but succumbed. [We were told that] he had
poured out his bounty upon great and small, and
overwhelmed the whole nation by the torrent of his
favours, so that all hearts were filled with the desire
of landing at his gate and with the hope of kissing
his stirrup. Thereupon I decided to journey to his
illu^rious capital, moved also by the longing called
forth within me by memories of my home, by
yearning for my family and friends, and by love of
my country, wifiich surpasses in my eyes all other
countries.

I took ship on a small trading-vessel belonging to
a Tunisian in Safar of the year [April-May 1349],
and travelled to Jerba, where I disembarked. The
vessel went on to Tunis, and was captured by the

encmy.“ From Jcrba I went in a small boat to Qabis
[Gabes], where I put up as the gue^ of the two
illu^lrious brothers, Abu Marwdn and Abu’l-Abbas,
sons of Makkf, the governors of Jerba and Gabes.
I attended with them the fcdlLval of the birthday of
the Prophet [i2th Rabi L=3ist May]. Thereafter
I went bv boat to Safdqus [Sfax] and continued by
sea to Bulydna,^* from which point I travelled on land
in the company of the Arabs, and after some discom-
forts reached the city of Tunis'", at the time when it
was being besieged by the Arabs. I dlayed at Tunis
thirty-six days and then took ship with the Catalans.
We reached the island of Sarddniya [Sardinia], one
of the islands belonging to the ChriAians, where there
is a wonderful harbour, with great baulks of wood
m a circle round it and an entrance like a gateway,
which is opened only if they give permission.^ In
the island there are fortified towns; we went into one
of them, and [saw] in it a large number of bazaars.
I made a vow to God to fail for two successive months
if He should deliver us from this island, because we
found out that its inhabitants were proposing to pursue
us when we left to take us captive. We then sailed
away and ten days later reached the town of Tenes,
then Mdzdna, then Mudlaghdnim [Modlaganem],
and so to Tilimsdn [Tlemscn], I went to al-‘Ubbdd
and visited [the tomb of] Shaykh Ab\i Madin.^® I
left Tilimsdn by the Nadr^ima road, then took the
Akhandaqdn road, and spent the night at the hermi-
tage of Shaykh Ibrdhfm. We set out from there
and when we were near Azghanghdn'^ we were at-
tacked by fifty men on foot and two horsemen. I
had with me the pilgrim Ibn Qarf'dt of Tangier and
his brother Muhammad, who afterwards perished as
a martyr at sea. We resolved to make a fight for it
and put up a flag, whereupon they made peace with
us and we went with them, praise be to God. Thus

SELECTIONS FROM THE

we reached the town of Taza, where I learned the
news of my mother’s death of the plague — may God
Mo^l High have mercy on her. Then I set out
from Taza and arrived at the royal city of Fez on
Friday, at the end of the month of Sha'ban of the year
750 [13th November 1349].

I presented myself before our mo^ noble ma^er,
the mo^ generous imam, the Commander of the
Faithful, al-Mutawakkil Abd ‘Inan — ^may God enlarge
his greatness and humble his enemies. His dignity
made me forget the dignity of the sultan of ‘Iraq,
his beauty the beauty of the king of India, his fine-
qualities the noble charafter of the king of Yemen,
his courage the courage of the king of the Turks,
his clemency the clemency of the king of the Greeks,
his devotion the devotion of the king of Turki^an,
and his knowledge the knowledge of the king of
Jawa. I laid down the ^aff of travel in his glorious
land, having assured myself after unbiassed considera-
tion that it is the be^ of countries, for in it fruits
are plentiful, and running water and nourishing food
are never exhau^ed. Few indeed are the lands which
unite all these advantages, and well spoken are the
poet’s words ;

Of all the lands the Weft by this token’s the beft :

Here the full moon is spied and the sun speeds to reft.

The dirhams of the We^ are small, but their utility
is great. When you compare its prices with the prices
of Egypt and Syria, you will see the truth of my
contention, and realize the superiority of the Maghrib.
For I assure you that mutton in Egypt is sold at
eighteen ounces for a dirham nuqra^ which equals in
value six dirhams of the Maghrib,^® whereas in the
Maghrib- meat is sOld, when prices are high, at eighteen
ounces for two dirhams, that is a third of a nuqra.
As for melted butter, it is usually not to be found in

308



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

Egypt at all. The kinds of things that the Egyptians
cat along with their bread would not even be looked
at in the Maghrib. They consist for the mo^l part
of lentils and chickpeas, which they cook in enormous
cauldrons,'® and on which they put oil of sesame;
baiUlii^ a kind of peas which they cook and cat with
olive oil; gherkins, which they cook and mix with
curdled milk; purslane*® which they prepare in the
same way; the buds of almond trees, which they cook
and serve in curdled milk; and colocasia, which they
cook. All these things are easily come b^ in the
Maghrib, but God has enabled Its inhabitants to
dispense with them, by reason of the abundance of
fleshmeats, melted butter, fresh butter, honey, and
other produfb. As for green vegetables, they are
the rarcA of things in Egypt, and moA of their fruit
has to be brought from Syria. Grapes, when they
arc cheap, are sold amongA them at a dirham nuqra
for three of their pounds, their pound being twelve
ounces.

As for Syria, fruits arc indeed plentiful there, but
in the Maghrib they arc cheaper. Grapes are sold
there at the rate of one of their pounds for a dirham
nuqra (their pound is three Maghrib! pounds), and
when their price is low, two pounds tor a dirham
nuqra. Pomegranates and quinces arc sold at eight
fah [coppers] apiece, which equals a dirham of our
money. As for vegetables the quantity sold for a
dirham nuqra is less than that sold for a small dirham
in our country. Meat is sold there at the rate of one
Syrian pound for two and a half dirhams nuqra. If
vou consider all this, it will be clear to you that the
lands of the Maghrib arc the cheapest in co^l of living,
the mo^ abundant in good things, and bleft with the
greatest share of material comforts and advantages.
Moreover, God has augmented the honour and excel-
lence of the Maghrib by the imdmate of our mailer,

309



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

the Commander of the Faithful, who has spread the
shelter of security throughout its territories and made
the sun of equity to rise within its borders, who has
caused the clouds of beneficence to shed their rain
upon its dwellers in country and town, who has purified
it from evildoers, and e^ablished it in the ways alike
of worldly prosperity and of religious observance.






CHAPTER Xin


After I had been privileged to observe this noble
majeily and to share in the all-embracing bounty of
his beneficence, I set out to visit the tomb of my
mother. I arrived at my home town of Tangier and
visited her, and went on to the town of Sabta [Ceuta],
where I iiayed for some months. While I was there
I suffered from an illness for three months, but after-
wards God reilored me to health. I then proposed
to take part in the jiiJJ and the defence of the frontier,
so I crossed the sea from Ceuta in a barque belonging
to the people of Asild [Arzila], and reached the land
of Andalusia (may God Almighty guard herl) where
the reward of the dweller is abundant and a recom-
pense is laid up for the settler and visitor. This was
after the death of the Chriflian tyrant Adfiinus
fAIphonso XI.] and his ten-months' siege of the Jebel
[Gibraltar], when he thought that he would capture
ail that the Muslims dlill retain of Andalusia; but
God took him whence he did not reckon, and he,
who of all men flood in the mofl mortal terror of the
plague, died of it.‘ The firfl part of Andalusia that
I saw was the Mount of Conquefl [Gibraltar]. I
walked round the mountain and saw the marvellous
works executed on it by our mailer [the late Sultan
of Morocco] Abu'l-Hasan and the armament with
which he equipped it, together with the additions
made thereto by our mafler [Abii ‘InSn], may God
flrengthen him, and I should have liked to remain
as one of its defenders to the end of my days.

Ibn Juzayy adds: “The Mount of Conquefl is the
citadel of Islam, an obflruSion fluck in the throats
3 ”



SELECTIONS FROM THE

of the idolaters. From it began the great conque^
[of Spain by the Arabs], and at it disembarked Tariq
ibn Ziyad, the freedman of Miisa ibn Nusayr, when
he crossed [the strait in 7^^]* name was linked
with his, and it was called Jebel Tariq [The Mount
of Tariq]. It is called also the Mount of Conque^,
because the conque^ began there. The remains of
the wall built by Tariq and his army are ^ill in exig-
ence; they are known as the Wall of the Arabs, and
I myself have seen them during my ^ay there at the
time of the siege of Algeciras (may God re^ore it
[to Islam] !).

“ Gibraltar was recaptured by our late ma^er Abu’l-
Hasan, who recovered it from the hands of the Chris-
tians after they had possessed it for over twenty years.
He sent his son, the noble prince Abii Malik, to
besiege it, aiding him with large sums of money and
powerful armies. It was taken after a six months’
siege in the year 733 [1333 a.d.]. At that time it
was not in the present ^ate. Our late ma^er Abu’l-
Hasan built in it the huge keep at the top of the
fortress; before that it was a small tower, which was
laid in ruins by the atones from the catapults, and he
built the new one in its place. He built the arsenal
there too (for there was no arsenal in the place before),
as well as the great wall which surrounds the Red
Mound, Parting from the arsenal and extending to
the tileyard. Later on our ma^er, the Commander
of the Faithful, Abd ‘Inan (may God ^rengthen him)
again took in hand its fortification and embellishment,
and ^rengthened the wall of the extremity of the
mount, which is the mo^t formidable and useful of
its walls. He also sent thither large quantities of
munitions, food^uffs, and provisions of all kinds, and
thereby acquitted himself of his duty to God Mo^
High with singleness of purpose and sincere devotion.
His concern for the affairs of the Jebel reached such

312



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

lengths that he gave orders for the conAruftion of
a model of it, on which he had represented models
of its walls, towers, citadel, gates, arsenal, mosques,
munition-Aores, and corn-granaries, together with the
shape of the Jebcl itself and the adjacent Red Mound.
This model was executed in the palace precindls; it
was a marvellous likeness and a piece of fine crafts-
manship. Any one who has seen the Jebel and then
sees this copy will recogni2c its merit. This was due
solely to his eagerness (may God strengthen him) to
learn how matters Stood there, and his anxiety to
Strengthen its defences and equipment. May God
MoSl High grant victory to Isidm in the WeStern
Peninsula [Spain] at his hands, and bring to pass his
hope of conquering the lands of the infidels and
breaking the Strcngdi of the adorers of the cross.”

To resume the narrative of our Shaykh. I went
out of Gibraltar to the town of Ronda, one of the
strongest and moSt beautifully situated fortresses of
the Muslims. The qddf there was my cousin, the
doflor Abu’I-Qdsim Muhammad b. Yahyd Ibn Bat-
tiita. I Stayed at Ronda for five days, then went
on to the town of Marbala [Marbella]. The road
between these two places is difficult and exceedingly
rough. Marbala is a pretty little town in a fertile
diStrift. I found there a company of horsemen setting
out for Mdlaqa, and intended to go in their company,
but God by His grace preserved me, for they went
on ahead of me and were captured on the way, as we
shall relate. I set out after them, and when I had
traversed the diSlridt of Marbala, and entered the
diSlrift of SuhayP I passed a dead horse lying in the
ditch, and a little farther on a pannier of fish thrown
on the ground. This aroused my suspicions. In
front of me there was a watchtower, and I said to
myself “ If an enemy were to appear here, the man
on the tower would give the alarm.” So I went on

313



SELECTIONS, FROM THE

to a house thereabouts, and at it I found a horse
killed. While I was there I heard a shout behind
me (for I had gone ahead of my party) and turning
back to them, found the commander , of the fort of
Suhayl with them. He told me that four galleys
belonging to the enemy had appeared there, and a
number of the men on board had landed when the
watchman was not in the tower. The horsemen who
had ju^t left Marbala, twelve in number, had en-
countered this raiding force. The Chri^ians had
killed one of them, one had escaped, and ten were
taken prisoner. A fisherman was killed along with
them, and it was he whose basket I had found lying
on the road.

The officer advised me to spend the night with him
in his quarters, so that he could escort me thence to
Malaqa. I passed the night in the ca^le of the regi-
ment of mounted frontiersmen called the Suhayl
regiment. All this time the galleys of which we have
spoken were lying close by. On the morrow he rode
with me and we reached Malaqa, which is one of the
larged and mo^ beautiful towns of Andalusia. It
unites the conveniences of both sea and. land, and is
abundantly supplied with food^uffs and fruits. I
saw grapes being sold in its bazaars at the rate of
eight pounds for a small dirham, and its ruby-coloured
Murcian pomegranates have no equal in the world.
As for figs and almonds, they are exported from
Malaqa and its outlying di^ridls to the lands both
of the Ea^t and the We^t. At Malaqa there is manu-
failured excellent gilded pottery, which is exported
thence to the moft distant lands. Its mosque covers
a large area and has a reputation for sandlity; the court
of the mosque is of unequalled beauty, and contains
exceptionally tall orange trees.

On my arrival at Malaqa I found the qddf sitting
in the great mosque, along with the doftors of the

314



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

law and the principal inhabitants, all engaged in
coUc(5ting money to ransom the prisoners of whom
we have spoken. I said to him ‘"Praise be to God,
Who hath preserved me, and hath not made me one
of them.” 1 told him what had happened to me after
they had gone, and he marvelled at it and sent me a
hospitality-gifr, as also did the preacher of the town.

hrom Mdlaqa I journeyed to the town of Ballash
[Velcj], a di^ance of twenty-four miles. Ballash is
a fine town with a magnificent mosque; grapes, fruits,
and figs are ju^ as plentiful there as at Mdlaqa. We
went on from there to al-Hamma [Alhama], which is
a small town with a mo^ clcgajit mosque in a fine
situation. Near by, at a di^lance of a mile or so from
the town, is the hot spring [from which the town
derives its name],* on the bank of the river. There
is a bathhouse here for men and another for women.

Thence I went to on the city of Gharndta [Granada],
the metropolis of Andalusia and the bride of its cities.
Its environs have not their equal in any country in
the world. They extend for the space of forty miles,
and arc traversed by the celebrated river of Shannil
[Xcnil] and many other breams. Around it on every
side are orchards, gardens, flowery meads, noble
buildings, and vineyards. One of the mo^l beautiful
places there is ad-dama* [the Fountain of Tears],*
which is a hill covered with gardens and orchards and
has no parallel in any other country. The king of
Gharndta at the time of my visit was Sultan Abu’l-
Hajjdj Yiisuf. I did not meet him on account of an
illness from which he was suffering,® but the noble,
pious, and virtuous woman, his mo&cr, sent me some
gold dinars, of which I made good use.

1 met at Gharndta a number of its di^ingUished
scholars and the principal Shaykh, who is dso the
superior of the Sdff orders. I spent some days with
him in his hermitage outside Gharndta. He showed

315



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

me the greater honour and went with me to visit
the hospice, famed for its sandlity, known as the
Outpoll of al-Uqdb [the Eagle]. Al-‘Uqab is a hill
overlooking the environs of Gharnata, about eight
miles from the city and close by the ruined city of
al-Bira.® There is also at Gharnata a company of
Persian darwishes, who have made their homes there
because of its resemblance to their native lands. One
is from Samarqand, another from Tabriz, a third from
Quniya [Konia], one from Khurasan, two from India,
and so on.

On leaving Gharnata I travelled back through
al-Hamma, Ballash, and Malaqa, to the cattle of
Dhakwan, which is a fine fortress with abundant
water, trees, and fruits."^ From there I went to
Ronda and on to Gibraltar, where I embarked on the
ship by which I had crossed before, and which belonged
to the people of Asila [Arzila]. I arrived at Sabta
[Ceuta] and went on to Asila, where I ^ayed for
some months. Thence I travelled to Sala [Sallee, by
Rabat] and from there reached the city of Marrakush.
It is one of the mpft beautiful of cities, spaciously
built and extending over a wide area, with abundant
supplies. It contains magnificent mosques, such as
its principal mosque, known as the Mosque of the
Kutubiyin [the Booksellers]. There is a marvellously
tall minaret there; I climbed it and obtained a view
of the whole town from it. The town is now largely
in ruins, so that I could compare it only to Baghdad,
though the bazaars in Baghdad are finer.® At Mar-
rakush too there is a splendid college, distinguished
by its fine site and solid conStrudtion ; it was built
by our maSter, the Commander of the Faithful,
Abu’l-FIasan [the late sultan of Morocco].


316



CHAPTER XIV


From Marrdkush I travelled with the suite of our
mailer [the Sultan] to Fez, where I took leave of our
mailer and set out for the Kegrolands. I reached the
town of Sijilmdsa, a very fine town, with quantities
of excellent dates. ‘ The City of Ihsra rivals it in
abundance of dates, but the Sijilmdsa dates .arc better,
and the kind called irJ,r has no equal in the world.
1 ilayed there with the learned Abfi Muhammad
al-Bushrl, the man whose brother I met in the city
of Qanjanfu in China. How ilrangcly separated they
arc 1 He showed me the utmoil honour.

At Sijilmdsa I bought c.imels and a four months'
supply of forage for them. Thereupon I set out on
the lA Muharram of the year [seven hundred and]
fift\'-ihrcc [i8th Februar)' I3J2] with a caravan
including, amongA others, a number of the merchants
of Sijilmdsa. After twenty-five days we reached
Taghdzd, an unattraAive village, with the curious
feature that its houses and mosques arc built of blocks
of salt, roofed with camel skins. There arc no trees
there, nothing but sand. In the sand is a salt mine;
they dig for the salt, and find it in thick slabs, lying
one on top of the other, as though they had been
tool-squared and laid under the surface of the earth."
A camel will carry two of these slabs. No one lives
at Taghdzd except the slaves of the Massfifa tribe,
who dig for the salt; they subsiA on dates imported
from Dar'a* and Sijilmdsa, camels’ flesh, and millet
imported from the Ncgrolands. The negroes come
up from their country and take away the salt from there.

317



SELECTIONS FROM THE

At Iwdlatan a load of salt brings eight to ten mithqdls\-
in the town of Malli it sells for twenty to thirty, and
sometimes as much as forty. The negroes use salt
as a medium of exchange, ju^l as gold and silver is
used [elsewhere]; they cut it up into pieces and buy
and sell with it. The business done at Taghaza, for
all its meanness, amounts to an enormous figure in
terms of hundredweights of gold-du^."*

We passed ten days of discomfort there, because
the water is brackish and the place is plagued with
flies. Water supplies are laid in at Taghaza for the
crossing of the desert which lies beyond it, which is
a ten-nights’ journey with no water on the way except
on rare occasions. We indeed had the good fortune
to find water in plenty, in pools left by the rain. One
day we found a pool of sweet water between two
rocky prominences. We quenched our thiril at it
and then washed our clothes. Truffles are plentiful
in this desert and it swarms with lice, so that people
wear ^ring necklaces containing mercury, which kills
them. At that time we used to go ahead of the caravan,
and when we found a place suitable for pasturage we
would graze our bea^s. We went on doing this until
one of our party was lo^ in the desert; after that I
neither went ahead nor lagged behind. We passed
a caravan on the way and they told us that some of
their party had become separated from them. We
found one of them dead under a shrub, of the sort
that grows in the sand, with his clothes on and a whip
in his hand. The water was only about a mile away
from him.

We came next to Tasarahla, a place of subterranean
water-beds, where the caravans halt.® They ^ay
there three days to re^t, mend their waterskins, fill
them with water, and sew on them covers of sack-
cloth as a precaution again^ the wind. From this
point the takshif is despatched. The takshif is a name

318



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

given to any man of the MassUfa tribe who is hired
by the persons in the caravan to go ahead to Iwdldtan,
carrying letters from them to their friends there, so
that they may take lodgings for them. These persons
then come out a di^ance of four nights' journey to
meet the caravan, and bring water with them. Anyone
who has no friend in IwdUtan writes to some merchant
well known for his worthy charaftcr, who then under-
takes the same services for him. It often happens
that the tahklf perishes in this desert, with the result
that the people of Iwdidtan know nothing about the
caravan, and all or moA of those who arc with it
perish. That desert is haunted hy demons; if the
tahhlf be alone, they make sport of him and disorder
his mind, so that he loses his way and perishes. For
there is no visible road or track in these parts —
nothing but s.and blown hither and thither by the wind.
You see hills of sand in one place, and afterwards you
will see them moved to quite another place. The guide
there is one who has made the journey frequently in
both direftions, and who is gifted with a quick intel-
ligence. I remarked, as a dirangc thing, that the guide
whom we had was blind in one eye, and diseased in
the other, yet he had the bc^ knowledge of the road
of any man. We hired the tahhlf on this journey for
a hundred gold mithqdls\ he was a man of the Massiifi.
On the night of the seventh day [from Tdsarahli]
we saw with joy the fires of the party who had come
out to meet us.

Thus we reached the town of Iwdldtan [WalataJ
after a journey from Sijilmdsa of two months to a
day.® Iwdldtan is the northernmodl province of the
negroes, and the sultan’s representative there was one
Farbd Husayn, farbd meaning deputy [in their lan-
guage]. When we arrived there, the merchants
deposited their goods in an open square, where the
blacks undertook to guard them, and went to the

Jarhd, He was sitting on a carpet under , an archway,
with his guards before him carrying lances and bows
in their hands, and the headmen of the Massdfa behind
him. The merchants remained landing in front of
him while he spoke to them through an interpreter,
although they were close to him, to show his contempt
for them. It was then that I repented of having come
to their country, because of their lack of manners and
their contempt for the whites.

I went to visit Ibn Badda, a worthy man of Sala
[Sallee, Rabat], to whom I had written requesting
him to hire a house for me, and who had done so.
Later on the mtishrif [inspedtor] of Iwalatan, whose
name was Mansha Jd, invited all those who had come
with the caravan to partake of his hospitality. At
firSt I refused to attend, but my companions urged
me very Strongly, so I went with the reSt. The repaSt
was served — some pounded millet mixed with a little
honey and milk, put in a half calabash shaped like a
large bowl. The gueSts drank and retired. I said
to them “ Was it for this that the black invited us
They answered “Yes; and it is in their opinion the
highest form of hospitality.” This convinced me that
there was no good to be hoped for from these people,
and I made up my mind to travel [back to Morocco
at once] with the pilgrim caravan from Iwalatan.
Afterwards, however, I thought it beSt to go to see
the capital of their king [at Mali!].

My Stay at Iwalatan laSted about fifty days; and I
was shown honour and entertained by its inhabitants.
It is an excessively hot place, and boaSts a few small
date-palms, in the shade of which they sow water-
melons. Its water comes from underground water-
beds at that point, and there is plenty of mutton to
be had. The garments of its inhabitants, moSl of
whom belong to the Massfifa tribe, are of fine Egyptian
fabrics. Their women are of surpassing beauty, and

320



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

are shown more respeft than the men. The ^late of
affairs among^l these people is indeed extraordinary.
Their men show no signs of jealousy whatever; no
one claims descent from his father, but on the contrary
from his mother’s brother. A ^rson's heirs arc his
sifter’s sons, not his own sons. This is a thing which
1 have seen nowhere in the world except among the
Indians of Malabar. But those are heathens; these
people arc Muslims, punctilious in observing the hours
of prayer, studying books of law, and memorizing
the Koran. Yet their women show no bashfulness
before men and do not veil themselves, though they
arc assiduous in attending the prayers. Any man
who wishes to marry one of them may do so, but they
do not travel with their husbands, and even if one
desired to do so her family would not allow her to go.

The women there have “ friends " and “ com-
panions ” amongft the men outside their own families,
and the men in the same way have “ companions ”
amongfl the women of other families. A man may
go into his house and find his wife entertaining her
“companion” but he takes no objcClion to it. One
day at Iwdldtan I went into the qddi’s house, after
asking his permission Co enter, and found with him
a young woman of remarkable beauty. When I saw
her I was shocked and turned to go out, but she
laughed at me, inflead of being overcome by shame,
and the qddf said to me “ Why are you going out ?
She is my companion.” I was amazed at their con-
duct, for he was a theologian and a pilgrim to boot.

I was told that he had asked the sultan’s permission
to make the pilgrimage that year with his “com-
panion ” (whether this one or not I cannot say) but
the sultan would not grant it.

When I decided to make the journey to MdlH,
which is reached in twenty*four days from Iwalatan
if the traveller pushes on rapidly, I hired a guide from

SELECTIONS FROM THE

the Massiifa (for there is no necessity to travel in a
company on account of the safety of that road), and
set out with three of my companions. On the way
there are many trees, and these trees are of great age
and girth; a whole caravan may shelter in the shade
of one of them. There are trees which have neither
branches nor leaves, yet the shade ca^t by their trunks
is sujfHcient to shelter a man. Some of these trees are
rotted in the interior and the rain-water colledls in
them, so that they serve as wells and the people drink
of the water inside them."^ In others there are bees
and honey, which is colledled by the people. I was
surprised to find inside one tree, by which I passed,
a man, a weaver, who had set up his loom in it and
was aftually weaving.

A traveller in this country carries no provisions,
whether plain food or seasonings, and neither gold
nor silver. He takes nothing but pieces of salt and
glass ornaments, which the people call beads, and some
aromatic goods. When he comes to a village the
womenfolk of the blacks bring out millet, milk,
chickens, pulped lotus fruit, rice, funi. (a grain re-
sembling mu^ard seed, from which kuskusu^ and gruel
are made), and pounded haricot beans. The traveller
buys what of these he wants, but their rice causes
sickness to whites when it is eaten, and the funi is
preferable to it.

Ten days after leaving Iwalatan we came to the
village of Zaghari, a large village,® inhabited by negro
traders called wanjardtaf^ along with whom live a
community of whites of the ‘Ibadite It is

from this village that millet is carried to Iwalatan.
After leaving Zaghari we came to the great river, that
is the Nile, on which ^ands the town of Karsakhii.^
The Nile flows from there down to Kabara, and thence
to Zagha.^^ In both Kabara and Zagha there are
sultans who owe allegiance to the king of Malli. The

SELECTIONS FROM THE

I flopped at the cemetery and went to the quarter
occupied by the whites, where I asked for Muhammad
ibn al-Faqih. I found that he had hired a house for
me and went there. His son-in-law brought me
candles and food, and next day Ibn al-Faqih himself
came to visit me, with other prominent residents. I
met the qadi of Malli, ‘Abd ar-Rahman, who came to
see me; he is a negro, a pilgrim, and a man of fine
character. I met also the interpreter Diagha, who is
one of the principal men among the blacks.^® All
these persons sent me hospitality-gifts of food and
treated me with the utmo^ generosity — ^may God
reward them for their kindnesses ! Ten days after
our arrival we ate a gruel made of a root resembling
colocasia, which is preferred by them to all other
dishes. We all fell ill — there were six of us — and
one of our number died. I for my part went to the
morning prayer and fainted there. I asked a certain
Egyptian for a loosening remedy and he gave me a
thing called baydar^ made of vegetable roots, which he
mixed with aniseed and sugar, and birred in water.
I drank it off and vomited what I had eaten, together
with a large quantity of bile. God preserved me
from death but I was ill for two months.

The sultan of MalH is Mansa Sulayman, mansd
meaning [in Mande] sultan, and Sulayman being his
proper name.^^ He is a miserly king, not a man
from whom one might hope for a rich present. It
happened that I spent these two months without
seeing him, on account of my illness. Later on he
held a banquet in commemoration of our master [the
late sultan of Morocco] Abu’l-Hasan, to which the
commanders, dodlors, qadi and preacher were invited,
and I went along with them. Reading-desks were
brought in, and th^e Koran was read through, then they
prayed for our ma^er Abu’l-Hasan and also for Mansa
Sulayman. When the ceremony was over I went

324

forward and saluted Mansi Sulaymdn. The qddf,
the preacher, and Ibn al-Faqlh told him who I was,
and he answered them in their tongue. They said
to me “ The sultan says to you * Give thanks to God,* ”
so I said “Praise be to God and thanks under all
circumstances.’’^

When I withdrew the [sultan’s] hospitality gift was
sent to me. It was taken firSt to the qidf’s house, and
the qddi sent it on with his men to Ibn at-Faqih’s
house. Ibn al-Faqih came hurrying out of his house
bare-footed, and entered my room saying “ Stand up;
here comes the sultan’s ituff and gift to you.’’ So I
dlood up thinking [since he had called it “ dtuff ’’]
that it considled of robes of honour and money, and
lol it was three cakes of bread, and a piece of beef
fried in native oil, and a calabash of sour curds. When
I saw this 1 burii out laughing, and thought it a modi
amazing thing that they could be so foolish and make
so much of such a paltry matter.

For two months after this hospitality gift was sent
to me I received nothing further from the sultan,
and then followed the month of Ramaddn. Mean-
while I used to go frequently to the palace where I
would salute him and sit alongside the qddi and
the preacher. I had a conversation with Dughd
the interpreter, and he said “ Speak in his presence,
and I sh^l express on your behalf what is necessary.”
When the sultan held an audience early in Ramaddn,
I rose and dlood before him and said to him: “ I have
travelled through the countries of the world and have
met their kings. Here have I been four months in
your country, yet you have neither shown me hospi-
tality, nor given me anything. What am I to say
of you before [other] rulers ?” The sultan replied
“ I have not seen you, and have not been told about
you.” The qddf and Ibn al-Faqfh rose and replied
to him, saying “ He has already saluted you, and you
3^S



SELECTIONS FROM THE

have sent him food.” Thereupon he gave orders to
set apart a house for my lodging and to pay me a
daily sum for my expenses. Later on, on the night
of the 27th Ramadan, he distributed a sum of money
which they call the Zakdh [alms] between the qadi,
the preachers, and the doctors He gave me a
portion along with them of thirty-three and a third
mithqalsj and on my departure from Malli he beStowed
on me a gift of a hundred gold mithqdls.

On certain days the sultan holds audiences in the
palace yard, where there is a platform under a tree,
with three Steps; this they call the pempi^^ It is
carpeted with silk and has cushions placed on it.
[Over it] is raised the umbrella, which is a sort of
pavilion made of silk, surmounted by a bird in gold,
about the size of a falcon. The sultan comes out of
a door in a corner of the palace, carrying a bow in
his hand and a quiver on his back. On his head he
has a golden skull-cap, bound with a gold band which
has narrow ends shaped like .knives, more than a
span in length. His usual dress is a velvety red
tunic, made of the European fabrics called mutanfas.
The sultan is preceded by his musicians, who carry
gold and silver guimbris [two-^ringed guitars], and
behind him come three hundred armed slaves. He
walks in a leisurely fashion, affedting a very slow move-
ment, and even ^ops from time to time. On reaching
the pempi he ^ops and looks round the assembly, then
ascends it in the sedate manner of a preacher ascending
a mosque-pulpit. As he takes his seat the drums,
trumpets, and bugles are sounded. Three slaves go
out at a run to summon the sovereign’s deputy and
the military commanders, who enter and sit down.
Two saddled and bridled horses are brought, along with
two goats, which they hold’ to serve as a proteftion
againft the evil eye. Ddgha ^ands at the gate and the
re^ of the people remain in the ^reet, under the trees.

The negroes arc of all people the moil submissive
to their king and the moil aojcfl in their behaviour
before him. They swear by his name, saying Mausd
SuUymdn It he summons any of them while
he is holding an audience in his pavilion, the person
summoned takes oiT his clothes and puts on worn
garments, removes his turban and dons a dirty skull-
cap, and enters with his garments and trousers raised
knee-high. He goes forward in an attitude of humility
and deje^ion, and knocks the ground hard with his
elbows, then ilands with bowed head and bent back
liAcning to what he says. If anyone addresses the
king and receives a reply from him, he uncovers his
back and throws duR over his head and back, for all
the world like a bather splashing himself with water.
I used to wonder how it was they did not blind them-
selves. If the sultan deUvers any remarks durinc his
audience, those present take off their turbans and put
them down, and liAen in silence to what he says.
Sometimes one of them Aands up before him and recalls
his deeds in the sultan's service, saying “ I did so-and-
so on such a day ” or ** I killed so-and-so on such a
day,” Those who have knowledge of this confirm
his words, which they do by plucking the cord of the
bow and releasing it [with a twang], ju^l as an archer
docs when shooting an arrow. If the sultan says
** Truly spoken ” or thanks him, he removes his
clothes and “ du5ls.” That is their idea of good
manners.

Ibn Juzayy adds: ” I have been told that when the
pilgrim Miisd al-Wanjardtl [the Mandingo] came to
our madlcr Abu’l-Hasan as envoy from Mansd Sulay-
mdn, one of his suite carried with him a basketful of
duil when he entered the noble audience-hall, and
the envoy ‘ dueled * whenever our mailer spoke a
gracious word to him, juH as he would do in his own
country.”

I was at Main during the two fe^ivals of the sacri-
fice and the fa^-breaking. On these days the sultan
takes his seat on the pempi after the midafternoon
prayer. The armour-bearers bring in magnificent
arms — quivers of gold and silver, swords ornamented
with gold and with golden scabbards, gold and silver
lances, and crystal maces. At his head ^land four
amirs driving off the flies, having in their hands silver
ornaments resembling saddle-^irrups. The com-
manders, qadi, and preacher sit in their usual places.
The interpreter Ddgha comes with his four wives and
his slave-girls, who are about a hundred in number.
They are wearing beautiful robes, and on their heads
they have gold and silver fillets, with gold and silver
balls attached. A chair is placed for Diagha to sit
on. He plays on an in^rument made of reeds, with
some small calabashes at its lower end, and chants a
poem in praise of the sultan, recalling his battles and
deeds of valour. The women and girls sing along
with him and play with bows. Accompanying them
are about thirty youths, wearing red woollen tunics
and white skull-caps ; each of them has his drum slung
from his shoulder and beats it. Afterwards come his
boy pupils who play and turn wheels in the air, like
the natives of Sind. They show a marvellous nimble-
ness and agility in these exercises and play mo^l
cleverly with swords. Dfigha also makes a fine play
with the sword. Thereupon the sultan orders a gift
to be presented to Dfigha and he is given a purse
containing two hundred mithqdls of gold du^, and is
informed of the contents of the purse before all the
people. The commanders rise and twang their bows
in thanks to the sultan. The next day each one of
them gives Dfigha a gift, every man according to his
rank. Every Friday after the ^asr prayer, Dfigha
carries out a similar ceremony to this that we have
described.

On fcaR>days, after Dughd has finished his display^
the poets come in. Each of them is inside a figure
resembling a thrush) made of featherS) and provided
with a wooden head with a red beak, to look like a
thrush's head. They fland in front of the sultan in
this ridiculous make-up and recite their poems. I
was told that their poetry ts a kind of sermonizing
in which they say to the sultan: “ Tliis pempi which
pu occupy was that whereon sat this king and that
King, and such and such w*crc this one’s noble af^ions
and such and such the other's. So do you too do good
deeds whose memory will outlive you.” After that,
the chief of the poets mounts the Aeps of the pempi
and lays his head on the sultan's lap, then climbs to
the top of the pempi and lays his head firA on the
sultanas right shoulder and then on his left, speaking
all the while in their tongue, and finally he comes
down again* I was told that this praflice is a very
old cuAom amongil them, prior to the introduiflion
of Islim, and that they have kept it up.“

The negroes disliked Mansd Sulaymdn because of
his avarice. His predecessor was Mansd Maghd, and
before him reigned Mansd Mdsd, a generous and
virtuous prince, who loved the whites and made gifts
to them.” It w’as he who gave Abii Ishdq as-SdhiII“
four thousand mithaJls in the course of a single day.

I heard from a trURworthy source that he gave three
thousand mith^dh on one day to Mudrik ibn Faqqds,
by whose grandfather his own grandfather, Sdraq
Jdta, had been converted to Isidm.

The negroes possess some admirable qualities.
They arc seldom unjufl, and have a greater abhorrence
of injuflicc than any other people. Their sultan
shows no mercy to anyone who is guilty of the Ica^l
aft of it. There is complete security in their country.
Neither traveller nor inhabitant in it has anything to
fear from robbers or men of violence. They do not

329



SELECTIONS FROM THE.

confiscate the property of any white man who dies
in their country, even if it be uncounted wealth. On
the contrary, they give it into the charge of some
tru^worthy person among the whites, until the rightful
heir takes possession of it. They are careful to observe
the hours of prayer, and assiduous in attending them
in congregations, and in bringing up their children
to them. On Fridays, if a man does not go early
to the mosque, he cannot find a corner to pray in, on
account of the crowd. It is a cuilom of theirs to
send each man his boy [to the mosque] with his
prayer-mat; the boy spreads it out for his ma^er in
a place befitting him [and remains on it] until he comes
to the mosque. Their prayer-mats are made of the
leaves of a tree resembling a date-palm, but without
fruit.

Another of their good qualities is their habit of
wearing clean white garments on Fridays. Even if
a man has nothing but an old worn shirt, he washes
it and cleans it, and wears it to the Friday service.
Yet another is their zeal for learning the Koran by
heart. They put their children in chains if they show
any backwardness in memorizing it, and they are not
set free until they have it by heart. I visited the qadi
in his house on the day of the festival. His children
were chained up, so I said to him “ Will you not let
them loose ?’* He replied I shall not do so until
they learn the Koran by heart.” Among their bad
qualities are the following. The women servants,
slave-girls, and young girls go about in front of every-
one naked, without a ^itch of clothing on them.
Women go into the sultan’s presence naked and without
coverings, and his daughters also go about naked.
Then there is their cu^om of putting du^ and ashes
on their heads, as a mark of respeft, and the grotesque
ceremonies we have described when the poets recite
their verses. Another reprehensible pradlice among

330



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

many of them is the eating of carrion, dogs, and
asses.

The date of my arrival at MdlH was 14th Jumdda I.,
[seven hundred and] fifty-three [28th June 1352] and
of my departure from it 22nd Muharram of the year
fifty-four [27th February 1353], I was accompanied
by a merchant called Abii Bakr ibn Ya'qdb, We took
the Mima road. I had a camel which I was riding,
because horses are expensive, and coft a hundred
mlthqdh each. We came to a wide channel which
flows out of the Nile and can only be crossed in boats.
The place is infedled with mosquitoes, and no one can
pass that way except by night. We reached the
channel three or four hout^ after nightfall on a moon-
lit night. On reaching it I saw sixteen beails with
enormous bodies, and marvelled at them, taking them
to be elephants, of which there are many in that
country. Afterwards I saw that they had gone into
the river, so I said to Abd Bakr “What kind of
animals are these ?” He replied “ They are hippo-
potami which have come out to pasture ashore.” They
are bulkier than horses, have manes and tails, and
their heads are like horses* heads, but their feet like
elephants’ feet. I saw these hippopotami again when
we sailed down the Nile from Tumbuktii to Gawgaw.
They were swimming in the water, and lifting their
heads and blowing. The men in the boat were afraid
of them and kept close to the bank in case the hippo-
potami should sink them.

They have a cunning method of catching these
hippopotami. They use spears with a hole bored
in them, through which strong cords are passed. The
spear is thrown at one of the animals, and if it trikes
its leg or neck it goes right through it. Then they
pull on the rope until the beaft is brought to the bank,
kill it and eat its flesh. Along the bank there are
quantities of hippopotamus bones.

SELECTIONS FROM THE

We halted near this channel at a large village,
which had as governor a negro, a pilgrim, and man
of fine charafter, named Farba Magha. He was
one of the negroes who made the pilgrimage in the
company of Sultan Mansa Mfisa. Farba Maghd
told me that when Mansa Mdsa came to this channel,
he had with him a qadi, a white man. This qadf
attempted to make away with four thousand mithqdls
and the sultan, on learning of it, was enraged at him
and exiled him to the country of the heathen cannibals.
He lived among them for four years, at the end of
which the sultan sent him back to his own country.
The reason why the heathens did not eat him was
that he was white, for they say that the white is in-
dige^ible because he is not “ ripe,’* whereas the black
man is “ ripe ” in their opinion.

Sultan Mansa Sulayman was visited by a party of
these negro cannibals, including one of their amirs.
They have a cullom of wearing in their ears large
pendants, each pendant having an opening of half
a span. They wrap themselves in silk mantles, and
in their country there is a gold mine. The sultan
received them with honour, and gave them as his
hospitality-gift a servant, a negress. They killed and
ate her, and having smeared their faces and hands
with her blood came to the sultan to thank him. I
was informed that this is their regular cu^om whenever
they visit his court. Someone told me about them
that they say that the choicest parts of women’s flesh
are the palm of the hand and the breast.

We continued our journey from this village which
is by the channel, and came to the town of Quri
Mansa.^® At this point the camel which I was riding
died. Its keeper informed me of its death, but when
I went out to see it, I found that the blacks had already
eaten it, according to their usual custom of eating
carrion. I sent two lads whom I had hired for my

332



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

service to buy me a camel at Zagharl, and waited at
Qurf Mansd for six days till they returned with it.

I travelled next to the town of Mima and halted
by some wells in its outskirts,^ Thence we went
on to Tumbuktd, which stands four miles from the
river. Mo^ of its inhabitants are of the Massdfa
tribe, wearers of the face-veil. Its governor is called
Farbd Mdsd. I was present with him one day when
he had ju5l appointed one of the Massdfa to be amir
of a seftion. He assigned to him a robe, a turban,
and trousers, all of them of dyed cloth, and bade him
sit upon a shield, and the chiefs of his tribe raised him
on their heads. In this town is the grave of the
meritorious poet Abd Ishdq as-Sdhill, of Gharndta
[Granada], who is known in his own land as at-Tu-
wagin [“ Little Saucepan ”].®*

rrom Tumbuktd I sailed down the Nile on a small
boat, hollowed out of a single piece of wood. We
used to go ashore every night at the villages and buy
whatever we needed in the way of meat and butter
in exchange for salt, spices, and glass beads. I then
came to a place the name of which I have forgotten,
where there was an excellent governor, a pilgrim,
called Farbd Sulayman. He is famous for his courage
and strength, and none ventures to pluck his bow.

1 have not seen anyone among the blacks taller or
bulkier than him. At this town I was in need of some
millet, so I visited him (it was on the Prophet’s birth-
day) and saluted him. He took me by the hand, and
led me into his audience hall. We were served with
a drink of theirs called daqnu^ which is water con-
taining some pounded millet mixed with a little honey
or milk. They drink this in place of water, because
if they drink plain water it upsets them. If they have
no millet they mix the water with honey or milk.
Afterwards a green melon was brought in and we ate
some of it.


333



SELECTIONS FROM THE

A young boy, not yet full-grown, came in, and Farba
Sulayman, calling him, said to me “ Here is your
hospitality-gift ; keep an eye on him in case he escapes.”
So I took the boy and prepared to withdraw, but he
said “ Wait till the food comes.” A slave-girl of his
joined us; she was an Arab girl, of Damascus, and she
spoke to me in Arabic. While this was going on
we heard cries in his house, so he sent the girl to find
out what had happened. She returned to him and
told him that a daughter of his had ju^ died. He
said “ I do not like crying, come, we shall walk to
the river,” meaning the Nile, on which he has some
houses. A horse was brought, and he told me to
ride, but I said “ I shall not ride if you are walking,”
so we walked together. We came to his houses by
the Nile, where food was served, and after we had
eaten I took leave of him and withdrew. I met no
one among the blacks more generous or upright than
him. The boy whom he gave me is ^ill with me.

I went on from there to Gawgaw [Gogo], which is
a large city on the Nile, and one of the fine^ towns
in the Negrolands.^^ It is also one of their bigge^
and be^-provisioned towns, with rice in plenty, milk,
and fish, and there is a species of cucumber there called
'‘indni which has no equal. The buying and selling
of its inhabitants is done with cowry-shells, and the
same is the case at MalH.®^ I ^ayed there about
a month, and then set out in the direftion of Tagadda
by land with a large caravan of merchants from
Ghadamas. Their guide and leader was the pilgrim
Wuchm, which means “wolf” in the language of the
blacks. I had a riding-camel and a she-camel to
carry my provisions, but when we had travelled the
fir^ ^age, the she-camel could go no farther. So the
pilgrim Wuchin took what was on it and diftributed
it among^ his party, each of whom undertook to carry
a part of it. There was in the company a Maghrabin

334



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

belonging to TadaU, who refused to carry any of it
at all, as the re^l had done. My boy was thir^ one
day, and I asked this man for water, but he would
not give it.

We now entered the territory of the Barddma, who
are a tribe of Berbers. No caravan can travel [through
their country] without a guarantee of their proteftion,
"and for this purpose a woman’s guarantee is of more
value than a man's. Their women are the modf
perfect in beauty and the mo^ shapely in figure of
all women, of a pure white colour and very dlout;
nowhere in the world have I seen any who equal them
in dloutness.®^ I fell ill in this country on account
of the extreme heat, and a surplus of bile. We pushed
on rapidly with our journey until we reached Tagadda,
The houses at Tagaddd arc built of red ilone, and its
water runs by the copper mines, so that both its colour
and tadle are affe^ea. There are no grain crops there
except a little wheat, which is consumed by merchants
and dlrangers. The inhabitants of Tagaddd have no
occupation except trade, Th^ travel to Egypt every
year, and import quantities of all the fine fabrics to
be had there and of other Egyptian wares. They live
in luxury and ease, and vie with one another in regard
to the number of their slaves and serving-women.
The people of Malh' and Iwdlatan do the same. They
never sell the educated female slaves, or but rarely
and at a high price.®®

When I arrived at Tagadda I wished to buy an
educated female slave, but could not find one. After
a while the qddf sent me one who belonged to a friend
of his, and I bought her for twenty-five mithgdis.
Later on her mailer repented [of having sold her]
and wished to have the sale rescinded, so I said to
him “ If you can show me where to find another, I
shall cancel it for you.” He suggested a servant
belonging to ‘AU AghyijI, who was that very Maghrabin
335



SELECTIONS FROM THE

from Tadala who had refused to carry any of my
effedls when my camel broke down, and to give my
boy water when he was thirty. So I bought her
from him (she was better than the former one) and
cancelled the sale with the fir^ man. Afterwards this
Maghrabin too repented of having sold the servant
and wished to have the sale cancelled. He was very
insi^ent about it but I refused, simply to pay him
back for his vile conduct. He was like to go mad
or die of grief, but afterwards I cancelled his bargain
for him.

The copper mine is in the outskirts of Tagadda.
They dig the ore out of the ground, bring it to the
town, and ca^ it in their houses. This work is done
by their male and female slaves. When they obtain
the red copper, they make it into bars a span and a
half in length, some thin and others thick. The thick
bars are sold at the rate of four hundred for a mithqdl
of gold, and the thin at the rate of six or seven hundred
to the mithqdl. They serve also as their medium of
exchange; with the thin bars they buy meat and fire-
wood, with the thick, slaves, male and female, millet,
butter, and wheat. The copper is exported from
Tagadda to the town of Kiibar, in the regions of the
heathens, to Zaghay,®® and to the country of Barmi,
which is forty days’ journey from Tagadda. The
people of Barmi are Muslims, and have a king called
Idris, who never shows himself to his people nor talks
to them, except from behind a curtain.®"^ From this
country come excellent slave-girls, eunuchs, and fabrics
dyed with saffron. The copper from Tagadda is
carried also to Jawjawa, the country of the Muwar-
tabian, and elsewhere.®®

During my ^ay at Tagadda I wished to meet the
sultan, who is a Berber called Izar, and was then at
a place a day’s journey from the town. So I hired
a guide, and set out thither. He was informed of

336



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTOTA

my coming and came to see me, riding a horse without
a saddle, as is their custom. In place of a saddle he
had a gorgeous saddle-cloth, and he was wearing a
cloak, trousers, and turban, all in blue. With him
were his sixer’s sons, who arc the heirs to his kingdom.
We rose at his approach, and shook his hand, then he
asked about me and my arrival, and was told my
Aory. He had me lodged in one of the tents of the
Yandtibun, who arc like the wusfdn in our country,®
and he sent me a sheep roamed on a spit and a wooden
bowl of cows* milk. Near us was the tent of his
mother and his siAcr; they came to visit us and saluted
us, and his mother used to send us milk after the time
of evening-prayer, which is their milking time. They
drink it at that time and again in early morning, but
of cereal foods they neither eat nor know. I Aayed
with them six days, and every day received from the
sultan two roaAcd rams, one in the morning and one
in the evening. He also presented me with a she-
camel and with ten mitkqdu of gold, and I took leave
of him and returned to Tagaddd,

After my return to Tagaddd, a messenger arrived
with a command from our maAcr bidding me proceed
to his sublime capital. I kissed the order and con-
formed to its inAruilions. I bought two riding-
camels for thirty-seven and a third mithqdh and pre-
pared for the journey to Tawdt. I took with me
provisions for seventy days, for there is no corn to
be had between Tagaddd and Tawdt, only fleshmeat,
milk, and butter, which arc paid for with pieces of
cloth.

I left Tagaddd on Thursday nth Sha'ban of the
year [seven hundred and] fifty-four [nth September
1353] with a large caravan which included six hundred
women slaves. We came to Kdhir, where there are
abundant paAurages, and thence entered an unin-
habited and waterless desert, extending for three days^
337 z



SELECTIONS FROM THE

march.^° We journeyed next for fifteen days through
a desert which, though uninhabited, contains water-
points, and reached the place at which the Ghat road,
leading to Egypt, and the Tawdt road divide. Here
there are subterranean water-beds which flow over,
iron; if a piece of white cloth is washed in this water
it turns black.

Ten days after leaving this point we came to the
country of Haggar, who are a tribe of Berbers ; they
wear face veils and are a rascally lot.*^^ We en-
countered one of their chiefs, who held up the caravan
until they paid him an indemnity of pieces of cloth
and other goods. Our arrival in their country fell
in the month of Ramadan, during which they make
no raiding expeditions and do not moleif caravans.
Even their robbers, if they find goods on the road
during Ramadan, do not touch them. This is the
cu^om of all the Berbers along this route. We
continued to travel through the country of Haggar
for a month; it has few plants, is very ^tony, and the
road through it is bad. On the fe^ival of the Fa^t-
breaking we reached the country of some Berbers,
who wear the face-veils, like these others.

We came next to Bdda, one of the principal villages
of Tawat. The soil there is all sand and saltmarsh;
there are quantities of dates, but they are not good,
though the local inhabitants prefer them to the dates
of Sijilmasa. There are no crops there, nor butter,
nor olive oil ; all these things have to be imported from
the Maghrib. The food of its inhabitants consi^s of
dates and locu^s, for there are quantities of locu^s
in their country; they ^ore them ju^t like dates and
use them as food. They go out to catch the locu^s
before sunrise, for at that hour they cannot fly on
account of the cold.^

We ^ayed at Bdda for some days, and then joined
a caravan and in the middle of Dhu’l-qa‘da reached

338



TRAVELS OF IBN BATTUTA

the city of Sijilmdsa. I set out thence on the second
of Dhu'I-hijja [29th December], at a time of intense
cold, and snow fell very heavily on the way* I have
in my life seen bad roads and quantities of snow, at
Bukhird and Samarqand, in Khurdsdn, and the lands
of the Turks, but never have I seen anything worse
than the road of Umm Junayba. On the eve of the
Feilival we reached Dir at-Tama*. I i^ayed there
during the day of the fcail and then went on. So
I arrived at the royal city of Fa’s [Fez], the capital
of our madder the Commander of the Faithful (may
God Arcngthcn him), where I kissed his beneficent
hand and was privileged to behold his gracious coun-
tenance. [Here] I settled down under the wing of
his bounty after long journeying. May God Moil
High recompense him for the abundant favours and
ample benefits which he has bcAowed on me; may He
prolong his days and spare him to the Muslims for
many years to come.

Here ends the travel-narrative entitled A Donation

Ibn Juzayy adds: “Here ends the narrative which

*Abdallih Muhammad ibn Battfita (may God ennoble

this shaykh is the traveller of the age: and if one were

NOTES


Ibn Battuta’s estimate of three miles between the Pharos and
the city is an evident exaggeration, though Idrfsl also says that the
lighthouse was three miles distant by land and one mile by sea. A
later writer, al-Qalqashandf, puts the diilance at a mile. The same
author Elates that the Pharos was partially destroyed by the Greeks in
the early part of the eighth century, and fell gradually into decay
“ until in the middle of the fourteenth century it had become a total
ruin, only a fragment of it remaining.”

“ Pompey’s Pillar ” is a red granite column from Assuan, which
is supposed to have been erefted in late Roman times on the site of the
ancient temple of Serapis.

I.e. brother by spiritual affiliation, as the term usually signifies
in the language of the saints and mystics.

The phrase seems to be used here as a polite manner of depre-
cating the preference shovm by the shaykh to the traveller.

A species of muUet from which the Itah’an caviare {bottargo)
is obtained.

Ibn Battuta is in error here ; the city was deilroyed by the
Egyptian government after the Crusade of St. Louis in 1249-50,
to prevent its recapture by the Franks.

The rhetorical description in the text is an example (very much
abridged) of the florid ^le of composition in balanced and rhymed
sentences commonly found in such passages, and possibly intended to
convey the emotions of admiration and astonishment. It is not all
mere verbiage, however ; the laSl sentence is confirmed by the Itahan
Frescobaldi, who visited Cairo in 1384, and remarks that a hundred
thousand persons slept at night outside the city because of the shortage
of houses. This too after the ravages of the two “ Black Deaths ”
of 1348 and 1381.

Ar-Rawda, now the island of Roda. The amenities of Roda are
frequently mentioned in contemporary Arabic literature, and also
in the Arabian Nigbts,

■ Only the fa9ade, entrance hall (with minaret), and some frag-
ments of this magnificent hospital, built by Sultan QaM’iin (1279-90),
now remain. The sultan’s mausoleum, now partially restored, is one
of the mofl: exquisite monuments of medieval Saracenic architedhire
and ornament. Part of the ibreet ^till retains the name of “ Between
the two Cattles,” a name derived in aU probability from the Fitimid
palaces erefted in this quarter in the tenth and eleventh centuries.

The main Qardfa lies to the south of modern Cairo, between
Old Cairo and the Muqattam hills. In extent and in appearance it
resembles a town, owing to the peculiar Egyptian custom here referred ■
to of building chambers and houses over the tombs.

On the night following the 14th Sha'b^n (the eighth month of

like tanks, and great cooking-vessels.” In a later passage Ibn Battiita
refers to the legend that it was by the aid of the jinn that Solomon built
Palmyra {cf. i Kings ix. 1 8).

The mosque at Hebron is a Crusaders’ church built on much
older (probably pre-Roman) foundations, some of whose Clones fully
bear out Ibn Battuta’s statement. The cave is now blocked up, but
cenotaphs of the Patriarchs and their wives ^liU ^tand in small chapels
on either side of the nave. The (putative) tomb of Joseph is in a
separate exterior chapel. The tomb of Lot lies several miles to the ea^l.

The reference is to the miraculous •“ night-journey ” or “ ascen-
sion ” {mi'Tdj) in which Muhammad was given a vision of heaven.
Though living at the time in Mecca, he was, according to the tradition,
firft transported to “ the farthest mosque ” {al-masjid al-aqsa) in
Jerusalem, and thence ascended on the celeilial ^eed Buriq.

The present walls were built by the Ottoman sultan Sulayman
“ the Magnificent” (1520-1566).

The “ royal ” cubit measured about 26 inches.

This railing was ereded by the Franks during the Crusaders’
occupation of Jerusalem.

The mosque of the Ascension, on the brow of the Mount of
Olives, on the farther side of the Valley of Jehoshaphat, not the Valley
of Hinnom (Gehenna).

This seems to be a confusion between Jerusalem and Bethlehem,
where the crypt of the Church of the Nativity contains the shrine of
the Manger as well as the shrine of the Birthplace.

Aj^iin, now Qal‘at ar-Rabad, was a fortress in a conspicuous
position on the eastern ridge of the Ghawr (the Jordan valley), 1 2 miles
N.W. of Jerash.

Ibn Battuta has obviously confused the details of three separate
journeys in Syria — see below pp. 123 and 305.

A village close to Zahla, formerly reputed to possess the tomb
of Noah. Until the middle of the fourteenth century the floor of the
Biqd‘ (Coele-Syria) was covered by a lake or marsh at this point, and
there was a tradition that the Ark came to reft on the spur of Anjar
on the opposite side to and S.E. of Zahla.

Tripoli was recovered by Sultan ^ald’un in 1289.

A similar ftory is told of Muhammad the Daftarddr during the
Turko-Egyptian campaign in KordoHn in 1821. A complaint was
preferred by a woman againft a soldier, and the commander had the
man cut open alive “ on the woman agreeing to suffer the same fate if
the milk was not found in the man’s ftomach ” {Journal of the African
Soc., No. 98, Jan. 1926, p. 170).

The “Ten” were the moft prominent members of Muhammad’s

The founder of the Umayyad dynasty of Caliphs, which reigned
at Damascus from 660 to 749, and was supplanted by the ‘Abbdsid
dynafty, who made their capital at Baghdad. The bazaar of the
coppersmiths ^Hll occupies the same position, but is by no means “ one
of the fineft in Damascus ” at the present day.

This was originally a mechanical water-clock, which was ilill
in working order when Ibn Jubayr visited Damascus in 1184 (see
le Strange, Palefline under the Moslems^ p. 250), but had fallen
out of repair in the interval. Though the galleries have long since
disappeared, the spouting fountain (a relic of Byzantine days) still
exists.

As being contrary to the orthodox do&ine that no activity or
quality in God is to be compared with the corresponding human
activity or quality. The Hanbalite scliool, the most conservative of
the four orthodox schools (see In trod., p. 23), disallowed the rationaliz-
ing interpretations of the other schools.

The wearing of silk is contrary to ilri£t Muhammadan law.

On Ibn Taynuya, who died in 1328, see Introd., p. 38. His
name is now held in great respect as the forerunner of the Wahhabi
and other modem reform movements in Islam.

A Muhammadan fail is limited to the hours of daylight, but
is absolute during that time, even water-drinking being proHbited.

It is probably this chara£leriiHc that has earned for Damascus
the nickname of al-matbakh, “ the kitchen.”

Baldah is identified by Musil {Northern Hejaz, p. 329) with the
valley of al-Bazw 4 , about fifty kilometres south of Dhit al-Hajj and
near the Elation of al-Hazm at 28.41 N., 36.14 E.

63 “'Pile halting-place of al-Ukhaydir (al-Akhzar) lies in a deep
valley enclosed by high slopes, in places covered with lava. Ibn
Battuta rightly compares this to a valley of hell ” (Musil, ih. 329).
Al-Akhzar, the name of which (“ The little green place ”) is obviously
ironical, is situated at 28.08 N., 37.01 E.

The ^lory of the impious tribe of Thamud, who were annihilated
for their disobedience, is frequently related in the Koran. It arose
in all probability from the exigence of these tombs, which belonged to
an early South-Arabian trading community settled on the trade-route
between the Yemen and the marts of Syria, and afterwards confused
with the ancient North-Arabian tribe of Thamud.

Nation of Jubfa was situated 103 (Arabic) miles from^whi’, which

available in English in addiuon to this, that it is unnecessary to repeat
all these details here.


CHAPTER II

^ The pilgrim road from Bagbdid and Najaf to Madina is known
as the Darh Zuhajia, after the wife of Caliph Hirtin ar*Rashld, who
built reservoirs aU along the route and provided endowments from
her property for their upkeep. The route, consequently, has scarcely
changed for twelve hundred years. According to Hamdinf, the
nations from Madina to Fayd were: Taraf (24 Arabic miles), Batn
Nakhl (20 m.), 'Usayla (28 m.), Ma'dia an*Naqira (26 m.), al-Hijir
(28 m.), Sanxlri (23 m.), T6z (25 m.), Fayd (24 m.) : total, 196
Arabic miles or 234 English miles. Ibn Battuta, evidently travelling
by half'Hages, takes six days to reach 'Usayla (I cannot find his Widi’l-
'Anis), then takes the alternative road through Naqira inHead of Ma'din
an-Naqira, rejoins the main route at Qlriira (between Ma'din an-
Naqira and al-Hijir, and 12 miles from the latter), and thence follows
it without variation. Al-Makhniqa — the perforated hill — is shown on
Musil's I ; 1,000,000 map 27 English miles S.W.ofFayd.at 26.50 N.,
41.36 E., and Fayd itself at 27.08 N., 41.53 E.

’ Yiqfit adds that a portion of the provisions and heavy baggage is
given in remuneradon to the parries in whose care they are left.

NOTES

^ The various Plages on the journey between Fayd and Kufa,
totalling 277 Arabic miles or 330 English miles, need not be detailed
here. “ Devil’s Pass ” is probably the pass marked ash-She eb on
Musil’s map, at. 30.11 N., 4342 E. W^qisa is shown at 30.38 N.,
43.51 E., Lawza’lies 16 Engh'sh miles N. by E. of W^qisa, al-Masijid
or al-Musayjid 56 m. S. by W. of Najaf, Man^rat al-Qurun appears
as Ummu Qurun, a sanduary 30 m. S. by W. of Najaf. Qddisiya is
fifteen miles due south of Najaf. The battle to which Ibn Battuta
refers was fought in 637, five years after Muhammad’s death, and
resulted in the complete rout of the Persian army and the occupation
of ‘Ir£q by the Arabs.

* The son-in-law of the Prophet, and fourth Caliph, assassinated

the nephew of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qidir al-Jilinl, and founder of the
Rifd‘iya order of darw/shes, a sub-group of the Qidiriya. order, and one
of the principal orders in Egypt at the present day. The name of
Ahmad! darwishes, which Ibn Battuta gives to the order, is now usually
given to the sub-group founded by Shaykh Ahmad al-Badawf, who was
a disciple of the convent of Umm ‘Ubayda and died at Tanta in Egypt,
in 1276.

The apparent shrinkage of Basra was due not entirely to decay,
but to a gradual eastward shifting of the city : c/. note 10.

® The ftujra was an Egyptian silver coin worth about fivepence ;
see Chap. XII, note 18.

® Ibn Battuta’s audience would aU, of course, be familiar with the
faft that it was at Basra that the rules of Arabic grammar were systema-
tized in the second century after Muhammad, the “ leader ” referred
to below being Sibawayh, the author of the firSt large systematic
grammar of Arabic.

the minor dynaSties which established themselves after the break-up
of the Saljuq empire in the twelfth century.

Between 836 and 883 Simarrd was the seat of the Caliphs, and
was adorned by them with many magnificent palaces and public build-
ings, of which veib'ges ^lill remain. The fort of Ma'shuq probably
occupied the site of the palace of the same name {al-ma’shuq means
“ the Beloved ”) erefted by the Caliph Mu‘tamid (reigned 870-892).

The word qaysarlya is defined variously as “ a public place in
which the market is held ” or “ a square building containing chambers,
^orerooms, and flails for merchants.” The name is evidently derived
from the Latin or Greek, and was used orginally only by the Arabs of
Syria and North Africa, but its origin is obscure. Of various theories
which have been advanced the mo^l probable is that it means a market
building, privileged or authorized by the ruler (originally in these
countries, of course, the Csesar) in return for a certain fixed payment,
but no corresponding term has been found in the Byzantine histories.
It is now applied to the principal market of a town, and I have heard
the term used in North Africa (Tlemsen) for the main shopping ^Ireet.
The provision of gates for bazaars was, and ildll is, quite common.
(Dozy s,v. ; le Strange, of the EaSlem Caliphate, p. 89).

Sinjar is evidently misplaced. It is moil probable that it was
visited on the way back from M^rfdin to Mosul.

Dixi, “ the rampart of the Roman Empire,” was built by Juilinian

The fortress of Maridin was assigned in 1108 by the Saljuq
ruler of Baghdad to Il-Ghdz{ “ one of the moil redoubtable of Muslim
warriors againil the Crusaders ” (Lane-Poole), whose descendants,
known as the Ortuqids of Miridfn, retained possession of the city and

left for the present ruler of Najd, Sultan ‘Abd al-‘Azfz Al-Sa‘iid, to
perform it in an automobile.

CHAPTER IV^

^ Bildd ar-Rtim, literally “ the land of the Greeks,” though used
of the Byzantine territories generally, was naturally applied more
specially to the frontier province of Anatolia. After some temporary
conquers in earlier centuries, it had been finally overrun by the Saljuq
Turks between 1071 and 1081. Down to the end of the thirteenth
century, the whole peninsula, except those se6lions which were held
by the Christians (Byzantium, Trebizond, and Armenia) or the ruler
of ‘Irdq, owed allegiance to the Saljuq sultan of Konia, but from a
little before 1 300 it was parcelled out between a score of local chiefs,
whose territories were gradually absorbed into the Ottoman Empire.

^ The port of ‘Alayi was constructed by one of the greateSt of the
Saljuq sultans of Rum, ‘AH ad-Dln Kay-(^ubad I (1219-37), and was
renamed after him. To the WeStern merchants it was known as
Candelor (from its Byzantine name kalon oros). Egypt, being notori-
ously deficient in wood, has always needed to import large quantities
of it for the building of fleets, etc.

® Adaliya, known to the WeStern merchants as Satalia, was the
moSt important trading Station on the south coaSt of Anatolia, the
Egyptian and Cypriote trade being the moSt aCtive. The .lemon is
Still called Adaliya in Egypt.

^ The closing of the city gates and exclusion of Christians at night
and during the hours of the Friday service was observed until quite
recently in a number of places on the Mediterranean seaboard, such as
Sfax, probably as a measure of precaution againSt surprise attacks.

^ The history of the organizations called by the name of Futuwa is
Still obscure. They appear firSt in the twelfth century in several
divergent forms, which can probably all be traced to the Sufis, or
darwlsh orders. The word futuwa, “ manliness,” had long been
applied amongSt the latter in a moral sense, defined as “ to abstain from

ceremony of admission into one such band at Baghdid in the middle
of the tvv elfth century that trousers are firA mentioned as the symbohe

should call for assiflance m any misfortune that might befall him,
cledcd suitable persons and similarly inveAccl them with trousers on

In 1 1 82 the Cahph an Nisir, having been mve^ed with the Itids
or trousers by a Sufi shaykb, conceived the idea of organizing the
Fututca on the hnes of an order of Chivalry (probably on the Frankish
model), conAituted himself soveragn of the order, and bellowed the
libit as Its insigma on the ruling princes and other personages of Kis
time The ceremony of milallation included the solemn putting on
of the trousers and drinking from the * cup of manhood ” {ka*s aA
/tttuaa), which contained not wine, but salt and water The order
took over from its Sdfl progenitors a liditious genealogy back to the
Cahph *Ali (see Chap II, note 4), and continued to eziA for some
time after the reign of Nisir m a languishing ^te The Brotherhood
which Ibn Battuta found in Koma, and which was difbnguished from

Its claim to spiritual descent from *A 1 /, was probably a rehc of the order
founded by the romantic Cahph The remaining Anatohan organiza
tions seem to have been local trade guilds with a very ^ong infusion
of Suhsm, oddly combined with a pohtical tendency towards local
self government and the keeping in check of the tyranny of the Turkish
sultans (See generally Thorning, Turkmhe Bibliotbekt Band XVI

Shams! Tabriz (the sweetmeat-seller of Ibn Battuta’s ^lory). Jalil
ad-DIn, who died at Konia in 1273, is generally held to be the greatest
of the Persian mystical poets. (See R. A. Nicholson, Selcded Poems
from the Divdni Shamsi Tabriz, Introduction.)

BirgI is the ancient Pyrgion, in the /alley of the Cay^ler. There
is an obvious gap in Ibn Battuta’s narrative at this point, since he can
hardly have crossed the entire breadth of Anatolia without touching
some town or another, even if he went by the direft road from Sivas
through the central plateau. It is more likely that he retraced his
route to some extent towards Konia and thence through Egerdir.

This refers to the capture of Smyrna in 1344 (many years after
Ibn Battuta’s visit) by a crusading force, with the assiitance of the
Knights of St. John.

Fiija (Fuggia, the ancient Phocaea), which had been ceded by
the Palaelogi to the Genoese family of Zaccaria, was an important
trading Elation, the Zaccaria family having sole control of the alum-
mines there and of the ma^Hc trade of Chios (which they had seized in
1304). It is not quite certain whether the Fiija of this period was
Old Phocaea (Eski Foja) or New Phocasa (Yeni Foja).

Ibn Battuta’s account is one of the few firsthand accounts we
possess of the early days of the Ottoman Empire. Brusa is said to
have surrendered to the Turks in 1326, the year of ‘Othmdn’s d^th,
and Niesa fell in 1329, but hostilities againSl both cities had begun
very much earlier (see H. A. Gibbons, Foundations of the Ottoman
Empire, 46-8). With regard to the name ‘Othmin Chiik, given to
‘Othmin, Prof. Kramers has suggested that it was derived not direftly
from the Arabic name ‘Othmin, but from the fortress of Osmanjik
on the Kizil Armak {Z.DM.G,, 81, LXII f.).

I prefer this, the reading of the beSt MS. to the reading “ We
treated her kindly,” which is adopted in the text.

Burlu is identified by Defr^mery with Boyalu, S.W. of KaStamuni.

More commonly called Solghdt, now Stary-Krim, in the interior
of the Crimea. At this time it was the residence of the Mongol governor
of the Crimea, and later on the seat of an independent K^nate.

The Khanate of Qipchaq or the Golden Horde was the weSlern-
moSl of the four great Mongol Khanates established in the thirteenth
century, and was itself at this time divided into the Blue Horde and
the White Horde. Though the latter held a . titular suzerainty, the
Blue Horde, whose appanage was on the Don and Volga, was aiElually
the more powerful, and their territories extended from Kiev and the
Caucasus to the Aral Sea and Khiva. Sultan Muhammad tjzbeg,
who reigned from 1312 to 1340, was one of the greateSl of the Khans
of the Blue Horde.

Caffa, now Feodosia, was rebuilt by the Genoese towards the
end of the thirteenth century as their principal trading station on the
northern coaSl of the Black Sea.

^ Bulghir, the ruins of which lie on the left bank of the Volga
juft below the junftion of the Kama, was the capital of the medixval
kingdom of Great Bulgaria, annexed by the Mongols in the thirteenth
century. It possessed great commercial importance as the diftributing
cen^e for Russian and Siberian produfts. It is difficult to underftand,
however, how Ibn Battfita could have made the journey from Mijar
to Bulgh^, some 800 miles, in ten days 1

^ This term apparently designates Northern Siberia t see Yule’s
Marc 9 Polo^, II, 484-fi.

It has been pointed out in a note to Yule’s Marco Polo (II, 488)
that this Ukak is not the well-known town of that name frequently
mentfoned by the medixval writers, which was situated on the Volga
about six miles below Saratov, but a small place mentioned in the
portolans as Locachi or Locaq, on the Sea of Azof. The silver mines
of which Ibn Battdta speaks are” ceiuiin mines of argentiferous lead-ore
near the river Miuss (a river falling into the ^ of Azof, about
22 miles weftof Taganrog). . , . It was these mines wluch furnished
the ancient Russian rubles or ingots.”

^ Surdiq or Soldaia, now Sudak, in the Crimea, was until the rise
' of Cafia (see note 18) the principal trading port on the northern coaft
of the Euiinc. It is not clear why the parly should have made a detour
through the Crimea ; possibly Ibn Battuta has confused the details of
the route, and visited Surdiq during his ftay at Stary Krim.

” There seems to be no clue to the position of ^s sanfhsary, but
from Ibn Battfita’s descriptioa it was somewhere between the Dni^pr
and the Crimea. It has been suggefted that from this Bibi Saltfiq
(transported to Baba Dagh in Moldavia in 1389) arose the cult of
Sari Saltik associated with the Bektashi order (see F. W. Hasluck,
Jnn. Brit. SeA. Athens XIX, 203-6 ; XX, 107, note i).

Ibn Battuta’s route throu^ Thrace to Conftantinople is totally

unrecognizable from his account of it. Here, as again in China, the
unfamiliarity of the names has led to sTirange perversions, especially
when reproduced from memory after a lapse of twenty years. The
frontier city of the Empire in 133 1-2 (the date which muft be assigned
to this journey in spite of Ibn Battuta’s chronology) was Diampolis,
otherwise Kavuli (now Jamboli), for which “ MahtuH ” may perhaps
pass. The “canal” is evidently a tidal river or eiluary, and one
naturally thinks of the Danube, though this involves a serious mis-
placing. But Fanfka is probably Agathonlk^, where the main road
from Diampolis crossed the Tunja (Tontzos) river, at or near Kizil
Agach. The “ Fortress of Maslama ibn ‘Abd al-Malik ” belongs to
the legendary accretions to the history of the Arab expedition againft
Constantinople in 716-7, of which Maslama was the commader-in-chief.

Kifdli is a transliteration of the Greek kephale, head, chief.

The Emperor at this time was Andronicus III, grandson of
Andronicus II. The title Takfur (from Armenian tagavor=d^ king ”)
was applied by the Muhammadan writers to the Emperor and the
other Christian kings in Asia Minor, probably as a riming jingle
with the title given to the Emperor of China, Fagkfur (for Bagh-pur,
the Persian translation of the Chinese title “ Son of Heaven ”). There
is some difficulty in explaining how Ibn Battiita came to call the retired
Emperor Andronicus II (who had abdicated in 1328, become a monk,
and died on February 1 3, 1 332) by the name of George.

The ceremonial here described is in accordance with the practice
of the Byzantine court, afterwards adopted by the Ottoman sultans
when they captured Constantinople.

The Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified but carried up
to Heaven, and that a figure resembling him was crucified in his Stead.

The number of monks and churches in Constantinople seems to
have Struck moSt travellers at this time. Bertrandon de la Bloquiere,
who spent the winter of 1432-3 there, estimates the number of
churches at 3,000, and implies that the greater number of the inhabi-
tants lived in monasteries. See also Clavijo, p. 88.

There were two cities of “ Sarray in the land of Tartarye,” which *
were successively the capital of the Khans of the Golden Horde ;
Old Sarai, situated near the modern village of Selitrennoe, 74 miles
above Astrakhan, and New Sarai, which embraced the modem town of
Tsarev, 225 miles above Astrakhan. Sultan Muhammad Uzbeg
moved the capital from Old Sarai to New Sarai about this period, moSl
probably a few^ years before. Ibn Battuta’s description agrees beSl
with New Sarai, the ruins of which extend over a distance of more
foan forty rniles, and cover an area of over twenty square miles. (See

Jdm. The province of Khurdsdn, which Ibn Battuta had now entered,
was at this time ^11 under the rule of the Mongol sultan of Persia and
‘Ir^q, at leail nominally.

The name of Mashhad means literally Mausoleum of ar-Ridd,
ar-Ridd being the tide by which the Imdms of the Shi‘ites are known.
The Imdm buried here is the eighth of the line, ‘AH ibn Musd, who

which these towns are mentioned seems to be thoroughly confused, and
Sarakhs in particular should come either between Jdm and Tds, or
else on the return journey from Bidldm.

Bistdm lies S.E. of Adterabad, at the S.E. angle of the Caspian

Sea.

Here again there is a gap in the narrative, since from the Caspian
Ibn BattiSta leaps across to northern Afghanistan, where Qundiiz lies
on the river of the same name, and Baghldn on the same river some way
to the south. The eadtem half of Afghanidlan as far south as Ghazna
was at this time subject to the Jaghatdy-Khdns.

Ibn Battuta followed the route across the Khdwak Pass (13,000
feet high), N.E. of Kdbul.

Mahmud of Ghazna, who reigned from 998 to 1030, paved the
way for the establishment of Muhammadan rule in Nor^em India
by his merciless raids into Sind, Pan jab, and the neighbouring provinces.

It is impossible to determine, on the basis of this description, the
aftual route by which Ibn Battuta entered India. The tale about the

together would point to the Khyber Pass. On the other hand the
mention of a desert extending for fifteen days, together vwth Ibn
Battuta’s visit to Ghazna (erroneously inserted before Kdbul) indicates
some more obscure route through the Sulayman mountains, leading
out to the lower course of the Indus.

and as Ibn Battdta reached the Indus in September there would appear
to be a gap of some nine months m the narrative It u more probable,
however, that his chronology is slightly out, or else that the party
ezpenenced an unusual spell of heat.

NOTES

The ruins of Mas‘uddbid lie a mile eail of Najafgarh, and six
miles W. by N. of Palem Clarion.

The ruins of medieval Delhi lie some ten miles south of the
present city, Delhi proper, Jahdn Pandh, and Sir! in a continuous line
N.E. from Mahrauh, Tughlaqdbdd four miles eail of Delhi proper and
two miles eaft of modern Tuglakabad. This group of towns never
recovered from the loss inflicted on it by Sultan Muhammad, as related
below by Ibn Battuta, and again suffered severely from Tfmur (Tamer-
lane) in 1398. New Delhi was the creation of the Mogul sultan
Shdh Jahdn (1627-58).

Some account of the early Muhammadan sultans of Delhi will be
found in the Introdu£Hon, pp. 22-24.

Here, as also in his description of the Kutub Mindr and ‘Ald’f
Mindr below, Ibn Battuta’s figures are exaggerated. The iron pillar
of Chandragupta, which was brought from Muttra and set up at Delhi
by its Hindu founder in the eleventh century, is 1 6 inches in diameter
and 23 feet in height. The Kutub Mindr is 238 feet high, the
unfinished portion of the ‘Ald’f Minar (wrongly attributed by Ibn
Battuta to Qutb ad-Dfn) 70 feet high, and neither is so wide as he
represents it to be.

The charader of Sultan Muhammad ibn Tughlaq portrayed in
this passage is frrifHy hifrorical ; see Introdu£Hon, p. 23.

Dawlatdbdd or Deogiri lies in the N.W. corner of the frate of
Hyderabad (Deccan). Sultan Muhammad decided to make it his
capital, in view of its importance as a base for military operations in
Southern India, and twice (or thrice) attempted to remove thither the
whole population of Delhi. By the irony of fortune, however, it was
captured during his lifetime by the founder of the Muhammadan
Bahmanf dynadty of the Deccan. See also Chap. VII, note 7.

In a previous se£Hon, omitted in this edition, Ibn Battuta relates
at length the hifrory of Shaykh Shihdb ad-Dfn. He had incurred the
sultan’s displeasure firdl by refusing to take office under him, and spent
some years in an underground dwelling he dug for himself near Delhi,
and which contained several rooms, frore-rooms, an oven and a bath.
On being summoned again to the court he openly branded Muhammad
Shdh as a traitor, and when he refused to retraft his fratement, was
executed.


CHAPTER VII

^ Yule has suggested that this is Sambhal in Rohilkhand, some
eighty miles eafr of Delhi {Cathay y IV, 18).

JaM is a small place 1 1 miles S.E. of Aligarh. The fa<ft that
the country within a hundred miles of Delhi was in so difrurbed a frate
throws a curious light on the nature of Sultan Muhammad’s “ empire.”

come into general use until the sixteenth century. It was captured by
the Muhammadans for the firft time in 1312, and was subsequently
taken and retaken more than once.

The sites of these medieval ports, many of which no longer exifl,
are discussed by Yule, Cathay y IV, 72-79;

The name of this kingdom, Ili or Eli, has left a trace in Mount
Delly. The medieval port is probably now represented by the village
of Nileshwar, a few miles north of the promontory.

Calicut, which Ibn Battuta has already ranked (p. 46), as one
of the great seaports of the world, decayed rapidly after the eilablish-
ment of the Portuguese trading stations in the sixteenth century. The
title of its ruler, c^ed by Ibn Batt6ta the Sdmarf (which is an adapta-
tion to Muslim ears of a foreign name, Simari being a word familiar
to theologians as the legendary anceitor of the Samaritans), is the
Malayalam word Sdmtitiri or Bimuri meaning “ Sea-king,” more
familiar to European readers in its Portuguese form Zamorin.

The purpose of these was to tow the junk in calm weather, as
Ibn Battiita explains below (p. 278).

Although a considerable part of the distance between Calicut
and Quilon may be traversed by inland waterways, it does not seem
possible to go the whole way by water. Ibn Batttita here, as again in
the description of his travels in China, neglefts the land Plages.

Quilon, ranked by Ibn Batttita with Calicut, was from very early
times the transhipment port for the Chinese trade. It is mentioned
by the Arab and Persian sailors of the ninth century under the name of
Kawlam-Malay, and fell* into decay, like its rival Calicut, in the
sixteenth century. Yule suggests that the title Tirazvarl given by Ibn
Battiita to its ruler may be the Tamil-Sanskrit compound Tiru-pati
“ Holy Lord ” {Cathay, IV, 40).

kinds, and the name shall is ^tiU used for a soft cotton fabric. It is
possible that the name of this town is the origin of the French chale,
and hence our shawl.


CHAPTER VIII

^ Although the Maidive Islands had long been knovm to sailors
and travellers, and had become Islamized in the twelfth centujy, Ibn
Battuta’s narrative is the earliedl descriptive account we possess of the
islands and their inhabitants. Many of his names can ftill be traced
on the map.

NOTES

* The “ mountain of Sercndfb” is Adam’s Peak. Screndlb is the
old Arabic and Persian name of Ceylon (commonly derived from the
Sanskrit Bimhala^dvipct Lidn*dwelling~island)> which was gradually
replaced by the Pali form Sihalam=Saylan=(^ylon.

* The old Sinhalese kingdom of Ceylon was invaded about 1314
by the Pandyas, whose own kingdom at Madura in Ma'bar, which had
eii^d since at IcaA the third century s.c.» was now in the hands of
the Muhammadans. The leader of the invaders was Arya Chakra*
varti, but Ibn Battuta’s patron was more probably a later general of
the same name, who in 1371 creSlcd forts at Colombo and elsewhere.
The seat of the Pandyas was in the island of Jadha.

‘ The hollow on the summit of Adam’s Peak, venerated by the
Muslims as the imprint of Adam’s foot, was equally venerated by the
Brahmans and the BuddhBb, as the mark of Siva’s and Buddha’s foot

1587), near Dondra Head, the southermoA j^iot of Ceylon.

CHAPTER IX'

' Harkdtu cannot be the modem town of Arcot, which lies too far
north. As it was only a fort its location is very doubtful, though the
name is probably connefied with the diArid of Arcot (Tamil aru^kadu,
six foreAs).

* Jalil ad-Dfn, who had been appointed by Sultan Muhammad of
Delhi to the poA of mili tary governor of Ma'bar (which had been
occupied by the Muhammadans in 1311), made himself independent
about 1338, and was murdered five years later. The throne was then
occupied by a succession of generals, of whom Ghiyith ad-Dfn was
the third.

® Of the man y -fatans and -palams of the Coromandel coaA, it
is difficult to determine exaAIy the original of this Fattan. The
principal port of medieval Ma'bar was Kaveripattanam, at one of the

be dated nearer 1350 (see Marco Polo^ II, 335 "^)* Fattan may,
however, have been Negapatam, which was an important harbour in
after centuries. Yule’s conje6hire that the place mu^l be farther south,
in the neighbourhood of Ramnad, is unlikely if the name Hark^tu has
anything to do with Arcot (see note i). At some time during his visit
to Ma'bar, on the other hand, or else on his journey from Fattan to
Kawlam, Ibn Battuta mu^ have called at the small port of Kaylukan',
10 miles S. of Ramnad, which he afterwards transported to somewhere
in the China Sea (see Chap. X, note 9). It is Grange that Ibn Battiita
does not mention the port of K^yal, Marco Polo’s Call, situated in the
delta of the Tamraparni river, south of Tuticorin, which was a very
important trading Elation at this time (see Marco Polo, II, 370-4).

* This is identified, following Yule, with the Pigeon Island, 35 miles
south of Onore (Hinawr).

® This ^latement is impossible to reconcile with any chronology
of Ibn Battuta’s travels in the Far Eail. Judging by the course of the
narrative, this second visit cannot have been made later than a year
after his departure from the Maidive Islands.

® Sudkdwdn is identified by some authorities with Satgaon (Satganw),
a ruined town on the Hooghly lying N.W. of Hooghly town, which
was the mercantile capital of Bengal from the days of Hindu rule
until the foundation of Hooghly by the Portuguese. Yule, with more
probability, identified it with Chittagong (Chatganw), which was
a more convenient port than Satgaon, and is “ on the shores of the
Great Sea,” as described by Ibn Battuta. There seems, however, to
be some uncertainty whether Sultan Fakhr ad-Din had any connection
with Chittagong (Jf. Book of Duarte Barbosa, II, 139).

" Jun, which is Ibn Battuta’s transcription for the Jumna, here
obviously represents the Brahmaputra {cf. p. 52).

® Lakhnaoti (Lakshmanawati), the ancient name of the town of
Gawr, long the capital of the Muhammadan governors of Bengal
after its conquest in 1 204, the ruins of which are situated near Maldah.
The name was retained for one of the three diilriCts of Bengal (see
note ri), covering the area between the Ganges and the Brahmaputra.

^ It has been fully established by Yule {Cathay, IV, i5i-5)> that
the diSlriCt visited by Ibn Battuta was Sylhet, where the tomb of Shah
Jelal (=Shaykh JaJil ad-Dfn) is Still venerated. The name Kdmrii,
more correftly Kdmrub (for Kdmarupa), was applied to the diStriCi
roughly corresponding to Assam, whose Indo-Chinese population
(Khasis, etc.) present the usual Mongolian characteristics.

The Blue River can only be the Meghna, and on the left bank of
the Barak, one of its headwaters, there is Still a tillah, or low hill, called
Habang, a little to the south of Habiganj.

“ Sonargaon (Sunarganw), 15 miles S.E. of Dacca, was one of the
old Muhammadan capitals of Bengal, and gave its name to one of the
three districts of Bengal, the third being Satganw.

contemporary writers under varying names the pitchy sea, the sea
of darkness) as lying in the extreme ea^. It seems therefore to corres-
pond to our China Sea or some of the neighbouring waters. The
following words in Ibn Battuta’s narrative show that it was on the
regular route.

® The problem of identifying the king Tawdlisi -and his city of
Kayliikarl is one that has exercised the ingenuity of all Ibn Battuta’s
commentators. Celebes, Tonkin, Cambodia, Cochin-China, the
province of Kwan-si, the Philippine Islands, and the Sulu Archipelago
have all been suggested. Y ule accepts the la^l solution as more probable
than any other, but only after confessing to “ a faint suspicion . . .
that Tawdlisf is reaUy to be looked for in that part of the atlas which
contains the marine surveys of the late Captain Gulliver.” The moil
surprising detail in the narrative is not the existence of the princess of
amazonian charafteriilics, but her Turkish name (already given by
Ibn Battuta as the name of Sultan Uzbeg-Khdn’s fourth queen, see
above p. 148) and Turkish speech. Yule, followed by Dr. von Mzik,
suggests that the details of her prowess may be derived from the ^lory
of Kaydu-Kh^’s valiant daughter Aijaruc, which Ibn Battiita may
have heard from some of the ship’s folL Aijaruc is in faft a Turkish
name, and it is quite probable that Ibn Battuta, whose memory, for
Grange names was not of the be^, confused it with the similar-sounding
Urduj^. In the same way KayMkarf was really the name of a seaport
in S.E. India (see Chap. IX, note 3), which Ibn Battiita has confused
with the name of king “ Taydlisi’s ” port {Cathay^ IV, 157-60 ; Marco
Palo, II, 465 ; G. Ferrand, Textes relatifs d P Extrime-Orient, 43 r-3).

CHAPTER XI

^ The description of this great river, traversing China from north
to south and flowing into the sea at Canton, has sometimes been taken
to prove that Ibn Battuta’s journey to China, or at leafl: in China, is
a pure fidtion. It muil, however, be borne in mind that he knew no
more of China than the fringe which he himself visited, supplemented
by what he could gather from various (and doubtless not always reliable)
informants, and in this passage he is merely reproducing the common
view of his time. The “ River of Life ” is, in its firfl: sedtion, the
Grand Canal, between Peking and the Yang-tsi. The merchants
on the coafl: knew vaguely of the inland water system connedling
Hang-chow and the Yang-tsi with the Weft River and Canton, prob-
ably by way of the Siang-kiang, and consequently regarded the eftuary
of the Pei-kiang as that of the entire syftem. There is greater difficulty
in explaining Ibn Battuta’s ftatements that Zaytun (Ts’wan-chow-fu)
was linked by inland waterways with both Canton and Hang-chow,
where presumably he was speaking from personal experience. As



NOTES

wc luve seen above, however, in connedion with his knd journey
between Ciliciit and Quilon (Chap. VII, note 17), Ibn Battfita simply
omits all reference to the land dages as secondary, or he may possibly
have forgotten about them in the ten years that intervened between
his visit to China and the dldadon of his travels. It is not irrelevant
to note that other writers, including even some Chinese sources, also
spealc of Zayt6n as being on the same water sydem as Hang-chow
(Khansi or Quinsay). (See in addition to Yule and von M2ik,
R. Hartmann in Der hlem^ IV, 434.)

* Friar Odoric of Pordenone also remarks, in connedion with

Fuchow, “ Here be seen the bigged cocks in the woild ” ; but he says
of the geese at Canton that they are “ bigger and finer and cheaper
than anywhere in the world ” II, 181, 185).

* duManhand arahe Sula^man . . . <n
85 1, tr. G. Ferrand, p. 5 5) tells us that the Chinese buried their dead,
as they do at the present day. Marco Polo, however, condantly
refers to the pradice of cremation, which mud therefore have been
a common cuAom in China at this period.

* The hiUsht or bilUht originally an ingot of metal weighing
about 4 J lbs., was the currency of the deppes at the beginning of the
thirteenth century. The term was probably brought into China
by the Mongols. On Chinese paper-money see Marto Pe/e, 3 , 423^.

* According to Marco Polo, the owner of used notes paid three
per cent, on the value on receiving new pieces (1, 42 5).

® Cathay a term employed fird by the Muhammadans

and from them by European travellers and missionaries from the
lUrtcenth to the sixteenth centuries, denoted the northern part of
China, in conlrad to Sin or China proper in the south. The name was
certainly derived from the Kitiy or Khiliy Turks, who founded a
dynady (the Liao) which reigned at Peking during the tenth and
eleventh .centuries. The name Sfn or Chfn (China) is, in all prob-
ability, to be derived similarly from the Tiin dynady (255-209 b.c.).

In this passage Ibn Baltiita obviously confuses coal and porcelain
clay, possibly owing to a cudom followed in China of powdering the
coal and mixing it with clay to form ” patent fuel ” (see Marco Polo,
1,442-3).

® It is generally admitted that the city known to all Muham-
madan and Chridian travellers in the Middle Ages as Zayiijn is Ts’wan-
chow-fu (ChQan-chow-fu, 24.53 N., 118.33 E.). The arguments
in favour of this identification, togciher'with an examination of the
claims of Chang-chow-fu (Amoy), will be found in extenso in Marco
Polo, II, 237^. , .

from zayttini through medieval Italian zettani {Cathay, IV, 1 18).

NOTES

I take the diwdn mentioned in this passage to be, not the
“ Council ” (whatever organization that may have been), but the
institution commonly known by that name in North Africa and Egypt
in all ports open to foreign commerce, from which originated the
Italian dogane and French douane. It was at one and the same time
cuStom-house, warehouse, lodging house and bourse for foreign
merchants (for which reason Ibn Battuta is lodged in it), and its con-
troller was one of the principal officers of the realm (see Mas Latrie,
Relations et Commerce de RJfrique Septentrionale, Z'iSff')' ^ similar
organization appears to be indicated in the Chinese ports. A few
lines below Ibn Battuta says of Canton that it was “ in the province ”
of the controller of the diwdn, probably in the sense that the trading
Station there was also under his jurisdiftion.

The sense of this passage is quite clear. According to the Koran,
the legal alms are to be given to “ parents, kindred, orphans, the poor,
and the wayfarer.” The Muhammadan community at Zaytiin was
so wealthy that the only one of these five classes to which the alms were
of any value was the laSl.

The Arabic and Persian writers (like Marco Polo) conventionally
use the term Q^dn or Qa’dn for the “ Great Khan ” of the Mongols.
It is not, however, as Yule considered, a different title from the ordinary
Turkish title Khdqdn (see Shiratori, Memoirs of Research Dept, of the
Toyo Bunko, No. i, Tokyo, 1926, pp. 19-26).

Sfn-kaldn is an Arabicized form of the Persian Chm-kaMn, for
Sanscrit Mahdc{na= Great China, which is also the meaning of the
Arabic name Sfn as-Sfn.

The text is defective at this point, due either to the miswriting
of a word, or to the omission of another word.

Ibn Battuta’s route “ up the river ” from Ts’wan-chow to Canton
is, in the nature of things, uncertain. Yule thinks of a route up the
Min from Foochow, and down the upper reaches of the Kan to the
Pei-kiang via the Mei-ling Pass. It seems a peculiarly roundabout
journey, when much more direft communication is offered by the
Mei and the Tung, if these are navigable.

This temple has not been identified with any certainty. Yule
suggeffs that it is the Temple of Glory and Filial Duty, near the N.W.
corner of the modern city.

The site of the Rampart of Gog and Magog, the building of
which is described in the Koran and attributed to Alexander the Great,
was a landing problem to the Arabic geographers. It was generally
regarded as lying at the north-eaffem end of the habitable world, and
was vaguely confused with the Great Wall of China. But Ibn Battuta
could have had no idea that China was within the Wall, and his queffion
appears to have been put at random, perhaps on hearing some chance
reference to the Great Wall.

Marco Polo also speaks of a race of cannibals in the mountains

Hang-chow, and would indeed cut out Hang chow altogether ,
(2) there is no evidence for the cxiilcnce of a frequented trade
route (such as Ibn Battuta’s route is represented to be) through Kien-
chang fu

Since Ibn Battuta took 31 days for the journey to Hangchow,
while Marco Polo took 27, travelling in the reverse dirc£bon, there are
very good grounds for assuming that their routes were subAandaUy
the Mme In this case the mofl natural idcntificauon for Qan jan fu
IS Fuchow In favour of this arc (i) the size of the city, with
a governor of its own and a large garrison (which corresponds very
well with Marco Polo’s desenpuon) , (2) the arrival of “ a very large
wssel at the port, since Marco Polo expressly flatcs that “From
Zayton ships come this way right up to the city of Fuju by the nver
1 have told you of, and ’tis in this way that the preaous wares of India
come hither ” The name which Marco Polo gives to the diflnfi of
Fuchow, Chonka or Concha (the proper name of the city being Chin
wang), may possibly explain the transformation into Qan jan fu.
On the other hand, Marco Polo allows only five days from Fuchow
to Zaytun, which would suggcfl some place further up the Mm river

Dulauner sugg^ed that Qan jan fu may ^and for Chm kiang fu
at the jun&on of the Yang tsi and the Grand Canal, in which case
It should come between Khansi and Khin bihq (Peking) Similar
inflances of misplacing are, as will have been noticed, not infrequent
wth Ibn Battuta, but Chin kiang fu scarcely seems large enough to
fit his dcscnption M Fcrrand takes Qan jan fu to be Marco Polo’s
Kenjanfu, the old capital of China, now Si an fu on the Wei nver m
Shen SI, which was called Khumdin by the Arabic geographers This
identification, however, hangs together with M Ferrand’s thesis that
Ibn Battuta did not go to China at all It is safefl to assume ather
^t Qan jan fu was a name used by the Muslim merchants for Fuchow
(hke Zaytun for Ts’wan-chow), or that Ibn Battuta has confused two
similar sounding names

The GhiJta is the name given to the wide plain covered with
fruit trees around Damascus

It would be a wafte of time to search for anything corresponding
to this name on a modern map of China, and its position can be deter

NOTES

possible that it was not a place-name at all, but the name of some
Turko-Tatar commander (? Baydn Qutlugli=“ Bayan the Lucky ”)
which Ibn Battuta erroneously took to be the name of a town.

It is agreed by all travellers, both Christian and Muslim, that
what Marco Polo calls “ the mo^ noble city of Kinsay . . . beyond
dispute the fineil and nobleft in the world ” was indeed the largest
city in the world in the fourteenth century. The admiration it aroused
lent itself to exaggeration, and when even Marco Polo avers that
“ it hath an hundred miles of compass. And there are in it twelve
thousand bridges of ^lone, for the moft part so lofty that a great fleet
could pass beneath them,” it is not to be wondered at that in Ibn.
Battuta’s account there are, in Yule’s phrase, “ several very questionable
statements.” The name Khansd is an Arabic modification (to accord
with the name of a famous Arabic poetess), as Kinsay, Cansay, Cassay,
etc., are European modifications, of the Chinese King-sxe “ Capital,”
Hang-chow having been the capital of the Sung synaSly from 1127 to
1276.

“ The word translated citadel means “ inner city occupied by the
ruler or governor.” The viceroy’s palace was not in the centre of
Hang-chow, however, but at the southern end.

In the Chain of HiHories we are told that “ On reaching the age
of eighty a man is exempted from paying the poll-tax, and receives
a grant from the imperial treasury. The Chinese say of this “We made
him pay the tax when he was young ; now that he is old we will give
him a pension ’ ” (Ferrand, Voyage du marchand Sulayman, p. 63).

Qurtay appears to be a contradtion of Qajitiy, a common
Turkish title, but no governor of this name is mentioned in Chinese
works, so far as is known. It is probable that it was the title given to
the commander by the Turkish troops, like many other of the terms
employed by Ibn Battiita in this sedlion, which are not Chinese but
Turkish or Persian. In the same way he gives as the name of the
Emperor his Perso-Turkish title of “ king ” ; see below, note 32.

Tozoa or tuwi is a Turkish word meaning feaft or festival.

Yule, remarking that the “ pretty cadence ” is precisely that of

t won’t go home till mornings
gives a “ somewhat free ” rendering :

My heart given up to emotions.

Was o’erwhelmed in waves like the ocean’s ;

But betaking me to my devotions.

My troubles were gone from me !

The laik line of the poem, however, neither reads nor scans properly.

Marco Polo also speaks at length of pleasure parties on the lake,
but does not mention mimic battles (II, 205).

This statement is jufliifiably challenged by Yule, who regards

with Marco Polo’s account (11,415*20) a long note discussing possible
originals for this gigantic bird. One or two Arabic writers had already
shown some sceptiasm on the subjed, and Ibn Battuta, it will be
noticed, is prudently non*committal His narrative certainly suggefls
the part played by mirage or abnormal rcfradion in giving currency to
this widespread dory. ,

* In 1340 the Moorish Sultan Abu’l-Hasan led an army into Spain,
which was totally defeated by Alphonso XI of Cailile at the Rio Salado,
near Tarifa, on 30th Oftober of the same year. Alphonso followed up
his viftory by the capture of Algeciras in 1 342, but died in 135° while
attempting to retake Gibraltar. The siege of Gibraltar on that
occasion is referred to by Ibn Battuta in the following chapter.

® The relations between Shaykh Hasan and Sultan Abii Sa‘ld have
already been explained by Ibn Battuta (above, p. 100). This Shaykh
Hasan “ the Great,” after an eight-years’ struggle with his rival Shaykh
Hasan “ the Little,” grandson of the Amir Chubin, founded the
JaM’ir or llkanl dyna^ly, which continued to rule in ‘Iriq and Adhar-
bayjan until the early years of the fifteenth century.

® Hit and Ana ^lill appear on our maps, on the Euphrates to the
N.W. of Baghdad. Hadltha, now called Qal'at Habulia, was about
3 5 miles below Ana, and AnWr, formerly one of the principal cities
of ‘Ir^q, some di^ance below Hit, at the head of the Isi canal, the fir^
of the great navigable canals uniting the Euphrates with the Tigris.
The diftrifl of Hit was especially remarkable for its immense quantities
of fruit and its dense population.

This plague was the famous “ Black Death,” which wrought
indescribable havoc in the Muslim lands during this year, and is
probably to be accounted a catastrophe no less^ overwhelming than
the invasions of the Mongols and Tamerlane. Ibn Battuta’s figures ,
are not greatly exaggerated ; indeed some eSlimates are much higher.
The historian Ibn Khaldun, whose father was one of the viftims at
Tunis, speaks of it as “ the devouring peStilence which ravaged the
nations and carried off the men of this generation, which destroyed
and effaced many of the fair fruits of civilization. . . . Cities and
palaces were laid in ruins, roads and waymarks were obliterated. . . •

Iwalatan is the plural of Walata, the place consisting, according
to Leo Africanus, of three hamlets. Modern maps show two places
called Walata ; Ibn Battuta’s fwalatan is the southern one at 17.02 N.,
6.44 W. It took the place of Ghana as the southern terminus of the
trans-Saharan trade-route in the thirteenth century (see note 21 below),
being built (according to Hartmann, Mit. Sem. Or. Stud., XV^, 162)
on the site of the old Berber town of Audaghusht.

^ The baobab tree {^Adansonia digitafa), which rapidly attains a
very great girth, is frequently artificially hollowed for the Storage of
water, and thus enables settlements to be made in places where there
are no weUs. These trees were introduced for that purpose into the
Eastern Sudan (Kordofan) from WeSt Africa in the eighteenth century,
but from Ibn Battuta’s description it would appear that artificial hollow-
ing was not yet pratftised there.

Manding, and was the name of the ruling tribe, not of the town.

The site of the latter has long been a matter of controversy. Cooley
(pp. 81-2) placed it near Segu, at a village called Binni “seven miles
above Samee,” and took the Sansara river to be a channel of the Niger .
Dehfosse' {H.S.N., II, 181) accepts the view that the site of MaUi
was “ a place situated on the left bank of the Niger, S.W. of Niamina
and S.S.W. of Moribugu, level with the villages of Konina and Kondu.
. . . Malli lay therefore a little to the weil of the present road from
Niamina to Kulikoro.” The name Sansara, given by Ibn Battuta to
the ^ream ten miles north of M^lh, was found by Barth to be ^HU
applied to the small tributary which joins the Niger ju^l below Niamina.
Marquart (105, igi) prefers Cooley’s view, but puts M^IM a little
lower down the river, a day’s march above SiUe (Sele), and identifies
it with Kugha or Juga, the Quioquia of the Portuguese.

[Since the writing of this note and preparation of the map, I find
that MM .Vidal and Gaillard claim to have definitely e^blished that
the name of Malli was Nyani, and that it was situated “ near the present
village of Nyani, on the left bank of the Sankarani, a little to the north
of Balandugu and to the south of Jeliba (Dieliba), the other capital of
the same empire,” t.e. at 11.22 N., 8.18 W., about 150 miles S.W.
of the position shown on' the map. See Demombynes, trans. of
al-‘Omari’s Masalik al-Absar, p. 52, note 2.]

Delafosse remarks that “ D6gM is the name of a kind of vulture
and also that of a demon among the Banmana and the Malinke, and
is often given as a name to men.”

The following is a brief account of the early negro empires.

The earliest Sudanic empire was that of Ghtoa (which was really
the title of its later Soninke rulers). This empire was founded about
the fourth century, apparently by some white immigrants.. The site
of its capital seems to have changed more than once. From the ninth
to the eleventh century the Soninke of Kumbi were mailers of the
Ghana empire, until its deftru£tion by the Almoravids of Morocco in
1076. A number of small Elates were constituted on its ruins, and
one of these, the Soninke dynaSly of the Kannte, whose capital was at
Sosso (to the weSl of Sansanding), recaptured Ghdna in 1^03 and
restored the Soninke empire. To this was due also the foundation
of WaMta, as the Muslim inhabitants of GhSna, refusing to live under
infidel rule, established themselves at the water-point of Walata or
Bird (see note 6). The conqueror, Sumanguru, was killed in battle
in 1235 with the Malinke, whose king SunjSta or Marf jSta annexed
the Soninke empire, was converted to Islam (see p. 329), and established
the new capital at MSlh. He captured and destroyed GhSna in 1240,
and died in 1255. After a succession of rulers, the next emperor of
importance was MusS (Ibn Battdta’s Mansa Musa), in whose reign
(1307-32) the MSlh empire reached its wideSt dimensions. Mdsa
was the grandson of a siSter of SunjSta. The reign of his son and

successor Mansi Maghin (t 332-<S) marks a brief retrogression, but
under Mfisd’s brother Sulaymin (1336-59), the Mill! regained mucli
of their power and preiUge. "With his death there set in a sharp
decline, accentuated by civil wars. The Milll kingdom, however,
iHlI remained the moft powerful of the Niger stales until the rise of
the Songhay kingdom (see note 32), and did not finally disappear
until 1670.

The addition of “ under all circumihinces ” is a gentle hint that
things are not so well as they might be.

“ The eve of the 27th ^madin is known as the Lay/at a/~QaJr,

Quri Mansi is placed by Delafosse near the present villages of
Kolri and Massamana, N.E. of Sansanding, and not far from Ibn
Basra’s former halting place at Kiisakhfi (see note 12),

® Mima seems to have been one of the chief towns in the diihia
which Ibn Battiita metidons above under the name of Zigha (see note
t 3 )« In later times the name wasr applied to the area above the lakes
(and^ possibly including them), corresponding to part of modern
Masina. According to Barth, the site of Mfraa is iHU in eriflence,
though now desert^, a few miles weft of Lcre (Trave/tf Enel, ed.,

V.^487).

Timbuktu was annexed by Mansi Miisi after the conqueft of
Gao in 1325. In 1333 the town was pillaged and burned In a raid
hy the Mossi from Yatenga (Upper Volta), but was rebuilt by Sulay-
min shortly after his accession. The poet as-Sihill met Mansi Mfisi
at Mecca during the Pilgrimage, and was persuaded by the sultan to
accompany him back to the Sudan. He was the architeft of the
moj^ues at Gao and Timbuktu, and died at Timbuktu in 1 346.

Gao or Gaogao (which is apparently a variant of the original
name Kflgha) was an important trading ftation at the convergence
not only of the salt route from the weft and the trans-Saharan route
pom the north-eaft, but also the trans-continental trade-route. Early
m the eleventh century it became the capital of the ftate of Songhay
(Sopghoy), on the conversion to Islam of the firft Songhay dynaity',
which is said to have been of Berber origin. The Songhay kingdom
was annexed to Milll by Mansi Musi in 1325, but in 1335 the

dynafty was re-e^lablished (with the title of sorinP)^ though it ^lill
remained in at lea^l nominal subjeftion to MdlH until the reign of
Sonnf ‘All (1465-92), the la^l ruler of the original Berber line, who
enlarged his kingdom chiefly at the expense of Mdllf. He was suc-
ceeded by his Soninke general Muhammad (1493-1529), the founder
of the askia dynasty, who brought Songhay to the height of its power.
The Songhay empire was broken up and the dyna^ extinguished by
the Moroccans, who captured Gao and Timbuktu in 1591.

'''' The existence of a cowry exchange in the Mdllf empire, alongside
the salt exchange, is conclusive evidence of the commercial relations
across the African continent referred to in note 14, as cowries are found
in Africa only on the ea^t coafl: between the Equator and Mozambique
{Grande Encyclopidie s.v. Cauri). In Ibn Battuta’s time, however,
cowries were imported by merchants from the north (al-‘Omari 75-76).

T^he description of the Bard^ma tribe, and particularly of their
women, corresponds very closely with Barth’s description of the

Barth added that although “ nothing is knovra of the exigence of copper
hereabouts, a red salt is obtained from mines there. Gautier and
hudeau {Missions au Sahara, II, 257) also remark on the absence of
copper in the Sahara except at Tamegroun in the Ougarta range
(29.15 N,, 1.40 W.), and ^late that all the copper used in Air and in
Ahaggar comes from Europe. The absence of copper at Tegidda is
confirmed by F R. Rodd, who thinks that Ibn Battfita’s Tagaddd
nmst be looked for “ at some considerable distance south of Agades ”

( eop e of the Veil, 452-6). The meaning of the word Tegidda,
accor mg to the latter, is “ a small hollow where water collefts,’* and
^e name is applied to a number of different places {Cf. H.S.N., II, 193 ;
Marquart, 98) The existence of copper mines at Tagadda is, however,
confirmed by al- Omarf on the authority of Mansd Musd (tr. Demom-
bynes, I, 80-81). ^

only becaufe they are written in a very fo- tain the/e

Seignelay's Library, feenis to be the only
one of its kind. Its Age may be fuffici-
ently afcertained by the Character it is in*
but we have a plain Proof that it was writ-

em Geographies are methodifed by the
fame Plan ; but it affords you no Pofitions
no more than mod: of the reft, if we ex-
cept the Geography of Abulfeda, to be re-
sumed hereafter. But this Nubian Geo~
fftdphy containing the molt curious Parti-
culars we read in the Authors that have
appeared fince, whether as to natural Hi-
ftory, or the Cuftoms and Manners of dif-
ferent Nations, we may fafely pronounce
it to have been pillaged by later CompL- *.
lers : And very remarkable it is That this
Nubian Geographer, whofoever he was, is
beholden to our two Authors for moft of
what he relates concerning the Navi-
gation of the Eafiern Ocean, of the Indies y
and of China, which alone may evince
*hem to have been of the higheft Antiqui-
\ : among the Writers of their own Nation.

curious Things they tell us, and which are
fcarce to be met with elfewhere.
Jmons o- ® ne °f then chief Remarkables is the
thers, the Courfe the Arabs and the Perjians former-
old Ou-fe ly iteered froin Bajjbra and Siraf to the
fteendfor j n jj es allc [ China ; and inverfely the Courfe
fleered by the Ckincfe for Arabia and Per-
Jia. Many of the Learned who thought
with Martini That the Chinefe failed by the
direction of the Ccmpafs as far as Ceylon,
and there planted a Colony, have perfuad-
ed others That this Voyage was perform-
ed by Obfervation. And hence they
concluded it almoft impoffible but the
active and induftrious Arabs muft have
borrowed the ufeful Invention from the
Chinefe, and "have applied it in their long
Runs; it appearing by Hiftory that they
failed great Lengths, long before the Por-
ting uefe difcovered the E aft em Parts. Such
was the Opinion of the late Mr. Thevenot,
who knew nothing of our two Authors,
and who being very much prepofTefied in
favor of the Chinefe, concurred with Mar-
tini That they had had the Ufe of the
Compafs, and that they had failed to the
Jfland of Ceylon, and even much farther ;
while Vojjius infifts on the fame, as a
Fact not in the leaft to be doubted, tho*
he does not vouchfafe us the leaft Proof
to countenance his ArTertion. Our Au*-
thors.fo plainly and circumftantially ob-
ferve to us That the Indian and Chinefe
Ships did not ftir beyond Sir of, that we
cannot but fubmit to them, and efpecially

as

as they, at the (lime time, acquaint us They
dared not go farther, becaufe their Veilels
were unable to ftand the Aflaults of the
open Sea : But it is not becaufe our two
Authors make no mention of the Compafs
That we venture to affirm the Chinefe and
Arabians knew nothing of it; we have
other Arguments not to be refitted : But
tho' we had no other way of proving this
Ignorance upon them, the Courfe they
fleered would fufficiently declare it; they
forfaking it as too tedious and dangerous,
as foon as they came to have the Compafs.

In thefe Accounts alfo we have many Vley con-
curious Obfervables upon China, which a- iain ma *y
gree with Marco Polo, and are even con- v %y* k f° U
firmed by the moft fincere Travellers of whiri are
later Times : If others there are which confirmed
clam with what we elfe where read, they ty late
ought not for that Reafon alone to be mi- ^ vaveilerS -
ftrufted, fince great Alterations have be-
fallen that Country in the long Courfe of
eight hundred Years or upwards. By the
Lights Martini conveys to us in his Chi"
nefe Atlas, we difcover the Truth of many
Things that before appeared fabulous in
Marco Polo, and the fame may hereafter
be difcovered of the doubtful Things in
our Authors.

Martini is the firft that told us The
great Cities of China had often changed
their Names; and very poflible it is that
the Names in our two Authors may have
obtained in their Time; and tho' they are
defective in Pofitions, we prefently know

them by the Obfervations the Europeans
have made } for it is in vain to look for
them in the Arabian Writings ; tho' a
contrary Opinion has taken fuch deep
Root among us, that it is feemingly a
Ralhnefs to difpute tne Point. John Bap"
ti Ram tt/W) a Man of great Judgment
and very exteniive Learning, having feen
a fmall Part o£ Abidfedas Geography, and
therein obferved the Names of fome Places
mentioned by Marco Po/o y conceived a very
great V eneration for the Work. Caftaldo
made ufe ot it alio for feveral Pofitions ;
and Schickard cited fome parts of it, and
promifed a Tranflation of the whole.
Greaves a learned Englijhman actually tran-
slated it, and publifhed two of the Clima-
tes. Thevenot attempted the Thing after
him, but dying, the Copy of his Yerfion
fell into foreign Hands. Ail the Learned,
and,upon what they have faid, all that were
Strangers to the Oriental Tongues, have
fed up the Public with the excel live Com-
mendations they have beflowed on Abul-
fcda's Work, tho' often without knowing
why or wherefore. Andrew Midler who
printed Marco Polo in Latin with tedious
Diflertations, and particularly one upon
Cathay or Catai, regrets a Work Schickard
had promifed, concerning Tartary and Chi"
ndy which he was to have extracted from
Abulfeda, and was to have been like his

not print this Work, or tranflate AbuU
feda, according to his Word ; and it mull
be moil readily believed, after fo many
learned Orientalifts have faid it, That the
Geography of this Author would com«?
pletely illuftrate Metres Polo, and afford
us a fair Profpect of China, as Mullet
will have it. We happen to live in an Age
that has been morl: minutely and almorl
trirlingiy inquiiitive into what concerns
the Lives and Writings of the Learned :
But as it is feldom thefe Compilers confult
any Thing farther than what is contained
in Prefaces, and are perfect Strangers
both to the Books and Authors menti-
tioned, it may not be amifs to fay what
is true of Schickard, and afterwards of
Abulfeda.

Schickard, who was a Profeflbr in the U- j n j c ^
niverlity of 'Tubingen, got a large Share of count tf
Reputation by a Work he intitled Tarich Schic-
ftegum Per/it ; which took Birth from ^^
the Difcovery of a Genealogy written
upon a long Scroll, which began with
Adam, and ended with a Moh.amedan Prince
who had had it done • this Schickard
took for a very great Curiofity, tho'
nothing in the World is lefs fo. He
copied the Names, which he often read
mirtakenly enough, and having collected
all that could relate to thole Princes }
when he comes to the Kings of Perjia,
he does not fay a Word of them that
he does not borrow from Teixeira, a
fortuguefe Author who writes from the

To ■ this he adds fome Citations from
the Book intitled JukhaJJin, which has
many Curious Particulars of Oriental Hi-
ftory, fome Paffages from the Arabian
Geography, but nothing Original. We
are lure he had not the leaft Knowledge
of the Authors that wrote this Hiitory,
which is quite Fabulous, if we except
what is faid of the latter Kings ; and
we need only read Tcixeira, or the Tran-
flated Abridgment of the Per/tan Hiftories
called Leb Towarich, in the fourth Volume
of the late Mr. Tbevenot's Collection, by
Gautptin'y to be convinced of the little
value of Scbickard's Work, and how un^
x equal he was to the task of writing the
Hiitory of the Jengbiz-kbanid Tartars, he
ventured to Promife.
He alfi Moil: certain it is alfo that he in like
pomUedto ]\j anner prromifed to Tranflate Abul-

Abulfeda. f e ^ a » ^ ut Greaves, who, by the Report
of thofe who knew him, was a very
worthy Man, not caring to join with
Scbickard in the Undertaking, wrote to
him about it. To which he anfwered,
That the Manufcript in the Vienna Li-
brary, was fo obfcure that it was abfo-
lutely impoifible to tranflate it : He co-
pied it however, and his Copy being
afterwards purchafed in Germany, is now
in the King's Library ; annexed to it
there is part of the Work tranflated,

to pronounce it very much an Overmatch

for Schickard. Greaves was indeed com-
pletely qualified } for belides that he was
a perfect Mailer of the Oriental Tongues,
and had travelled in the Lev ant ^ he was
acquainted with the Principal Authors,
was profoundly learned, and a con-
fummate Mathematician. He gave us a
Specimen of his Work when, in the
Year MDCL, he publifhed the Defcripti-
on and Tables of the two Provinces,
of Chowarazm and Mawaralnahra or the
Tranfoxane y in Arabic and Latin. In his
Preface he acquaints us he had finifhed
the whole Tranflation of Abulfeda y and
he declared as much to fome of his learn-
ed Friends ; but being thrown into Pri-
fon by the Parliament, for lending Money
to King Charles II. his Houfe was ran-
facked, and his Work loft : This we had
from Mr. Hardy y a very ingenious Gen-
tleman, who knew him intimately well.

The two Climates Greaves has given Of
us, are one of the moft curious Parts of S rea Jp f
all Abulfedas Geography • for it takes ]*"£ j£
notice of Cities unknown to the anci- bulfeda>
ent Geographers, and which we are only
told of by the Mohammedan Hiftory, anci
our Modern Travels ; and what is more,
thefe Parts were fubje£t to the Seljukid

Jity ; and fo Abrrffeda y who dyed in the
Year of Chrift MCCCXLV, had a great
number of pretty exact Tables whereby
to fettle the true Places of the Cities he*
mentions. But notwithstanding all this,
there are Differences of one, and fome-
times two Degrees in the two Climates
before us ; which is nothing to what there
is, of the lame kind, throughout the whole
Body of the Work, which it may not
be amifs to inftance by a few Examples.

Body of the Book y fays in their behalf as careful Observers
and intelligent Mathematicians , muff be inccnfifient with
himfelf to fuppofe thefe Numbers are mere Blunders
and Inaccuracies. Abulfeda feems to be no more than a.
ColleBor, as may be clearly gathered from that Prince's
own Preface, and from what Mr. Renaudot here ac-
knowledges. Uhat thefe various Longitudes are perplexing,
every Body mujl allow , it being hard to determin which
is to be preferred, as it is impoffible to find out the exact
Meridian of each ; but that they are flips of Ignorance or
Negligence cannot well be fuppofed. Befides, it is well
known, '[that were any Man, like Abulfeda, to collef£
from our own befi Geographers, or rather Hydrographers,
for what concerns the Sea-Coafi in particular, tho* fo
well known to mofi of the European Navigators, they
would be often found to vary a number of Degrees from
each other ; we need only inftance in the Coafi of France,
next to us, and the Coafi of Brafil in America, which
now are thought to be rectified, as they doubtlefs are :
But theft Variations did not arife from the want of a
fixed Meridian, but purely from a mifiaken Reckoning
or Computation. If fome of our befi Geographers then
have till very lately abounded with Errors of this kind, it
is fomewhat unreafonable to expeB the Orientals to be
quite free from them ; and as they fay, The Know-
ledge of a Part, is to be preferred to an Ignorance
of the Whole ; fo if we can to a Degree or two fettle
upon the Longitude of mop of the noted Cities in the

not fuppofe it, and therein we have where-
withal to commend his Sincerity : For it
is to be obferved that of about five hun-
dred and fifty Cities to be found in him,
(for Copies vary as to the exact Number)
he gives no one Pofition for exa£t, except
that of Hamaoi Hamath. After this we may
guefs what Ailiffcance we are to hope from
this fo applauded Work , towards the
Reformation of our Eafiern Geography;
as alfo the Account we are to make of Po-
iitions which vary fo many Degrees of
Longitude from each other, and are not
much better agreed as to Latitude.

face to the little he fays of the chief Cities
of this Country : " China is, on the Weft,

" from the Indies ; on the South, by the

a known • and the rather as we have no
a Body that has been there, of whom
c< to inform ourfelves as we ought ; where-
" fore we will confine ourfelves to what
a has been written before us." After this
he ventures to name fome Cities, but fo
difguifed, that it is impoflible to guefs at
them, except Khanfa, which may be the
Ghiinfai of Marco Polo, and Zeiiun, which
he alfo mentions. In another Place he
fpeaks of Cambalic or Chanbalig, and Catai y
upon the Teftimony of Ebn Said : Thefe \
Paflages Mailer has recurred to y and they,
it muft be faid, confirm what the Author
himfelf confeifes of the little Knowledge
he had of thofe Parts. With the fame In-

ginning of his Univerfal Hiftory.

would have made him who did not under-
Hand him, at the Head of whom we mull
place thole who ventured to tranflate him,
Arias Montanus, and after him Conftantine
J'Empereur. They both tranilated from an
Edition printed at Conftantinopk, which
being erroneous, and not very fair, might
eaiily puzzle thofe who did not know
whereabouts he was. Accordingly Arias
Mont anus , committed horrid Faults, which
the Dutch Tranflator did not afterwards
perceive ; and both of them by their ill
reading of many proper Names of Cities,
People, and Provinces, have formed ima-
ginary ones which never were. Hence
we every where meet with Eliman, which
never was, inftead of at Yaman,* which is
Arabia the Happy, and many fuch Faults ;
Dougziin) a People unknown, inftead of
Drouziin, the Drifts, the Ille of Nikro-
kis\ the Hachifches, a People who cut
Princes with a Saw, and a hundred more
of the fame Stamp* Arias Montanus left
his Readers the Task of untying thefe
difficult Knots ; but Conftantin YEmpereur
with a more afluming Air, undertakes to
illuitrate his Authors by Notes, which he
has crammed with Arabian and Hebrew
Pailages quite wide of his Point ; for he
had them not from original Authors, or

from Geographers and Hiftorians; he
did not fo much as know one of them ex-
cept the Nubian Geographer, and Elmacin
whom he often did not underftand. For
Inflance, he takes up Benjamin for talking
of the Kalif of Egypt who reigned in his
Time, becaufe truly he finds another in
Ehnacin of the Family of the AbaJJidSy
whereas a Man muft be quite a Novice to
• Mohammedan Hiftory, not to know that,
in Egypt j the Fat emit es declared themfelves
Kalifs, and withdrew Obedience from the
AbaJJids, whom they gave out to be Ufur-
pers of the Empire and the Pontificat.
Several Greater Men by far than Confiantin FEm-

%wc P ereur nave been guilty of as great Abfur-
mittedvafi dities in fpeaking of what they did not
Faults in know. So Jofeph Scaliger attempting the
Oriental Origin of the Title Prefier John, common-
Bijiory. Yy a ppiy ec i t0 tne King of Ethiopia, offers
one which is neither Perfian, as he pre-
tends, nor yet Arabic. He is in like
Manner miftaken in the Etymons of the
Per/tan Names, and prefuming to exhibit a
Series of Kalifs and Soltans of the prin-
cipal States from the Rife of Mohamme-
difm, which Abraham Zacut, the Jm\
had done very exactly, he mangled, all
the Names, becaufe he faw them in He*
Irew only, and knew them not originally.
Erpenius, tho* a good Matter of the Ara-
lie, is guilty of an infinit number of Faults
in his Tranflation of Ehnacin, as well in
the Text, as in the Geography and proper
Names: So that we may juftly fay we

have no body, befides Golius and Greaves^
that we can depend upon for the Eaftem
Geography ; to whom indeed we may add
d'Herbelot, whofe Bibliotheque Orientals is
full of very curious Learning, tho J by the
carelefsnefs of the Editors, it is a Work
not fo perfect as the Author could have
made it, intimate as he was with the beft
Arabian, Tnrkifh and Perfian Books.

There have appeared ibme new Produc- °^f° e
tions full of Eaftem Erudition, which it ?/ f ^*
may not be amiis to fay a Word to. Of the Hap-
thefe there is a Voyage to Arabia the Happy, py.
wherein are many curious Remarks with
regard to the prelent Times. The Editor
quotes Abulfeda's Arabia, but he excells
that Geographer, who knew but two or
three of the principal Cities. What he fays
of the Sharif s of Mecca, does not exactly a-
gree with the molt certain Records of 'Mo*
hammedifm-, for not only the Kalifs of the
firft Race were Matters in that Country ;
but Saladin, a devout Mohammedan, if there
ever was one, made a Conquer! of it by
his Brother, and drove out Abdalnabi, tho*
he pretended to be of the Race of their
Prophet.

Sir John Chardin, in the laft Edition of Chardin^
his Voyage to Perfia, has favored us with &awb t
ample Diflertations on the Morality of the
ancient Perjians, as if extracted from their
own Authors : And yet moffc of what he
fays is borrowed from the Guliftan of the
Poet Sdadi, who was, above iixty Years
ago,tranflated into German by Okarius, and

into Latin by Gcntius. The Remainder
is no more than Sentences for the moft
part borrowed from the ancient Greeks,
and tranflated into feveral of the Eaftern
Tongues, and no more peculiar to the
Perftans than to every other Nation in the
World. Again , Mohammedifm glares
throughout the whole, and what they
would pafs upon us for the Perftan Philo-
fophy and Theology, is taken out of the
Koran, and belongs to the Perftans no far-
ther than they have naturalized it of their
Language.
Hyde\r Dr. Hyde, a learned Englijhman, has un-

Reiig. Vet. dertaken a Work of greater Depth, where-
^ €r f' by to explain the Religion of the ancient
Perftans, and which is the more likely to
impofe on the Reader, as it is full of Quo-
tations from Perftan and Arabian Writers.
It alfo excites the Curiofity by the novelty
of the Defign, which is to juftify the
Worjhip of Fire among the old Perftans,
and to prove it to have been a Ceremony
of mere Indifference, which intentionally
aimed at the true God ; for according to him
the origin of this Fire~Worfeip was fet on foot
by the Ifraelites, who, when they were led
away Captive,brought it from Jerufakm, and
retained it to the latter Times, which no
body ever knew before Hyde. We under-
ftood by Greek and Latin Authors That
this Perfian Superftition and feveral o-
thers were known to them. The ancient
Church honoured a great number of Mar-
tyrs who fuffered Death, in the cruel Per*

fecution?

fays Hyde, the Greeks and the Latins knew
nothing at all of the Perfian Religion,
and thefe Martyrs were obftinate head-
Urong People. In ihort, to prove this
Paradox, he has no Authority but
a wretched Per/tan Poet, who wrote a-
bout two hundred Years ago : Any Soul
alive may be milled this way, and efpeci-
ally when ignorant of the worth and au-
thenticity or the Authors relied on.

PREFACE,

Moft of the Things, our Accounts con-
tain, concerning the Manners and Cuftoms
of the Indians j are confirmed by Modern
Travellers, and the Portuguefc, as alfo by
the Arabian and Per/tan Geographers.

The Defcription of the Tea-bufh, and
the Drink the Chinefe make of its Leaf,
is the more remarkable^ as many very-
great Men of our Times, have reported it
not to be of fuch ancient Date } and by
what our Authors fay of it in general, it is
plain they were perfectly informed about
it. As much may be faid of the Musk
Creature they dwell on ; and feveral other
Rarities, illuftrated in the Notes.

We never before heard that Chriftians had
been formerly numerous in China ; for all
that has been written by the Portuguefe, and
others about St. tfhomass Preaching there,
can never ftand upon the feeble Support oi
far fetched Conjec~ture,and bare Probabili-
ty : The Chinefe and Syriac Infcription in-
deed, difcovered in the Year MDCXXV,

China in the eight Century at the lateft ;
but no Trace of this Million was left, and
Kircher and Miller are widely out in their
Explanations of this Monument ; but here
you will have it illuftrated in a Diiferta-
tion apart, by which it will appear That
when our two Authors fay, there were
numbers of Chriftians involved in the uni-
verfal Maflacre,at the time a total Revolu-
tion befel the Empire, it is not impoffible
but thofe who thus perifhed were defend-

The fame Paflage gives us to underftand 'The Lights

dan^ mentioned in the Infcription as be- Geography.
ing at that Time the Capital of the Em-
pire. Tho' moft of the Arabs confirm
-what is faid in the Infcription, and have
the Name of this City of Cumdan^ and
among the reft the Nubian Geographer ; yet
was this City unknown, his Tranflators
miitaking it for the Name of the River
that wafhed the City, inftead of the City
itfelf. Thofe who undertook to explain
the Syriac Infcription, aflbrded us nothing
but empty Conjectures; whereas by our
two Mohammedans we learn two important
Fa£ts which carl a great light upon the
Chinefe Hiftory ; Jirft that Cumdan was for-
merly the Capital of the Empire, and
fecondly that the fame was Nankin^ a Thing
unknown to the beft that have written about
China.

By them alfo we underftand That the oftheGty
City of St. Thome was not fo called by ^f * Tho ~

thought, feeing it was known by the fame

feemingly unknown to the Arabs, if we
except Ptolomy's Tables. By them again,
we might clear up many Paflages in the
Nubian Geography, which is by no means
fb contemptible a Book as fome of the
Learned would have had it; tho' on the
other hand it is not deferving of the very
high Account iome have made of it.Such as
it is, it may ferve for a Sample of the Eaft-
ern Geographies ; for it is void of Politions,
a Defect it has in common with mort of
the reft ; and indeed they might as well
he omitted as given with the Variety, and
Incertitude in Abnlfeda, There is nothing
of this kind tolerably exact among the
Per/tan and Arabian Geographers, but the
Tables of Ulug Beig, and Naffir Eddin
tranflated by Greaves. The Nubian Geo-
grapher, tho' his Work has r been printed
in Arabic, and turned into Latin, has been
of no great Service, becaufe the Tranila-
tors having nothing but the printed Copy
before them, which is very erroneous,
could not reftore their Text by Manu-
fcripts, which are very fcarce.

reformed the Calendar, and erected the
Jelakan Epoch ; fo that a Reader that un-
aerrlands no Arabic, or is unacquainted
with Eaftem Hiftory, would not know him
again by the Name of Makk Cbab. The
fame it is with the Names of Cities and
Provinces, which are varioufly written by
Europeans, according to their ieveral Rules ■
of Orthography, which are oftentimes hard
to be understood. Thus what the Arabs call
Aderbijan [_Adarbejanj is fpelt one way by
a German, and another way by a Portu-
guefe. Okarius writes it Aderbitzian, Tei-

The Eajfern Tongues have not been lefs

for the Geographers of thofe Parts, aware
of the Dete£t of their Characters or

Pronunciation, afcertain it as well as they
can, by naming every Vowel in proper
Names ; and feldom it is they agree with
the common way of pronouncing. We

Limits of a jingle Note. Mr. Renaudot is perhaps wore
accurate in his way of fpelling the Eajlem Names , than
any other of Us Nation, or perhaps any Foreigner what-
foever ; but tho\ fenjibje of the DefeB of the French

have endeavored to open the way to thofe

There are two ways of pronouncing the Arabic, the
one peculiar to Afric, the other to Aiia ; which loft being
the Parent of this extenjive tongue, it feems as if we
had no room to doubt but the Pronunciation there, ii
to be preferred to the fame in Afric : But that the A-
frican Way Jhould, on the other hand, chief y prevail
in Europe, is no Wonder, confidering how long, and
how nearly we have had Commerce with the Moors. The
Africans pronounce el for al, and Melik for Malec or
Malek, andfo on ; the Afiatics being more open and full
in their Utterance. But it is not only as to Vowels that
we are at fome Uncertainty, but even with regard to Confo~
wants ; whence you have the Ambiguities to he obferved in
fome parts of this Book, as the Wood called Hairzan in one
Place, and Chairzan in another; the Kingdom cfGt-
zaz [Jeraz] or Haraz ; the Province of "Curiftan or Cuzi-
ftan. Now thefe fever al Ambiguities arife from the exact
refemblance of fome Arabic Letters with others which "
are barely dijiinguijhed from them by a Point, or two, or
three, either above the Letter, or below it ', for ex ample ,

rfhe firfl Letter of Hairzan is naked thus ^ , of Chair-

the K is naked thus j , in Cuziftan the Z is with a
Point thus j : tfhere is another R and Z, but the Cafe
between them is exactly parallel It appears then that thefe
Variations are produced either by Omiffion, or Redundancy,
if by Omiffon the Points are wanting : But if by Redun-
dancy, the Points are too much ; and that the mofi diligent
Tranfcriber may, in the Courfe of along Copy, be guilty
of both, muft be readily granted.

Two or three Authors, who but copy
from each other, fuffice to give birth to a
Notion which fpreads unexamined by thofe

as to Vowels ; fo that when we negleB them, and, run-
ning Riot after our Fancy, deviate from them, nothing
can excufe us. Upon this Head many might be /evenly
accufed, but we will only inftance in Pe'tis de la Croix,
Senior, who, in his Hiflory of Genghis Khan, has
all along Capfchac /crKipjak, Alfchafche for Alfliafh,
or the County of Shaft, Carizme for Chowarazm,

Few Gentlemen who have not fome previous Notion of

that might injlruB them therein. In Jhort, the Evils
of this Prefumption, or Vanity, or Negligence, or call it
what you will, are of the mofl difcouraging Kind, and,
fuch as claim a thorough and fpeedy Reformation.

Hifiorians, and Geographers jhould agree upon the mofb

cf Perfons and Places, or clip them, or flretch them to
what they are pleafed to call their own Standard, which
if they did not, we Jhould always know whereabouts we
are, and who is meant. If a little Care were taken y
and Men wrote rather to inflruB and inform, than to
raife themfelves a Name, which when their Works come
to be ftriBly examined they mufl infallibly lofe ; we jhould

World would not be peflered with the offenfive Lumber of

One of thefe Iilands is called Ramni y and

If he has killed two, he claims two Wives,
and fo on in proportion • fo that if he has
flain fifty, he may marry fifty Wives. This
Cuftom proceeds from the Number of ho-
itile Nations which furround them ; fo that
he,among them,who kills the greateit Num-
ber, is the moft confidered.

Thefe Iflands of Ramni abound with
Elephants, Red-wood, and Trees called
Chairzan^ and the Inhabitants eat Human
People that Flefh. Thefe Iflands part the Sea of Har-
eat Human kand from the Sea of Sbcla bct^ and beyond
Fle fe' them are others called Najabaliis, which
are pretty well peopled. Both the Men
and the Women there go quite naked, ex-
cept that the Women conceal their Parts
with the Leaves of Trees. When Shipping
is among thefe Iflands, the Inhabitants
come on in Embarkations, little and big,
Amber- and bring with them Ambergreefe, and
greefe. Coco-nuts, which they truck for Iron :
For they want no Cloathing, being free
from the extremes either of Heat or ol Cold.
"TheSea of Beyond thefe two Iflands lies the Sea of
Andaman. Andaman ; the People on this Coaft eat
Canibah. Human Flefn quite raw ; their Complexion
is black* their Hair friz-led; their Coun-
tenance and Eyes frightful ; their Feet are
very large and almoft a Cubit in length ;
and they go quite naked. They have no
Embarkations ; if they had, they would
devour all the Paflengers they could lay
Hands on. When Ships have been kept
back by contrary Winds, they are often,
in thefe Seas, obliged to drop Anchor, on
this barbarous CoafL for the fake of Wa-

ter,when they have expended their Stock;
and upon thefe Occaiions they often lofe
fome of their Men, but moll efcape.

Beyond this there is a mountainous |/j
and inhabited Ifland, where, as they fay, ^ n un ~ ir _
are Mines of Silver; but as it does not i^d^vdre
ly in the ufual Track of Shipping, many are Mines
have fought for it in vain ; tho' remarka- ofSifoer*
ble for a very lofty Mountain, which is
called Kajbenai. It happened that a Ship
failing in this Latitude, had Sight of the
Mountain, and fhaped her Courfe for it;
and being come up with the Land, fent a
Boat on ihore, with Hands to cut Wood.
The -Men kindled a Fire, and faw Silver
run from it ; which gave them to under-
ftand there was a Mine of this Metal in
that Place; wherefore they ihipped as-
much of the Earth, or Ore, as they faw
good. But as they were proceeding on
their Voyage, the Sea was ruffled by fo
furious a Guft of Wind, that, to lighten
their Ship, they were under a neceffity of
throwing all their Ore overboard. Since
that time the Mountain has been carefully
looked for, but it has never lince been feen.
To conclude, there are many fuch Iflands
in the Sea, more in Number than can be
faid ; being partly too dangerous to be ap-
proached by Seamen, and partly unknown
to them.

again, and diicharges itfelf in a prodi-

then alfo is it that Fifh, of all lizes, are
thrown dead afhore upon the Rocks, like
an Arrow from a Bow.

The Wind which commonly blows up-
on the Sea of Harkand y is from another
Quarter, it coming from the North-weft;
but this Sea is alfo Subject to as violent
Agitations as thofe we have juft men-
tioned. And now is Ambergreefe torn
up from the Bottom, and particularly where
it is very deep } and the deeper it is, the
more exquifite is the Amber. It is ob-
ferved that when this Sea rages in this

where alio they Ship their Goods w r hich
come from Bafra or Baffora, Oman, and
other Parts ; and this they do, becaufe in
this Sea, (that is, in the Sea of Perfea
and the Red Sea) there are frequent Storms,
and fhole Water in many Places. From
Bafra to Sir af is 120 Leagues, and when
Ships have loaded at this laft Place, they
there water alfo ; and from thence make
Geog-Nub. ^ail f- ot a Pl ace called Mafcat, which is in

about 200 Leagues from Sir of. On the Eaft
Coaft of this Sea, between Siraf and Maf-

and an Iiland called Ebn Kahowan ; and
in this Sea are Rocks called Oman, and
a narrow Strait, called Dordur, between two
Rocks, through which fmall VerTels do
venture, but the Chinefe Ships dare not.

and in like manner they truck the little
Amber which is thrown on their Coaft,
for bits of Iron. The Bargain is driven

by Signs, and Touches of the Hand, be-
caufe they underitand not the Arabefque :
But they are very fharp, and are apt to
carry off Iron trom the Merchants, and

Calabar. From this Place Ships fleer towards Ca-
labar, the Name of a Place and a King-
dom on the Coaft,to the right Hand be-
yond India* Bar lignifies a Coaft in the
Language of the Country, and this de-

Inhabitants are dreiled in thofe forts of
ft-riped Garments, which the Arabs call
Fauta, and they commonly wear but one
at a time, which is equally obferved by
Perfons of high Rank, and thole of in-
ferior Degree. At this Place they com-
monly take in Water, which is filled from
3ivingWells,and which they like better than
what is drawn out of Citterns and Tanks.
Calabar is about a Months Voyage from
a Place called Kaukam, which is almoft
upon the Skirts of the Sea of Harkand,
[Ml * n ten Days after this, Ships reach a

Betuma. Place called Betmna, where they may wa-
ter if they pleafe. From thence in ten
Days they come up with Kadrange, where
alfo they may water. It is worth the notice,
that in * all the Iflands and Peninfula's of
the Indies, they find Water when they dig
for it.

Senef. In this laft mentioned Place there is a

very lofty Mountain, which is lcarce Peo-
pled by any but Slaves and fugitive Rob-
bers. From thence in ten Days they ar-

where is frelh Water. Then they fleer
upon the Sea of Sanji, and fo to the
Gates of China ; for fo they call certain
Rocks and Sholes in that Sea, between
which is a narrow Strait, through which
Sips pafs. It requires a Month to Sail
from Sandarfulat to China, and it takes up
eight whole Days to iteer clear of thefe
Rocks. When a Ship has got through
thefe Gates, ihe, with the Tide of Flood,
goes into a frefh Water Gulf, and drops
Anchor in the chief Port of China, which
is that of Canfu ', and here they have frefh Canfu.

Winter and Summer; and this kind oivefedrefi
drefs is common to the Prince, the Sol-**^*-
dier, and to every other Perfpn, though
of the lower! Degree. In Winter they
wear Drawers, of a particular make, which
fall down to their Feet. Of thefe they put
on two, three, four, five or more, if they
can, one over another ; and are very careiul
to be covered quite down to their FQQt y
becaufe of the Damps which are very great,,,
and much dreaded by them. In Summer
they only wear a fingle Garment, 'of Silk,

Their commun Food is Rice, which Their com
they often eat with a Broth like what/»*»*W#
the Arabs make of Meat, or Fifh, which Rtc * m

eat Wheaten Bread, and all forts of A-

Some Particulars relating to the Indies and
to the Kings of the fame Countries.

TR1 Both the Indians and Chinefe agree, that
fj^^ there are four great or principal Kings
Kings. in the World ; they allow the King of
the Arabs to be the firft, and to be, with-
out difpute, the moft Powerful of Kings,
the moft wealthy, and the moft excellent
every way • becaufe he is the Prince and
Head of a great Religion, and becaufe no
other furpaiies him in Greatnefs,or Power.
The Emperor of China reckons himfelf
next after the King of the Arabs, and
after him the King of the Greeks ^ and
TheBal- laftly, the Balhara, King of Moharmi al

Adan, or of Thofe who have their Ears
bored. This Balhara is the moft illuftrious
Prince in all the Indies ; and all the other
Kings there, tho' each is Mailer and in-
dependant in his Kingdom, acknowledge
in him this Prerogative and Pre-emi-
nence. When he fends Ambafladors to
them, they receive them with extraordi-
nary honours, becaufe of the refpect they
bear him. This King makes magnificent
Prefents after the manner of the Arabs ;
and has Horfes and Elephants in very
great Number, and great Treafures in Mo-
ney. He has of thole Pieces of Silver cal-
led Thartarian Drams, which weigh half
a Dram more than the Arabefque Dram.
They are coined with the Die of the
Prince,and bear the Year of his Reign from
the Jaft of the Reign of his Predeceflbr.
They compute not their Years from the
Mid. of Mohammed as do the Arabs, but
only by the Years of their Kings. Moft
of thefe Princes have lived a long time, and
many of them have reigned above Fifty
Years * and thofe of the Country believe
that the length of their Lives, and of
their Reigns, is granted them in recom-
pence for their Kindnefs to the Arabs. In
truth, there are no Princes more heartily
affectionate to the Arabs ; and their Sub-
jects profefs the fame Friendfliip for us. ^

manner, that no where elfe are the like to be
feen. Thefe Garments are for the moll part
round, and wove to that degree of finenefs,
that they may be drawn through a Ring
of a middling Size.

Shells are current in this Country, and «
ferve for fmallMoney,notwithftanding thas
they have Gold and Silver, Wood-Aloes,
and Sable-Skins of which they make the
Furniture of Saddles and Houilngs. In
this fame Country is the famous Karkandan
or Uhi com jY/ho has but one Horn upon his
Forehead, and thereon a round Spot with
the Reprefentation of a Man. The whole
Horn is black, except the Spot in the mid-
dle, which is white. The Unicorn is much qfa Un&i
fmaller than the Elephant • from the Neck corn,
downwards he pretty much refembles the
Bufflar} for Strength he is extraordinary,
therein furpaffing ail other Creatures; his
Hoof is not cloven ; and from his Foot to
his Shoulder he is all of a Piece. The Ele-
phant flies from the Unicorn, whofe low-

xng is like that of an Ox, with fomething
of the Cry of a Camel. His Fleih is not
forbidden, and we have eaten of it. There
are great Numbers of this Creature in the
Fens of this Kingdom, as alfo in all the
other Provinces of the Indies ; but the Horns
of thefe are the moft efteemed, and upon
them are generally feen the Figures of
Men, Peacocks, Fifties, and other Refem-
blances. The Cbinefe adorn their Girdles
with thefe forts of Figures; fo that fome of
thefe Girdles are worth two or three thou-
fand pieces of Gold in Cbina y and fome-
times more, the Price augmenting with the
Beauty of the Figure. All the things, we
have here enumerated, are to be purchafed
in the Kingdom of Rabmi for Shells, which
are the current Money.

K&fchl\ru After this Kingdom there is another
which is an inland State, diftant from the
Coait, and calFd Kafcbbin. The Inhabi-
tants are white, and bore their Ears : They
have Camels, and their Country is a Defart,
and full of Mountains.

Hitrange. Farther on, upon the Coaft, there is a
fmall Kingdom called Hitrange y which is
very poor ; but it has a Bay, where the Sea
throws up great Lumps of Ambergreefe.
They have alfo Elephants Teeth and Pep-
per : but the Inhabitants eat it green, be-
cause of the fmallnefs of the Quantity they
gather.

Jtfujet. Beyond thele Kingdoms, here mention-

ed, there are others of number unknown,
and among the reit that of Majet. The In-
habitant*

habitants are white, and drefs after the
Chincfe Mode: Their Country is full of
Mountains with white Tops and of very-
great Extent. Here are great Quantities
of Musk, eiteemed the moft exquiiite iri
the World. They have War with all the
neighbouring Kingdoms. The Kingdom
of Mabed is beyond that of Mitj'et ; therein MabecL;
are many Cities, and the Inhabitants have
a great Refemblance of the Chinefe, evert,
more than thofe of Mitjet ; for they have
Officers or Eunuchs like thofe who govern
the Cities among the Chinefe. The Coun-
try of Mabed is conterminous with China,
and is at peace with the Emperor of 'China,
but is riot fubjeft to him.

The Mabed fend every Year AmbafTadors <£h e jyf 2 ^
and Prefents to the Emperor oi China, who bed fend
on his part fends AmbafTadors and Prefents <d™bajfa^
to them. Their Country is of great Ex- ^hina
tent • and when the AmbafTadors of the Ma-
ted enter China, they are carefully watch-
ed, and never once allow 'd to furvey the
Country, for fear they mould form Deiigns
of conquering it, which would be no diffi-
cult Task for them* becaufe of their great
Numbers, and becaufe they aire parted xrorri
China, only by Mountains, or by Rocks.

They fay, that in the Kingdom of 'China tfUNum*
there are above two hundred Cities which farofCitks
have Jurisdiction over feveral others, and 7?2Chlna '
have each a Prince or Governor, and an
Eunuch or Lieutenant. Canfu is one of
thefe Cities, being the Port for all Ship-

thefe Trumpets, which the Chinefe found at
certain Hours of the Day and of the Night.

which they beat at the lame time ; <ind this
they do as a public Token of their Obedi-

Hour of the Day and of the Night ; to which
end they have alfo Dials and Clocks with
Weights.

Copper Mo- They coin a great deal of Copper Mo-

m >'' ney like what the Arabs know by the

Name of Falas. They have Treafures like
other Kings; but no others have this fort
of fmall Money, which, and no other, is
current all over the Country: For tho*
they have Gold, Silver, Pearls, Silk, and
rich Stuffs in great abundance, they confi-
der them only as Moveables and Merchan-
dize, and the Copper Pieces are the only
current Coin. From foreign Parts they
have Ivory, Frankincenfe, Copper in Pigs,
Tortoife Shell, and the Unicorns Horns
which we have mention'd, and with which
they adorn their Girdles. Of their own

laft Merchantman be arrived. Then they
take three in ten, or thirty per Cent, of
each Commodity, and return the reft to
the Merchant. If the Emperor wants any
particular thing, his Officers have a right to
take it preferably to any other Perfons
whatsoever ; and paying for it to the utmoft
Penny it is valued at, they difpatch this
Buiinefs immediately, and without the leaft
Injuftice. They commonly take Camphire,
which they pay for after the rate of fifty
Fakuges per Man^ and the Fakuge is worth
a thoufand Falus or Pieces of Copper,
When it happens that the Emperor does
not take Camphire, it fells for half as
much again. *

There is alfo a fupreme Judge, and him

No one is raifed to the Dignity of a Governors
Prince or Governor of a City, till he cf Cities.
has attained his fortieth Year, For then^
(ay they, he hath Experience. When one
of thefe Princes or petty Kings, keeps
his Court in a City, he is feated upon a
Tribunal, and receives the Petitions or
Complaints of the People. Behind his Tri-
bunal, is an Officer called Lieu, who keeps
Handing, and, according to the Order he
receives from the Prince, commits his An-
fwer to Writing ; for they never anfwer by
Word of Mouth to any Bulinefs whatfo-
ever, nor will they give any Anfwer at all
to any thing that is not written. Before
the Parties prefent their Petitions to the
Prince, they get them examined by an
Officer, who, ■ if he difcovers any Fault,
fends them back again. For no Man may
draw up thefe Writings which are to be
prefented to the Prince, except a Clerk
verfed in Bulinefs, and at the Bottom of

'$ojh6 They have no Import, upon their Lands,

is levied upon Men only, and that, accords

any Arabs, or other Strangers are in this
Country, the Cbinefe tax them in propor-
tion to their Subftance, When any Dearth
makes NecefFaries very dear, then does
the King open his Storehoufes, and fell all
Sorts of Provifions much cheaper than
they are to be had at Market ; and hence
no Dearth is of any long Continuance a-

Sab, and it is a Shrub more buihy than the
Pomegranate-tree, and of a more taking
Smell, but it has a kind of Bitternefs with

cures all forts of Difeafes. Whatever Sums

that People may get at it. When the
String is pulled, the Bell ffcrikes over the

mands, that the Perfon, who thus demands
Juftice , be brought before him ; and accor-
dingly the Complainant fets forth his Cafe

If a Man would travel from one Place to p a fles/w

nor's Pafs permits him to fet out on his
Journey, and takes notice of the Name of
the Traveller, and of thofe alfo of his
Company,, the Age and Family of the one
and the other : For every body in China ,
whether a Native, or an Arab, or any o-
ther Foreigner, is obliged to declare all he
knows of himfelf, npr can he poffibly be
excufed the fo doing. The Eunuch's or
Lieutenant's Pafs fpecifies the Quantities of
Money or Goods which the Traveller and
thofe with him, take along with them. And
this is done for the lntbrmation of the
Frontier places, where thefe two Pafles are
examined ; for whenever a Traveller ar-
rives at any of them, it is regiflered, 'That
fuch a one j the Son offuch a one, of finch a
Family, paffed through this Place on fuch a
Day, in fuch a Month, in fuch a Tear, and
in fuch Company. And by this means they
prevent any one from carrying off the Mo-
ney or Effects of other Perfons, or their
being loft : So that if any thing has been
carried off unjuftly, or the Traveller dies
on the Road, they immediately know what
is become of the Things, and they are ei-
ther reftored to the Claimant, or to the
Heirs.
'Jdmmi- The Chine fe adminifter Juftice with great
f ration of Strictnefs in all their Tribunals. When
Jupce, an y p er f on enters his Action againft ano-

and the Defendant writes down his De-
fence, which he iigns, and holds between
This Fingers. Thefe two writings are de-

livered in together, and being examined,
Sentence is pronounced in writing, and
the Parties have each his Paper returned to
him • but firft they give back to the Defen-
dant his writing of Defence, that he may-
acknowledge it. When one Party denies
what the other affirms, he is ordered to re-
turn his Writing ; and if the Defendant
thinks he may do it fafely,and according-
ly delivers in his Paper again, they alio
call for that of the Plaintif, and then they
fay to him who denies what the other
feems to have reafon to maintain, Exhibit
a Writing whereby to make it appear that your
Antagmift has no right to demand ofyou-.what
is in debate ; but if it clearly betrays the Truth
cf what you deny^you /hall undergo twenty Strokes
of the Bamboo upon the Backfide^ and pay a Fine
of twenty Fakuges, which make about two
hundred Dinars. Now this Punifhment is
fuch as the Criminal could notfurvive: It
is fo grievous that no Perfon in all China y
may, of his own Authority, inflict it upon
another, upon pain of Death, and Confis-
cation of goods And fo no Body is ever
fo hardy as to expofe himfelf to {o certain

Subftance of private Perfons into his Hands,
and embezzle it ; and that he ought not

by ftripping them of their Property. But
after all, it they cannot difcover him to

Family, revolted lome Time ago. This * n China.
Man's Name was Baichu, and he began
with Hoftilities in the Country, march-
ing his Arms into many Places to the
great Lofs of the Inhabitants, till win-
ning a Party over to him by his Libera-
lities, he got together a Multitude of Va-
fabonds and abandoned People, whom
e formed into a confiderable Body of
Troops. His Hands thus strengthened,
and himfelf in a Condition to undertake
any Thing, he betrayed his Deiign of
fubduing the Empire to himfelf, and
ftrait marched to Canfu, one of the moft
noted Cities in China, and, at that Time,
the Port for ^11 the Arabian Merchants.
This City ftands upon a great River, fome

ved to befiege the Place, and the Siege
lafted a great while. This was tranfac-

the Chinefe are extremely nice in the Ac-
counts they keep of them. He alio cut
down the Mulberry Trees, and almoft
all the Trees of other Kinds; but we
fpeak of the Mulberry in particular, be-
caufe the Chinefe carefully cultivate it for
the fake of its LeafJ wherewith they

This Devaluation is the Caufe why Silk

Seat, making a confined Retreat to
the City of Hamdu, on the Frontiers to-
wards the Province of Tibet. Mean while

volutions and of the total Ruin of Chi*
na y which Hill continues.

Thus were Affairs, and the Rebel v'heKhg
flood uncontroled by any Difadvantage of TagaV
that might take away from his Power g az - *##*
and Authority. At 1 aft the Emperor of tbe ^r
China wrote to the King of Tagazgaz, m^/ ,
^Turkeftauj which whom, belides the near-
nefs of his Dominions, he was in fome
degree allyed by Marriage; and at the
fame Time fent an Embafly to him to
implore his Deliverance from this Rebel.
Upon this the King of Tagazgazdifyatched
his Son, at the Head of a very nume-
rous Army, to fight the Rebel ; and af-
ter many Battles, and almoft continual
Skirmifhes, he utterly defeated him. It
was never known what became of the Re-
bel. Some believe he fell in Battle, while
others think he ended his Days another
way.

The Emperor of China returned then <ffeEmpe-
to Cumdan ; and altho* he was extremely *w returns
weakned, and almoft difpirited becaule ^Cumdan
of the Embezzlement of his Treafures,
and the Lofs of his Captains and beft
Troops, and becaufe of all the late Ca-
lamities j he neverthelefs made himfelf
Mafter of all the Provinces which had
been conquered from him. However
he laid no Hands on the Goods of his
Subjects, but fatisfied himfelf with what
remained in his Coffers, and the Frag-?

ments of the Public Money. His Con-
dition indifpenilbly obliged him to take
up with what his Subjects would give
him, and to require nothing from them
but Obedience to his Mandates, forbear-
ing to fqueeze Money from them, be-
caufe the Kings or Governors had made
away with it,

felves into fo many Kings. For now
each of thefe Cbinefe Princes joined with
fome other to wage War upon a third,
without confulting the Emperor; and
when the ftrongeii had fubdued the wea-
ker!, and become Mailer of his Province,
all was wafted, and unmercifully plun-
dered, and the Subjects of the vanquiihed
Prince were unnaturally devoured; a Cru-
elty allowed by the Laws of their Re-
ligion, which even permit human Flefh
to be expofed to Sale in the public Mar-

and behaved towards them in a Method of
Procedure quite contrary to the ancient
Ufages. And for thefe Things has God
puniihed them by withdrawing his Blef-
lings from upon them in every Refpect,
and particularly by caurlng the Naviga-
tion to be fbrfaken, and the Merchants
to return in Crouds to Siraf and Oman y

The Author, in his Book, notes fome <fu p^
Cuttoms and Laws of the Chinefe^ but ijbmm*f
mentions not the Punifhment infli&ed on -Adultery^
married Perfons, when conviaed of A- %f^%
dultery. This Crime, as well as Homicide, *
and Theft is puniihed with Death, and
they execute the Criminal in this Man-
ner : They bind both the Hands together,
and then force them backwards over the
Head till they reft upon the Neck ; they
then fatten the right Foot to the right
Hand, and the left Foot to the left Hand ;
fo that both Hands and Feet are ftrongly
bound behind the Back, and thus bundled
up it is impoflible for the Criminal to ftir,
nor wants he any Body to hold him.
This Torture disjoints the Neck, makes
the Vertebrae ftart from their Connections,
and dillocates the Thighs; in fhort, the
Party is in fo miferable a Condition,
that were he to continue therein but for
a few Hours, there would be no need
of any Thing elfe to make an End of
him. But when they have bound him,
as we have faid, they ftrike him with a

upon the like Occafions, and which alone
were fufficient to kill the Criminal. With:

Gafp of Life, and forfake the Body to

Puhlic There are Women in China who re-

Women* fufe to marry, and chufe rather a diflb-
lute Life, and perpetual Debauchery. The
Cuftom is, for thefe Women to preienc
themf elves in full Audience before the
commanding Officer of the Garrifon in
the City, and declare their Averfion to
Marriage, and their Deiire to be num-
bered with the public Women. They then
deiire to be regiftred in the ufual Fon%
among thefe Prortitutes, and the Form
is fuch : They write down the Name of
the Woman, her Family, the Number of
her Jewels, the feveral Items of her At-
tire, and the Place of her Abode } thus is
ihe admitted a public Woman. After this
they put about her Neck a String, at
which hangs a Copper Ring, with the
King's Signet; and deliver to her a Wri-
ting, which certifies that ihe is received
into the Lift of common Prortitutes, and
intitles her to a yearly Stipend of
fo many Fahts to be paid her out of the
public Treafury, and threatens with Death
the Perfon who mould take her to Wife*

thefe Women; and turn off thofe who are
too barren of Charms. In the Evening
thefe Women walk abroad in D reffes of
different Colours, without any Veil, and
proftitutethemfelvesto all new comers that
loved Debauchery; but the Chinefe them-
felves fend for them to their Houfes,
whence they depart not till the next Mor-
ning, Praifed be God, who hath refcued
us from the like Infamy !

The Chinefe coin no Money belides the Copper
little Pieces of Copper, like thofe we call M <>wy.
FaluSj nor will they allow Gold or Silver to
be wrought into Specie, like the Dinars and
Drams that are current with us. For, fay
they, if a Thief goes, with an evil In-
tent, into the Houie of an Arabj where is
Gold and Silver Coin, he may carry off
ten thoufand Pieces of Gold, and al-moft
as many Pieces of Silver, and not be
much burdened therewith, and fo be the
ruin of the Man who ihould fuffer this Lofs;
whereas if a Thief has the fame Deiigii
upon theHoufe of a Chinefe Artificer, he can-
not ,at moft, take away above ten thoufand
Falus or Pieces of Copper, which do not
make ten Miticals or Dinars of Gold. Thefe
Pieces of Copper are allayed with fomething
of a different kind, and are of the Size
of a Dram, or Piece of Siver called Bagliy
and in the middle they have a pretty large
Hole to firing them by. A thoufand of
them are worth a Mitical of Gold, or a
Dinar ; and they firing them by thoufands,

who have fent them as a Prefent to the
Emperor. Thefe Officers are at the head

It is cuftomary for them, as well as the fkehfo-
Kings or Governors of all the Cities, to lem »^W-
appear abroad, rrom time to time, in io- t fcQ t i eu
lemn Proceflion. At thefe times they are
preceded by Men who carry great Pieces
of Wood, like thofe the Chriftians, of the
Levant, ufe inftead of Bells. The Noife
they make is heard afar off, and as foon
as it is heard, no Man ftands in the way
of the Eunuch, or Prince. If a Man is
at his Door, he goes into his Houfe, and
keeps his Door fhut, till the Prince, or Eu-
nuch of the City is gone by. So no Soul
is to be feen in the way; and this is in-
joined that they may be held in the greater
Veneration, to ftrike a Dread, that the
People may not fee them often, and that
they may not grow fo familiar as to fpeak
to them.

The Eunuch or Lieutenant, and the ^ eh
principal Officers wear very magnificent ® re f s '
Silk Drefles, of fo fine a kind, tfrat none
thereof is brought into the Country Sub-
ject to the Arabs, the Cbinefe keep it up at
fo high a rate* One of the chief Mer-
chants, whofe words cannot be called
in queftion, relates that he waited on an
Eunuch, whom the Emperor had fent to
Canfuy in order to purchafe fome things
he wanted from among the goods that are
carried thither from the Country of the
Arabs : And that upon his Breaft he per-
ceived a ihort Veft, which was under ano-
ther filk Veil, and which feemed to be even
between two other Veils of the fame kind}

that the Eunuch obferving him to look
ftedfaftly upon his Breaft, faid, I fee you
keep your Eyes fixed upon my Stomach } what
may be the meaning of it? The Mer-
chant anfwered; lamfurprifed at the Beau~
ty of that little Vefi^ which appears under your
other Garments. The Eunuch laughed and
held out his Shirt Sleeve to him, County
fays he, how many Vejls I have above it.
He did fo, and counted five, one upon ano-
ther, and the Waftecoat or fliort Veil was
underneath. Thefe Garments are wove
with raw Silk which has never been wafh-
ed nor fulled • and what is worn by the
Princes or Governors is Hill more rich,
and more exquifitely wrought.
n&ntert The Chinefe furpafs all Nations in every
^ r t}fi s kind of Art, and particularly in Painting;
*# j, and, with their Hands, they perform fuch

perfect Works as others can but faintly
imitate. When an Artificer has finifhed a
fine Piece, he carries it to the Prince's Pa-
lace to demand the Reward, he thinks he
deferves for the beauty of his Performance;
and the Cuftom is for the Prince to order
him to leave his Work at the Palace Gate,
where it muft Hand a whole Year. If du-
ring that time no Perfon finds a Fault in
it, the Artificer is rewarded, and admitted
into the body of Artifts } but if the leaft
Fault he found, it is rejected, and the
Workman is fent away empty. It happen-
ed once, that one of their Painters drew
f an Ear of Corn, with a Bird perched on it,

upon a piece of Silk; and his Performance

/Was fo exceeding fine, that all who be-
held it were ailoniihed thereat. This
Piece flood expofed to public View, till,
one Day, a crooked Fellow, palling by the
Palace, found Fault with the Picture, and
was immediately conducted to the Prince
or Governor of the City, who at the fame
time fent for the Painter. Then he asked
this crooked Fellow what Fault he had to
find with this piece of Paint; to which
he aniwered, Every body knows that a Bird
never fettles upon an Ear of Corn but it bends
under him ; and here this "Painter has reprefen-
ted his Ear bolt upright y though he has perched
a Bird upon it 7 and this is the Fault I have
to find. This was pronounced a very juffc
Obfervation, and the Prince bellowed no
Reward upon the Artift They pretend
by this, and other means, to ftirnulate
their Workmen to the Attainment of Per-
fection, by thus engaging them to be ex-
tremely nice and circumfpecl: in what they
undertake, and to apply their whole Mind
to what is to go out of their Hands.

There was formerly a Man of the Tribe tfheStcvi'
of Koreifi r whole Name was Ebn Wahab y of anKub
defcended of Hebar the Son of Al Afud, ™ ho lWent
and he dwelt at Bafa. This Man left '" c hlna '=
Bafra, when that City was facked, and
came to Sir of, where he faw a Ship rea-
dy to make foil for China. The mind
took him to go on board of this Ship, and
in her he went to China y where in the
Sequel he had the Curioiity to travel to
the Emperor's Court; and leaving Canfu

he reached Cumdan after a Journey of two
Months. He ftaid a long Time at the
Emperor's Court, and prefented feveral Pe-
titions, wherein he iignified that he was
of the Family of the Prophet of the A"
vabs. Having waited a considerable while,
the Emperor at laft ordered him to be
lodged in a Houfe, appointed for him, and
to be fupplied with every thing he mould
want. This done, the Emperor wrote to
the Governor of Canfu^ commanding him
carefully to inform himfelf, among the
Merchants, concerning the Relation this
Man pretended to bear to the Prophet
of the Arabs : And the Governor, by his
Anfwers, confirming the Truth of what
he had laid, touching his Extraction, the
Emperor gave him Audience , and made
him rich Prefents, wherewith he retur-
ned to Irak.

courfewith advanced in Years, but had his Senfes

Atabs.* ror asked him many Queftions about the
Arabs, and particularly how they had de-
ftroyed the Kingdom of the Per/tans. Ebn
Wahab made anlwer, that they did it by
the AfMance of God, and becaufe the
Per/tans were involved in Idolatry, ado-
ring the Stars, the Sun, and Moon, in-
stead of worfhipping the true God. To
this the Emperor replied, that the Arabs
had conquered the moft illuftrious King-
dom of the whole Earth, the beft culti-
vated,

Tated, the moft opulent, the moll preg-
nant of fine Wits, and of the moft ex-
teniive Fame. Then faid he, What Ac-
count do the People in your Parts make of
the other Kings of the Earth? To which the
Arab replied, that he knew them not.
Then faid the Emperor to the Interpreter,
Tell him we efleem but five Kings ; that he
whofe Kingdom is of widefi Extent is the
fame who is Mafter of Irak, for he is in the
midfi of the World, and furrounded by the
Territories of other Kings', and we find he
is called the King of Kings. After him we
reckon our Emperor, here prefent, and we
find that he is ftiled the King of Man-
kind*, for no other King is inverted with
a more abfolute Power and Authority over
his Subjects, nor is there a People, under
the Sun, more dutiful and fubmiffive to
their Sovereign than the People of this
Country • we therefore, in this refpeft, are
the Kings of Men. After us is the King
of the Turks, whofe Kingdom borders up-
on us, and him we call the King of Li-
ons. Next, the King of Elephants, the
fame is the King of the Indies, whom we
alfo call the King of lYifdom; becaufe he
derives his Origin from the Indians. And,
laft of all, the King of Greece, whom we
ftile the King of Men*, for, upon the face
of the whole Earth, there are no Men of
better Manners, nor of comlier Prefence
than his Subjects: Thefe, added he, are
the moft illuftrious of all Kings, nor are

Images of the Prophets, whereat I mov-
ed my Lips, praying to my felf in honour
of their Memory. The Emperor did not
imagin I iTiould know them again, and
faid to the Interpreter, Ask him why he
moves his Lips ? I anfwered, I was pray-
ing in Memory of the Prophets. How do
you know them? Said the Emperor. I re-
plied, that I knew them by the Repre-

what was written in great Characters un-

that fome were for fix Thoufand Years;
that others would not allow fo many j

out into a Laughter, and the Emperor made
many Objections to what I had advanced.

Then he ordered the Interpreter to
fpeak to me in the following ftrain : 'Take

the Emperor to underhand that there are y a-

a grateful Declaration of the kind Ufage,
and the Benefactions I there met with;
which feemed to pleafe him very much.
He then made me rich Prefents, and or-
dered that I mould be conducted to Corfu
upon Poll Horfes. He wrote alfo to the
Governor of the City, commanding him to
treat me with much Honour, and to furniih
me with the like Recommendations to the
other Governors of the Provinces, that they
might entertain me till the Time of my
Departure. Thus was I treated every where,
being plentifully fupplied with all the Ne-
ceflaries of Life, and honoured with many
Prefents till the Time of my Departure
from China.

concerning the City of Cumdauj where the
Emperor keeps his Court. He told us that
the Ci ty was very large, and extremely po-
pulous} that it was divided into two great
Parts, by a very long and very broad
Street ; that the Emperor, his chief Mini-
fters, the Soldiery, the fupreme Judge, the
Eunuchs, and all belonging to the impe-
rial Houfehold, lived in that Part of the
City which is on the right hand Earl ward;
that the People had no manner of Commu-
nication with them; and that they were
not admitted into Places watered by Ca-
nals, from different Rivers, whofe Bor-
ders were planted with Trees, and ador-
ned with magnificent Dwellings. The

where are alfo great Squares, and Mar-
kets for all the Necefiaries of Life. At
break of Day you fee the Officers of the
King's Houfehold, with the inferior Ser-
vants, the Purveyors, and the Domeilics
of the Grandees of the Court, who come,
fome on foot others on Horieback, into
that Diviiion of the City, where are the
public Markets, and the Habitations of
the Merchants; where they buy^ whate-
ver they want, and return not again to the
fame Place till the next Morning.

This fame Traveller related that this Ci-
ty has a verypleafant Situation, in themidft
of a moft fertile Soil, watered by feveral
Rivers. Scarce any Thing is wanted, ex-
cept Palm-Trees, which grow not there.

In our Times, Difcovery has been made €> ommu nU
of a Thing quite new, and unknown to ^unfa
thofe who lived before us. iNo Body ima- o cean and
gined that the Sea which extends from the the Medi-
Indies to China, had any Communication twraman,
with the Sea of Syria, nor could any one
take it into his Head. Now behold "what
has come to pafs in our Days, according to
what we have heard. In the Sea of Rum,
or the Mediterranean, they found the
Wreck of an Arabian Ship which had heert
Shattered by Temper! ; for all her Men pe-
riling, and me being darned to Pieces by
the Wave, the Remains of her were driven
by Wind and Weather into the Sea o£Cho~
%ats, and from thence to the Canal of
the Mediterranean Sea, and at laft were

throws

thrown on the Shore of Syria. IPhis evin-
ces that the Sea fur rounds all the Country of
China, and of Cila, [or Si la, ] the uttermoit
Parts of Turkeftah, and die Country of the
Chozars, and that then it .enters at the
Strait till it wafhes the Shore of Syria. The
Proof of this is deduced from the Built of
the Ship we are fpeaking of; for none but
the Ships of Siraf are fo put together
that the Planks are not nailed [or bolted],
but joined together in an extraordinary
Manner as if they were fewn; whereas
the Planking of all the Ships of the Medi-
terranean Sea, and of the Coaft of Syria, is
nailed and not joined together the other way.
We have alfo heard fay, that Amber-
greefe has been found in the Sea of Syria y
which feems hard to believe, and was un-
known to former Times. If this be as is
faid, it is impoffible that Amber fhould have
been thrown up in the Sea of Syria, but by
the Sea of Aden and of Kolzum, which has
Communication with the Seas where Amber
is found. And, becaufe God hath put a Se-
peration between thefe Seas, if tnis Story
be true, it mail neceflarily have been that
this Amber was driven firft from the Indian
Sea into the others, and that, from the one ta
the other, it at laft came into the Sea oi Syria.

King Sithis Country is called Mehrage,
and they fay it is nine hundred Leagues
in Circumference, and that this King is
Mailer of many Iflands which ly round
about; thus this Kingdom is above a thou-
fand Leagues in Extent. Among thefe
Iflands there is one called Serbeza, which
is faid to be four hundred Leagues in
Circuit, and that alfo of Rahmi which
is eight hundred Leagues in Compafs, and
produces Red-wood, Camphire, and ma-
ny other Commodities. In this fame King-
dom is the Ifland of Cak, which is in the
Mid-pafiage between China and the Coun-*
try of the Arabs. This Ifland, they fay,
is fourfcore Leagues in Circumference* and
hither they bring ail Sorts of Merchan-
dife, Wood Aloes of feveral Sorts, Cam-
phi re, Sandal-wood, Ivory, the Lead call-
ed Cabahi, Ebony, Red-wood, every Kind
of Spice, and many other Things too te-
dious to enumerate. At prefent the Com-
merce is moll ufually carried on from O-
man to this Ifland, and from this Ifland to
Oman. The Mehrage is fovereign over all
thefe Iflands, and that which he makes his
Abode, is extremely fertile, and fo very
populous that the Towns almoft croud one
upon the other. A Perfon of great Pro-
bity relates, that when the Cocks here
crow at their accuftomed Hours, jufl as
with us, at roort upon Trees, they an-
fwer each other a hundred Leagues around
and morej becaufe of the Proximity of the

may Hop at every Step, and find Shelter

and if they are tired they may repofe
themfelves every Day at Noon, go which
way they will.
Partku- Now what follows, which we have from
lan of the the Teftimony of feveral Peribns, is the
Country of rnoft remarkable Particular we have heard
Zapage. concerning the Ifland of Zapage. There
was formerly a King, who was called
Mehrage. His Palace is ftill to be feen on
a River as broad as the Tygris at Bagdad
or at BaJJora. The Sea intercepts the
Courfe of its Waters, and fends them
back again with the Tide of Flood; and
during the Tide of Ebb, it ftreams out
frefh Water a good way into the Sea.
This River is let into a lmall Pond clofe
to the King's Palace, and every Mor-
ning the Officer who has Charge of his
Houfehold, brings an Ingot of Gold
wrought in a particular Manner, which is
unknown, and throws it into the Pond
in the Prefence of the King. The Tide
riflng with the Flood covers it with ma-
ny others, its fellows, and quite con-
ceals it from Sight ; but low Water
difcovers them, and they appear plain
by the Beams of the Sun. The King
comes to view them at the fame Time
that he repairs to m Apartment of State

which lggks upon this Pond. This Cuft-
om is l^y fcrupuioufly obferved, and
thus they every Day throw an Ingot
of Gold into this Pond, as long as the
King lives, nor touch the fame upon a-
ny Account. When the King dyes, his
Succeiior caufes them all to be taken out,
and not one of them is ever milled ;
They count them, and melt them down,
and this done, the Sums provening from
this great Quantity of Gold, are diftri-
buced to thofe of the Royal Houfehold,
to the Men, to the Women, and to the
Children, to the fuperior and to the in-
ferior Officers, esjch receiving a Part, in
Proportion to the Rank he bears, and ac-
cording to the Order eftablifhed, among
them, for this Diftribution * and the Sur-
plus is given away to the Poor, and to
the infirm. Then they reckon up the
Number of Ingots, and what they weigh,
and fay * Such a one reigned fo many Years,
for he left fo many Ingots of Gold in
the Pond of the Kings, and they were
diflributed, after his Death, to the People
of his Kingdom. K is a Glory, with them,
to have reigned a long while, and to have
thus multiplied the Number of thefe In-
gots, to be given away at their Death.

Their ancient Hiftory relates, that one J Story of
of the Kings of Kumar would have waged the King of
War with him of this Ifland. This Coun- ^omar
try of Komar is the fame from whence they Mchrage;

This Kingdom was at Peace with that of Ztf-
page, where reigned the Mebrage. They are
divided from each other by a PaiTage often,
or twenty Days fail, with a very eafy Gale.
They fay that in former Days there was a
young and turbulent King in this Ifland of
Kcmar. This King was one Day in his Pa-
lace, which looks upon a River much like
the Euphrates at the Entrance, and but a
Day Diftant from the Sea. His prime Mini-
ster was with him, and, in the Difcourfe they
had together, mention was made of the
Kingdom of the Mebrage and its Glory, how-
well it was peopled and cultivated, and the
Croud of Iflands which owed Obedience
thereunto. Then faid the King of Komar
to his Minifter, J am taken with a Defire,
which I moft earnefily could wijh to fee accom-
pliftjed. The Minifter, who was a wife and
a prudent Man, and no Stranger to the Le-
vity of his Mafter, addreffed him; My Lord,
what is your Deftre ? I could wifh, replied the
King, to fee before me, in a Dijb, the Head of
the Mehrage King ofZapage. The Minifter,
w ell aware it was Jealoufy that infpired him
with this Irregularity, made Aniwer, My

iffiended us either by Word or deed, and never
did us the leafi Injury. Moreover, they are in
an I /I and divided 'from us, and have no Manner
of Gmmunhdtion with our Country ; nor do
they betray any Thoughts of making a Conqacft
of this Kingdom. No one therefore ought to
hearken to filch Dfcourfe, or make one Word of
Anfwer upon this Head. The King was en-
raged at this Return,, and replyed not there-
to : -at vv ithout any Regard had to the fage
Advice of his firil Minifter, he opened the
fame Thing to the principal Officers of State,
and to allthofe of his Court that were pre-
fent.

This Matter being rumored about by fe- <f heEmi ,„
veral Perfons, became of public Notoriety, p^fe fthe
and at length reached the Ears of the Meb- Mehrage
rage. He, who then reigned, was a wife and *g?inft the
an a£tive Prince, of coniummate Experience, ^'^ ^
and as yet in the Flower of his Days. He
called for his firrt Minifter, and having ac-
quainted him with what he had heard,
faid to him ; It is by no means proper to declare
the Behavior of this giddy Prince, or to be~
tray how little we efieem him, becaufe of his
Youth and little Experience. Nor is it proper
to divulge what he has faid againfi me ;fbrfuch
Speeches, cannot but be prejudicial to the Dig-
nity of a King, make him contemptible, and take
away from his Reputation. Having thus in-
joined his Minifter to conceal what had paf-
fed between them, he, at the fame Time,
commanded him to prepare a thoufand Ships
of middling Burthen, and to equip them
with all Things necelfary, Arms and Am-
F munition.

munition, and to man them with as many
of his belt Forces as they could carry ^ then
he gave out That he would take a Voyage a-
mong the neighbouring Iflands, under his
Dominion, to divert himfelf. He wrote to
all the tributary Princes of thefe fame I-
ilands to acquaint them That he defigned
them a Vifit, to recreate himfelf in their I-
flands: And this being the public Talk, each
of thefe Kings prepared for the Reception
of the Mehrage. Mean while, when every
Thing was in readinefs as he had ordered y
he went on board his Ships, and with a
powerful Army failed over to the Kingdom
oiKomar. The King and thofe belonging
to his Court were effeminate Creatures, who,
all the Day long, did nothing but confult
their Faces and rub their Teeth, eternally
with Mirrors and Tooth-picks in their
Hands, or carried after them by Slaves. So*
the King of Komar difcovered nothing of
the Mehrage s purpofe, till he appeared in
the Mouth of the River, which was. crowned
by the Palace of the King of Komar, and
till he had landed his Troops, who imme-
diately inverted him with great vigor, and
took him. The King was taken in his Pa-
lace, and all that belonged to him fled
without fighting.

Then the Mehrage inftantly caufed Pro-
clamation to be made,That he granted entire
Security of Life and Effects to all the Inha-
bitants of the Country ; and feating him-
felf on the Throne of the King of Komar y
now a Captive, he ordered him to be

brought into his Prefence, together with his
firft Minifter. Then faid he to the King of

Komar : Who was it filled your Head with a
Proje& unequal to your Strength, and abfo-
htely impojjtble for you to compafs? What
would you have done if you had gained your
End? This Prince, who had nothing to
fay for himfelf, made no Anfwer. Then
continued the Mehrage, If you had enjoyed
the Pkafureyou wiped, of feeing my Head in ct
Dip before you, you would have [piled- my
Kingdom, and made your felf Mafter thereof
lifter you had committed all Sorts of Violence : I
will not fo behave with regard to you ; .but yet I
will execute upon you, what you wiped concern
ning me, and then will I return into my King"
dom, without touching any Thing in your Do-
minions, and wit bout carrying away ought fe-
ver of great Value or finally dejirous only that
you may be recorded an Example for the Inft ruc-
tion ofthofe who pall come after you\ that no
one may exceed the Bounds of his Power, that
each may be contented with his own, and that
thofeyou haw difturbedmaybe reft or ed to perfect
Security. This faid, he ordered them to
fmite off his Head; and then turning to the
Minifter, he faid; Ton have done all a
good Minifter could do, I know you offe-
red good Advice to your Mafter, and that he
hearkened not unto you. Cmfult who may beft
fucceed this Fool, for the good of the Kingdom^
and fet him upon the Throne : Then {trait the
Mehrage departed for his own Territories,
and neither did he, or any of his, lay Hands
on the leaft Thing in the Kingdom of Komar.
F 2 When



£t ANCIENT ACCOUNTS

When he arrived in his own Kingdom,
he fat down upon his Throne, and, be-
ing in the Place which looked upon the
Pond before-mentioned, he caufed the Head
of the King of Komar to be put into a Bafon,
and fet before him} and calling in the
Chiefs of his Kingdom, he acquainted them
with all he had done, and with the Rea-
fons which had induced him to the Expedi-
tion we have related ; And they approved the
Deed with Acclamations and Prayers for his
Profperity. Then he ordered the Head of
the King of Komar ', to be wafhed, and em-
balmed, and put into a Coffer; and fent
it back to the King Komar who had been
appointed in the Room of him he had put
to Death, at the fame time writing a Letter
to this new Prince, couched in the follow-
ing Terms ; What inclined us to do what we
did to your Predeceffor, and your Lord, was his
known Malevolence towards us, and that we
might fet an Example to his Equals. We have
leenfo happy as to treat him as he zvould have
treated us : But we think it convenient to fend
his Head back to you , having had no Dcftgnof
detaining it y or of arrogating any Glory to our
[elves from the Advantage we obtained over him.
The News of this A6tion being com eyed
to the Kings of the Indies and of China, it
added to the Refpe& they before had for
the Mehrage: And from that Time it has
been a Cuftom with the Kings of Komar y
every Morning they rife, to turn to-
wards the Country of Zapagc, and to pro-
ftrate themfelves on the Ground, and to

That one of thefe Princes being newly reco- ^f^
vered of the Small-Pox, and beholding him-
felf in a Glafs, was deeply troubled to fee
how fadly his Face was disfigured- and that
turning himfelf towards one of the Sons of
his Brother, he faid to him, Sure it never hap-
ned to any Man as to me, to remain in his
Body after fuch a Change ; but this Body is
only a Veflel puffed out with Wind, and
when the Soul leaves it, ihe migrates in-
to another • go get upon the Throne, for
I am about to feparate my Body from my
Soul, until I return in another Body. At
the fame Time he called for a fharp and
keen Cangiar^ with which he commanded
his Nephew to cut off his Head, which the
other did, and he was afterwards burnt.

China. This Man was extremely Selfifh
arid of invincible Avarice. It hapned that
the Emperor of China had fent one of his
Eunuchs to Canfit) the City for all the Ara-
bian Traders, there to purchafe what he
wanted, and was to be had on board of the
Ships that: were arrived. This Eunuch was
one of thofe who fhared the moft coniide-
rably in his Matter's good Opinion and Con-
fidence, and was Keeper of his Treafure
and of all his moll precious Things. A Dis-
pute arofe between this Eunuch and this
Merchant, about fome Pieces of Ivory and
other Goods, and it ran fo high, that the
Merchant refufed to deal with him : But
this Affair making a great Noife, the Eu-
nuch pufhed it fo far, that he forced from
him the Choice of his Goods, regardlefs of
whatever the other could fay to him.
tfhelitth The Merchant withdrawing himfelf^

be committed to Prifon, there to remain
for two whole Months, which expired, the

you appear before the Emperor, your Wrongs are
not fuch as may intitle you to have recourfe to

to the end that every Man who would prejume
to do as you have done, may be deterred from

ed and confirmed by many more, fent to
the Emperor from divers Parts, and the
Eunuch was cited to appear. No fooner
did he arrive than the Emperor feized on

Office as Treasurer, and then faid to him ;

ftrait he ordered him to be fent to the
Tombs of the Kings, to guard them, and
there to remain for Life.

One of the Things moil worthy to be ad-? &he Orde*
mired in China, before the late* Commoti- *£%£'**
ons, was the good Order they obferved in JJ fe £.
the Adminiitration of Juftice, and the Ma- h ma fa
jeity of their Tribunals. To fill them they
made Choice of fuch Men as were perfectly
verfed in their Laws, and fuch, confequent-
ly, as were never at a Stand when they were
to pafs a Judgment- Men of Sincerity, zea-
lous in the Caufe of Juftice upon every Oc-
caiion, nor to be byalled by what the Great
could oiler to embroil a Difpute^fo that Jut-'
tice was always adminifhred to him who
had Right on his fide. In a Word, they
made Choice of upright Men, of Men who
equally abftained from the ilender Sub-
ffcance of the Poor, and from the Prefents
of thofe who would have bribed them there-*
with.

When they defigned to promote any tfhePro-
Man to the Office of principal Judge, they nwtkn of a
previoufly fent him to all the chief Cities fa nmQ
of the Empire, in each of which he ftaid %* ge '
a Month or two. In the mean time it was,
his bufinefs, moil: minutely, to inquire into
the Afiairs of the People, into all that
pafied in the City, and into the various
Cuftoms. He informed himfelf of all fuch
as deferved to be believed upon their
Word of Teftimony, and this Knowledge
was of ufe to him in the Sequel, as Occaii-«
qn required. After he had gone through

all



74 ANCIENT ACCOUNTS

all the Cities, in the Manner abovefaid, and
made a Stay of fome Time in the moil: con-
siderable of them, he repaired to the impe-*
rial Court, where he was inverted with the
Dignity of fupreme Judge. To him then
the Emperor referred the Nomination of
all the other Judges, and by him were they
appointed, after he had acquainted the Em-
peror with thofe, who, in his whole Domi-
nions, were moit worthy of exerciiing Ju~
rifdi£tion, each in his own City, or in others ;
for he knew thofe who were commendable
for their Underftanding, and fo no one was
raifed , who poneffed not the fame En-
dowments, or who bore not Tertimony ac-*
cording to Truth, when he was interrogated.
The Emperor allows none of his Judges
to write to him upon any Affair, when he
is informed of the contrary, and even de-
prives them of their Office. The fupreme
Judge cauies Proclamation, every Day, to he
made before his Gate, and in his Name they
cry out, If any Man hath been wronged by
the King or Governor, who is not to be
feen of the People, or by any one of his
Relations or Officers, or by any one of the
Body of the People ; I will do him ample
Juftice, as foon as the Offender is put into
my Hands, and that I have Charge of him :
This Proclamation is thrice repeated. It
is an ancient Cuftom with them,never to de-
j grade a King or Governor of a City, but by

(virtue of Letters hTued out by the Council
or Divan of Kings: and this is commonly
executed for fome flagrant Malverfation, or
\ ' when

when Judgment is fufpended or delayed.
But when the Governor avoids theie two
Things, it is feldom he is difturbed with
Letters of Revocation, which are never
drawn up but on a lawful Account. The
Polls of Judicature are conferred on none
but Perfons of Probity and Lovers of Ju-
itice ; and fo is good order maintained in

Of Choraflan.

This Province is almoft conterminous
with China. From China to xhzSogd it is
about a two Months Journey, through im-
practicable Defarts, and through a Country
all over covered with Sand, where no Water
is to be found. It is not watered by any
Rivers, nor is there any Habitation in the
Purlieus of this Province; and for this
Reafon it is that the Choraffamans can make
no Irruptions into China. That Part of this
Empire which lies farther!: w r eftward, is the
Province of Madu, which borders upon £?- MaduJ
fret, fp that on this fide the two Nations are
at perpetual War with each other. Among
thofe of our time who have travelled into
China, we were acquainted with one who
told us he had feen a Man that had a VerTel
with Musk in it, on his Back, and had travel-
led on Foot fromS aware and to Canfu, the Port
for all Merchants from Siraf. He had, by
Land, traverfed all theCities of Chindpnt af-
ter another, which he might eafily do, be- „ ^ *
caufe the Provinces of ChimmdTifet) where Tibet

the Musk-creature is met with, are contiguous
and not divided by any Separation. The Chi-
nefe carry off as many of thefe Creatures as
they can lay Hands on, and thofe of 'Tibet , on
their Part, do the fame. But the Musk of
Tibet is far preferable to that of China for
two Reafons: Firjt in Tibet this Creature
feeds on aromatic Paftures, while in China
he has nothing to fubfirt. him but what is
common. Secondly the Tibetians preferve
their Bladders or Cods of Musk ia the pure
natural State, while the Chinefe adulterate
all that come into their Hands. They dip
them alfo into the Sea, or elfe expofe them
to the Dew, and having kept them fome
time, they take off the outward Membrane,
and then clofe them up ; and this Musk
paries in the Country of the Arabs for Musk
of Tibet) becaufe oi its Excellence.

The moft exquifite of all die Sorts of
Musk, is what the Roe-Bucks, that yield
it, leave behind them when they rub them-
felves againlt the Rocks in the Mountains •
for the Humor, whence it is generated,
falling down towards the Navel of the
Creature, it there gathers into a Quantity
of turbid Blood, jurl after the Manner of
Biles, and fuch like Tumors. When this
Swelling is ripe, the Creature, who is fen-
fible of a painful Itching, feeks out for
Stones and rubs himfelf againft the fame,
till he opens his Sore, and the Contents run
out. Now as foon as this Matter falls from
tbeCreature, it coagulates, the Wound clofes,

and



Of IND I A and CHINA, ft

and the fame Kind of Humor gathers to a
Head again as before.

In Tibet, there are Men who go in quert
of this Musk, and are very ready at know-
ing it: and having found it, they carefully
collect it, and put it up in Bladders ; and
k is carried to their Kings. This Musk
is more, exquiiite when it has, as we may
fay, ripened in the Bladder of the Crea-
ture which bears it : It furpafles all others
in goodnefs, juft as Fruit is better when it
is gathered ripe from the Tree, than when
it is pulled green.

There is ftill another way of getting Anoihet
Musk. They infnare the Creature in Toils,. Sort of
and fhoot him with Arrows: But it often Mus1 ^
happens that the Hunters cut the Tumors
of the Creature before the Musk is elabo-
rated } and in this Cafe it has, at firfc, an ill
Scent that prevails till the Matter is thick-
ened, which fometimes does not happen in a
great while, but as icon as it coagulates it
turns to Musk.

The Musk-Creature is like our Roe- MeMtuk.
Buck, his Skin and Colour the fame, with Creatfire '
flender Legs, a fplit Horn, ftrait, but fome-
what bending withal. On each fide, he has
two fmall white Teeth, which are ftrait, and
rife above his Muzzle, each half a Finger,
or fomewhat lefs, in length, and in turn
not unlike the Teeth of the Elephant ; and
this is the diftinguiihing Mark between thefe The Em*
Creatures and other Roe-Bucks. prcr of

ded Canes, a Cubit long, which are bored

Pains in the Kidneys, the Strangury and-
Stone, are cauled by making Water in a lit-
ting Pofhire ; and that the Reins cannot free
themfelves of thofe Humors but by ftanding
to evacuate, and that thus this Porlure con-
tributes to the Prefervation of Health*

Some Particulars concerning the Indies.

In the Kingdom of the Balhara, and in all [ A A ]
the other Kingdoms of the Indies y there are Indians
Perfons who burn themfelves. This Cut* % a *J?™ s
torn proceeds from their Notion of a Me-
templycholis or Tranfmigration, which they
firmly believe as a Truth never to be called
in Queftion among them.

There are Kings who- upon their Accef- r 7 1
lion obfervethe following Ceremony. They L ^ J
drefs a great Quantity of Rice, and pour it
out upon Leaves oi the Moajk, in Sight of
the King. Then three or. four Hundred
Perfons come of their own accord, without
the leait Conftraint on the part of the
King, and prefent themfelves before him.
After he has eaten fome of this Rice, he
gives a little of it to each of them, as
fait, as they come up to him, one after a-
nother, and they eat it in his Prefence.
By eating of this Rice they all engage to
burn themfelves on the Day the King dyes^
or is flain, and they punctually fulfil,
their Promife, throwing themfelves into the'

Fire

Fire till the very laft, fo that not one Soul

of them is left behind,
f AA] When a Man is determined to burn him-*
<fheir feli> he firfb goes to the King's Palace to
Mannfr of ask leave fo to do ; and having obtained it,
burning h e goes round the public Squares of the City,
mmfefoesi anc ^ ma k es hi s wa y t0 t h e p] ace where the

Pile is heaped up with Store of dry Wood 5
while round about it Hand many Ferfons who
feed the Fire, fo that it is very violent and
blaxes prodigioully. At laft the Perfon comes
preceded by a Number of Mufical Intern-
ments, and lurrounds the Place in the'midft
of his Friends and Relations* During which,
fome put upon his Head a Garland of Straw
or dry Herbs, which they fill with burning
Coals, whereon they pour Sandarae^ which
catches Fire as ftrongly as Naphtha. Ne-
vertheless he continues the Proceihon, al-
though the Crown of his Head be ail on
Fire, and the Stench of his burnt Flelli be
* fine.lt, not fo much as changing Counte-
nance, in the leaft Degree, or betraying the
leaft Senfe of Pain. At laffc he comes to
the Pile, throws himfelf into it, and is foon
reduced to Allies.

A certain Perfon fays he faw one of thefe
Indians burn himfelf; and avers that when
he came near to the Pile, he drew out a
Cangiar, and with it ript down from his
Breaft to the Rim of his Belly ; and that
this done, he with his left Hand pulled
out a Flap of his Liver, and with the Can*
par cut off a Piece of it, which he gave to
one of his Brothers, talking all the Time,

and

and difplayirig an invincible Contempt of
Death, and a wonderful Patience under his
Torments, till at laft he leaped into the Fire,
to go to Hell

The Perfonwho told this, added that, in Indian*
the Mountains of this fame Country, there rd ^°. ha J ;e
are Indians who, in Opinions and Manners, q^^**
differ but little from thofe we call Kanifians
and Jelidtans, and who are addicted to all
Manner of Superrtition and Vice. There is
a great Emulation between thefe Mountai-
neers and the People on the Coaft ; the latter
continually going up to the Mountains to
dare the Inhabitants there to do as they doj
and the Mountaineers, on their part, as fre-
quently coming down to the Coarl with De-
fiances' of the fame Nature.

Among others, There once came down a A **y t*
Man on this Errand, and having gathered a ^ *
Number of the Inhabitants of the Coaffc a- ■ '
bout him, who came as well out of Curiofity
to fee the Sight as with Intent to imitate
him ; He told them to do what he was a*-
bout to perform, or, if they defpaired of
doing it, acknowledge themfelves overcome, /
He fat himfelf down then in a Place plan-
ted with Canes, and directed them to bend
one of them down to the Ground. Thefe
Canes are like our Sugar-Canes, bend like
them, and have a very large Stem : When
they are laid hold on at Top, they obey
and Hoop to the Ground ; but as foon as
they are let go, they violently fly up to
their firft Rectitude. One of' the larger*
of thefe he caufed to be bowed down to

his Height, and fattened his Hair ftrongly
thereto; when taking in hand his Cangiar
which fparkled like Fire, fo keen it was,
he laid to thofe about him, J am going to
cu: off my Head with this Cangiar, ~as foon
as it is j ever ed from my Body, let go the Cane,
and when it flies up with my Head I will laugh,
and Jo yea jtoall hear me do. The Peo-
ple of the Coaft had not Courage enough
to imitate him. The Perfon who related
theie Things to us, did it without Emotion
or Wonder, and in our Times thefe Facts
are very generally known ; for this part
of the Indies is in the Neighbourhood of
the Country of the Arabs, and we hear
from thence every Day.

Farthermore, it is a cuftomary Thing
A^' d ^" for Men and Women, of the Indian Blood,
auefi to be to defire thofe of their Family to throw
thrown in- them into the Fire, or drown them, when
to the Fire, they are grown old, or perceive themfelves
to link under the Weight of their Years ;
firmly believing they are to return in other
Bodies. They burn their Dead.

of People, while not a Soul of them dared
to attempt his Refcue : For if any Attempt
of the Kind was made, the Indian was fure
to kill the Merchant, and make away with
himfelf When he had got him out of the
City, he obliged him to redeem himfelf
with a great Sum of Money. This Outrage
continued till the Kings ordained, That e-
very Indian^ who prefumed upon the like,
fhould be feized; but offering to execute
this Order, the Indian killed the Merchant
firft, and then himfelf The fame Misfor-
tune befel many other Merchants, and after
this Manner did a Number, both of Arabs
and Indians^ perifh; wherefore the Mer-
chants fought after other Means to fecure
themfelves, and the Indians were no longer
apprehended.

In the Mountain of Sarandib they find Mines of
precious Stones of various Colours, Red, frecwus
Green, and Yellow, moil of which are, at ^"J^**
certain times, forced out of Caverns and o- Sarandib

thefe Places the King has his Officers to
keep an Eye over thole who pick them up.

They play alfo at Draughts, and venture
great Sums upon the Chance of this Game,
but with fuch Fury, That thofe who have not
wherewithal, Debauchees and defperate Peo«*
pie, often play away the Ends of their Fin-
gers. While they are at play, they have a
Fire by them, and thereon a Pot of Wal-
nut, or Sefame Oil ; they have no Oil of
Olives ; and they place a little, but very
iharp, Hatchet between them. When one
of them has won a Game, the other lays his
Hand upon a Stone, and the Winner cuts
off the End of the Lofer's Finger with the
Hatchet ; and the Patient dips his injured
Part into the boiling Oil, to cauterife the
Wound. And yet they cannot fhake off
this evil Habit of Gaming; on the contrary,
they fometimes periift in it fo obftinately
and fo long, that, before they part, they
have all their Fingers thus mutilated. Some
of them will take a Wick, and foaking it
in Oil, apply it to fome Member, fet Fire
to it, and let it burn fo that the Scent of
the burnt Flelh is fmelt by thofe who play
with them, while the Parties themfelves
betray not the leaft Senfe of Pain.

In the Indies there are heavy Rains, which
the People of the Country call J afar a. They
■laft three whole Months, during Summer,
inceflantly Night and Day, and icarce does
the Winter ftop them. The Indians^ to the
beft of their Abilities, prepare themfelves
againft thefe Rains, fome Time before they
fall ; and no fooner do they come on than
they ihut themfelves up in their Houfes,
made of Wood and Cane interwoven, and
thatched with Leaves. They ftir not out
during all this Time, and no Soul is feen a-
broad, no not even the Artificers, who
now dp their Work at Home ; and during
this Seafon they are fubjefl: to feveral Sorts
of Ulcers in the Sole of the Foot, caufed by
the Pamps.

Thefe Rains are the Life of the Indians*
were they to fail, they would be reduced
to the deepeft Want. For their Fields,
fown with Rice, are watered only by Rains,
and are fecundated thereby; if great Store
of Waper ly upon the Rice Grounds they
need no other help, or to be watered by

fhowered cjown, the Rice thrives abundant-

It never Rains in the Winter.

In the Indies, there are certain Men called Mian Pe*
Bicar, who go all their Life-time naked, ratents.
and fufler their Hair to grow till it hides
their hinder Parts, and the reft of their

but leave them to break and fall off as it
happens ; and this they obferve as a reli-

by Hunger, they Hop at the Door of fome

the Ring that hangs under his Nofe ; two
Men hold this Chain, and fo prevent the

That by all means he would feek after the
Ifland of Socotra, which afforded Aloes, an
excellent Drug, and without which they
could not make up the famous Medicament
called Hiera. That the belt way would be
to remove the Inhabitants thence, and, in-*
Head of them, plant a Colony of Greeks,
that they might fend Aloes into Syria,
Greece, and Egypt. Accordingly, Alexander
gave the neceiiary Orders to difpoflefs the
Inhabitants, and to fettle a Colony of
Greeks in their ftead. Then he command-

who hath produced all Creatures upon

and glorious Name.

Pearls begin to be formed of a Subitance,
at firrt, fomewhat like the Plant called An"
jedana, being of Size the fame, in Colour
and Figure pretty alike, fmall, thin,
and tender, juft like the Leaves of this
Plant. At firii it fwims feebly on the Sur-
face, and Hicks to the Sides of Ships, under
Water ; where, in time, it hardens, grows^
and gets covered with a Shell. When thefe
Oy Iters become heavy, they fall down to
the Bottom of the Sea, where they fubiift
after a manner to us unknown. They ap-
pear no other than a piece of red Flein,
like the Tongue towards the Root, with-
out Bones, Sinews, or Veins.

But there are various Opinions touching
the Production of Pearls ; and fome fay,
When it rains the Oy iters rife up to the
Surface, and that, gaping, the Drops of
Water they catch turn to Pearls. Others
fay they are generated in the Oy iters them-
felves, which is molt likely, and is con-
firmed by Experience. For molt that are
found in Oyrters, are fixed and move not :
When they are loofe the Merchants call
them Seed Pearl. God alone knoweth how
this Matter is. Now this is the molt won-
derful thing we have heard concerning the
Subfiftance of Oyfters, A



Of INDIA and CM IN" J. 9^

A certain Arab came formerly to BaJJbra, wStoryef
&nd brought with him a Pearl worth a great a FearI *
Sum of Money : He ihew'd it to a Drug-
girl of his Acquaintance, and, ignorant of
the Value thereof, asked him what he
thought of it. The Merchant telling hint
it was a Pearl, the Arab asked him what it
might be worth ; and he valued it at a hun-
dred Pieces of Silver. The Ardb, all afto-
nifhed at his Words, asked if any Perfon
would be willing to give him what he had
faid ; whereupon the Merchant counted out
a hundred Drams to him • and with this
Money did the Arab purchafe Corn td
carry back into his own Countty. The
Merchant, on the other hand, brought the 1
Pearl to Bagdad, and fold it at a very high
rate, which inabled him to deal very con-
iiderably thereafter. Now this fame Mer-
chant declared, that he had examined the
Arab touching the Origin of Pearls, and
that he delivered himfelf to the following
EfFea.

I was going along; laid he, by Saman, in Rn\ut
the Dirlricl: of 'Bahrein, not Very far diftant touching
from the Sea ; and upon the Sand I faw a the °«kj#
dead Fox, with fomething, at his Muzzle > - P€ar &'
that held him fare, i drew near, and faw \
a white, lucid Shell, in which I found the
Pearl I took. Hence he gathered, that
the Oyfter was upon ia^ Shore, driven thi-
ther by Tempeft, which very often hap-
pens. The Fox pairing by, and leering at
the Meat of the Oyrter, whofe Shell iiood
$Den, did jump thereon, and thruft in his
H ' Muzzle

Muzzle to feize the Fifh, who, doling,
locked him fall, as has been faid. For it is
a Property of theirs, never to let go their
hold of any thing, except forcibly opened
by an Iron at the Edges. This is the Oy-
fter that breeds Pearls, which it as carefully
keeps as a Mother her Child. When there-
fore it was feniible of the Fox, it withdrew,,
as to avoid an Enemy; and the Fox feeling
himfelf fqueezed, did beat the Ground on
each hand, till he was ftifled, and fo dyed.
The Arab found the Pearl, and God would
have it that he mould apply himfelf to the
Merchant, a very happy thing for him.
kinss of The Kings of the Indies wear Ear-rings
the Indies of precious Stones fet in Gold. They
wear Ear- wear aifo Collars of great Price, adorned
rings, Y/ixh precious Stones of divers Colours, but
efpecially green and red ; yet Pearls are
what they moil efteem, and their Value
furparTes that of all other Jewels ; they at
prefent hoard them up in their Treafures,
with their moll precious things. The Gran-
dees of their Court, trje great Officers and
Captains, wear the like Jewels in their
Collars. They drefs in a half Veft, and
carry a Parafol of Peacocks Feathers to

REMARKS, or NOTES

UPON THE

CHIEF PASSAGES

Of the Two Foregoing Accounts.

Of the Sea cf Harkand.

TH E Author, doubtleis, intends the Mat- [A }
dives, which, according to the Eaftern Geo-
graphers, divide the Sea or Lelarewi, or the
Sea of the great Gulf of India, as far as
Ras Kemoxi, or Cape Comcrln, from that of Harkand.
The Arabs and the other Orientals have Names
For the Seas, which bear no Affinity with thole of
the other Languages. Thefe Seas, without com-
prehending the Ocean which they call Bab-Mahit,
are, the Sea of China, the Sea of India, the Sea of
Perjia, thejSea ofKoIzum, or the Red Sea, ib cali'd
from a Town' which is thought to "be the Cly/ma : -
of the Ancients ; the Sea of Rum, or of Greece y
which is the Mediteranean ; the 'Sea cal&Jl-Chczar, or
the Caftian, and the Sea oiBont, or the PcnmrEuxi^
91ns. But thefe are not all the Names they give them ;
for the Sea of India is very often called the Green
Sea ; that of Perjia, the Sea of BaJJbra ; and other
Names they have for particular Parts of thefe Seas,
In like manner the Sea of Harkand, the Sea of /)<?-
larowi, the Sea of Zinge, or that on the Coaft of Bar-
bary, and the Dark Sea which was almoft unknown
to the Arabs, it ftretching away beyond the Ifland of
Madagascar or St. Lawrence, have different Names

from the different Coafts they wafli, and which
they alfb call the Salt Sea.
Geegraph. The Sea of Shelahet our Author mentions to b«
Arabic, divided by the Iflands of Ramn't, that is, by a Part
Qim. i. of the Continent of the Indies } muft be ibmewhere
p. g. in that extent of Sea from Cape Rajalgat to Mala-*

lar : But as this extent feems to be very great, one
would be apt to think this Sea extends but from
Sbelahet, which, according to Abulfeda, is a Town of
the Manibar, which is a Part of the Pemnfula of In-
dia within the Ganges, ftr etching from Gizsrat or
Gitzarat, to CouJam or Coulan.

I B ] In thefe Seas are about 1900 Iflands.

The Arabs had but a very imperfect Knowledge
of theie Iflands, and hence our Authors reckon them
but at 1900; but our exa& Navigators and Travel-
lers, and particularly Pyrard, have it that the Inha-
bitants talk of above twelve thoufand , and that the
King of the Maldives aflumes the Stile of King of
the twelve thoufand Iflands. The Nubian Geographer
calls them, with our Authors, Robaiat or Robihat 9
although the Name Maldive be more agreeable to
the Malabaric Tongue, in which Dive is an Ifland ;
whence we have Sarandib or Savandive, Angedive 9
and many others. Garcias de Orta, a learned Porta-
guefe Phyfician, fays, they muft be written Naledive 9
Dec. 2. 1. or tne Four Iflands, or rather as Bavros, the Thoufand
3. c. 7. Iflands; if after all it would not be better to lay
they borrow their Name from Maly, Maley, or Male %
the chief of them, where the King refides. The
Ancients knew next to nothing of theie Iflands ;
and we cannot tell when the Arabs landed among
them to propagate Mohammedifm, which they profefc
fed when firft discovered by the Povtuguefe. Barros re-
lates that the Pcrtuguefeofhls time had run about three
hundred Leagues along thgfe Iflands, from thofe of
Mamal, a Moor of Canancr who was Mafter of the
Northermoft, about forty Leagues from the Coaft of
Malabar, and in the Latitude of 12 Degrees and
30 Minutes ; and that the 'Southermoft they knew

wcr*



On the Foregoing Accounts. j

were thofe of Candu, and Adu in the feventh De-
gree of the Antartic Hemifphere : But that in the
Sea Charts of the Moors, thefe Iilands hy in a
Clufter along the Coaft of /wfo*, from the Flats or
Shelves of PxduafLO the Parallel of Mount Deli ; and
then ran away Eaftward till they almoft couched Ja-
va-head, and the Coaft of Sunda. The Pcrtuguefe and
Dutch Charts, which place thefe Iflands of Adu and
Candu a little more Northerly, take no Notice of
the others which mould have been found out after
fo many Voyages, to and again, in thefe Seas : But the
Moorifn Cnarrs are fb very inaccurate, that it is very
poflibly they ftretch out this String of Iflands much
farther than it really goes ; for by the later Voyages
k is certain that thefe Iflands, of a Clufter of which,
according to Pyrard, each Province or Group is
formed, each of which they call an Atollon, reach not
farther than 5 Degrees South. The Arabian Geo- Q\m. \\
grapher had certainly feen what our Author writes * g.
of thefe Iflands, which he defcribes accurately e-
nough, except when he relates that the Capital is
call'd Anabwa ; whereas in the original Text, which
is corrupted in the Roman Edition, it is faid that the
King ot the Ifles Robihat 1 the fame with the Mai- ■
dives, refides in the Ifland called Maly, or Male,
which this Geographer writes of the King of the
Ifland or Peninfulaot Comar, which forms the Point
and Part of the Eaftern Coaft of India.

He alfb calls thefe Iflands Robibat ; whereas our
Author fays, that all the Iflands were comprehended
under this Name, not excepting Ceylon or Sarandib ;
and whereas the Original from whence this Tranfla-
tion is borrowed, reads Dobij.at. In the Indian Tongue
Dive is an Ifland or Ifle, but the Arabs write it Dib t
as appears by their Sarandib, or Sielendiba, as it is
written in the Fragment of Co/mas Indopleufies.

Our Author fays, thefe Iflands were governed by Voyages fa
a Queen ; and the Nubian Geographer reports that Thevenct.
they have a King, but that his Wife has all the
Power in her own Hands, that me is uncontrolable Ubi fupra,
by the King, and orders all matters of State and
Property to her own good liking. The Hiftory of
thefe iUands ij too much in the dark for us to exa-
a 2 mine

mine into the Origin of this Cuftom, which wai
abolilhed before the Portuguefe firft came hither.
Perhaps the Arabs, who fettled here, introduced*
with Mchammedifm, many of their Cuftoms, and
among the reft that of excluding Women from all
public Employs ; or it may have happen'd that when
the Arabs difcovered thefe Iflands, lome Woman
ruled as Regent during her Son's Minority, iuch
being the known Cuftom over all the Molucca If-
lands ; which alio prevailed among even the Moguls \
whofe Empire, during the Minority^ of Gayuk Khan,
Lebtfarih was governed by Turakia Katun his Mother. And
thus the firft Difcoverers giving it out, that the
Iflands were under a Queen, eafily perfuaded others
that it was the ufual Form of the Government ;
and as Voyages hither did not happen often, they
remained a long time under this Miftake. And fo ic
was with the King of Morocco, who in the Year
1685, fpeaking of the EngUfh, faid, they were not
to compare with other Nations, becaufe they obey'd
a Woman ; for this Prince who valued himielf up-
on his Parts, had in forae of his Hiftories read ma-
fjackfayt n V tnm g s concerning Queen Elizabeth, in whofe
I Edit. p. & e *g n ™ e &*& Treaties of Commerce, with the King-
j ' dom of Morocco, were managed.. by Edmund Hogan, her
Majefty's Ambaffador to Muley Abdal-Malec King of
Morocco, in the Year mdlxxvii. /l rfA

What is faid of the Ambergreafe, which fo abounds
in thefe Iflands, is confirm'd by Garcias de Orta, Py-
rard, Barboja, and many other Travellers.

The Shells are ftill current among the Maldivefe 9
and in many Parts of the Indies, they pafs for final!
Money ; and not only in the Indies, but on the Coaft
of Guinea, and in the Kingdoms of Benin and Congo,
were they^ are uled in Traffic. Bar ros thus expref-
fes himfelf thereon. <Tbey have a kind of Shells a-
hout the Size of a Snail, but they are of another Shape,

being fet in Gold for Buttons, they look like enameU-
Sh'p ballafl with thefe Shells for Bengal and Siam,
where they are ufed at Market for change like our f mall
Copper Pieces. The fame Author takes Notice of the

Way they take thefe Shells, and therein agrees with P. 73. !•
our Author ; and Pyrard confirms what he fays of Bath, foe 9
the Treafures of thefe Shells the Princes of the citat.
Country have.

In the fame Sea towards the IJJand of Saran- [C]
dib are many Ijles.

It were to be wiflied our Author had exprefTed
himlelf a little clearer in this Paflage and many-
others, which relate to the Pofition and Place of the
Coafts and Iflands of the Indian Sea ; which can-
not eafilybe gathered from fb imperfect a Defcrip-
tion. He fays, that in the Sea beyond the Mal-
dives, there is a great Number of Iflands, or Penin-
fula's , the Arabs having no Word to exprefs thefe
laft : Wherefore they call Spain, Jezirai-al-Anda-
lus, The Ijland of Andalufia, becaufe it is waihed
by the Sea on three Sides. They therefore called
Illands or Peninlula's that vaft extent of Coaft from
Cape Comorin to China, where, it feems, we lrnift
place thofe Nations, who are but partly known to
us, and under very different Names. In thofe Coun-
tries we find all that our Authors and the Nubian
Geograper, their Copift, attribute to thele great In-
lands, but which cannot hold good of the Iflands
of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, which poflibly are
ibme of thofe described in the Sequel.

The Ifles our Authors call Ramni, are other-
wife called Rani, or Rana, and at this day give
Title to a Raja or idolatrous Prince of the Indies ,
who derives his origin from King Porus. In the
Arabian Geography this Ifland is called Rami as
in the Oriental Library of Mr. d*Herleht.

The Iflands of Najahalus, or Lajabalus, (for the
Name is fpelt both ways) are, it is probable, the imall
Ifles of Nicobar, where Ships (till generally touch
when bound to . fome Parts of the Indies.

Our Authors obferve, that in thefe Iflands there Q^.AreH
was a barbarous Race of Man-eaters 5 and this r u ^a.

they are grown old. He places thefe Barbarians
P. loo. between the Ifles of Nicobar and Tanacarim or Tan-
afarim : And this Cuftom remains to this Day, if we
may believe Navarettfi ; It is certain they eat alive
thofe Europeans they can cauh.
L.l.c.iS. Marco Polo tells us, that the Inhabitants of the If-
land he calls Andaman, devoured all thofe they
could lay Hands on. 'Teixeira fays alio of the Ja-
vans, that about an hundred Years before he wrote,
that is, about two hundred Year ago, they ate
Human Flefh, a Cuftom they unnaturally adhered to,
till fuch time as they imbraced Mohammedifm.
The Peguavs were guilty of the fame, and fold
Human Flefh publickiy. Moft of the Cafres on the
Coaft of Barbary are Anthropophagites alio, and par-
ticularly thole call'd Zimbas. Thefe in the Year
1589 made an Incurfion into the interior Afric,xo
the Number of 80000, and devoured all the Perfons
that fell into their Hands ; and thus defblated a
Tradfc of above three hundred Leagues. The Mum-
lot and moft of the other Cafres of Afric are Devou-
rers alio of the fame kind ; and the Portuguefe of
Mofambique, and the Neighbouring Parts, agree that
they ate the Bodies of fuch as were executed. M,
Jon. dos Pole, befides other Parts of the Indies and China 9
Santos where he obferves the People to be Anthropopha-
gi/?, de gites, fays, that in the Kingdom of Felech, which

Of the Ifland of Ceylon. c D 3

The Orientals know the Ifland of Ceylon by no y y a j e
other Name than Sarandib, which has fbme affinity cfhevenot.
with the ^.tiKzvS'iCcL of Of mas, the Author of the ^ x
Chrifiian topography. Dive, in the Indian Tongue, y^ e g afm
is an Ifland, and the Arabs, who have no V Con- dcf.p^iz,
fonant, do, after the manner of the Greeks, end e f.
their laft Syllable with a B. Thus all the Indian
Names ending in Dive, give you to underftand that
the Place meant, is either an Ifland or a Penin-
fula ; for moft of the Orientals have but one Word
for the one and the other. From Ceylon the Arabs
have formed Saran ; for the two Liquids L and R
are often converted into each other. Arvian writes,
that Weftward there lies an Ifland called TtrcL^cucrt-
lAMcPis, and by the Ancients Taprobana, where you

Miles in Circumference, and that it was governed
by two Kings, one of whom was Mafter of the
Mines oflacintb, or Iacintb, a general Name under
which are comprehended leverai forts of coloured
Stones, which the Arabs call Tacut or Iacu% ; that
fbme Perjian Chriftians were there fettled , and had
a Prieft, a Deacon, and all the Church Liturgy;
that the Kings and moft of the Inhabitants were
Strangers ; that Commodities were brought hither
from all Parts, and even from China, this Ifland
being as # it were in the Heart of all the Indies ;
that it is five Days diftant from the Continent of
the Indies ; and that its chief Scale was calTd Ma*

Mar.o Polo, under the Name of Ships of Ormuz ; ifi.p. z>
for at that time all the Commerce of Siraf y which
was afterwards trania&ed at the Ifle of Aw, was
remov'd to Ormuz. " The Ships of Ormuz are very
" bad and dangerous, and Merchants often run a very
c( great Rifque in them. For they cannot fatten
" their Planks with Bolts, becaufe the Wood is as
" hard and as brittle as Earthen-ware ; fo that when «

jo REMARKS.

Almofl: all the Modern Writers who have treated ©f
the Maldives and the Coco-nut, agree with our An-
cient Traveller in the manner of building thefe /«-
dian Embarkations ; and add, as a remarkable Circum-
flance, That this Tree alone not only affords Materials
wherewithal to build a Ship, but to load her alfo when
fiie is finifhed. The great Planks of theTrunk ferve
for her Hull and Mails; with the Filaments or Fi-
bres of the Nut they fpin the Cordage and the Sails ;
and they calk her with die coarfer Stuff, and the Oil
extracted from the Tree. They load her with Nuts
both green and dry, and of the Liquor they draw from
them, which is very pleafant and fweet at firft, but
turns into a Vinegar if kept, they make a kind of
Cream, Comfits, Butter, and an excellent Oil for
Wounds.

t F ] An unknown IJle where are Mines of Silver.

Amidft foch a Number of Iflands as are fcatter'd
op and down the Indian Sea, quite up to the Coaft of
China, it is a hard matter to fingle out which of them
our Author means. 1 It feems that even in his Days, the
Courfe to be fleered for this Ifland was loft, and that
Chance only directed Ships thither. There are Silver
Mines in moll of thefe Iflands, as Travellers fay.

Zufan y T/tffboff) or Whirl-wind.

Our Authors obferve that the Coaft of China is fub-
je& to violent Storms, and particularly to thofe Squalls
or Frets of Wind called, in their Language, Tufan,
from a Greek Word rvqoov, which fignifies almoft the
iame thing. The Portuguefe and Spaniards derive from
the Arabs their Word Tufaon, or fufon, whicb,on the Coaft
of China, comes on from the Eaftern Board, and begins
in the Month of Auguft. Navarette is in the wrong p # a.2%1
when he looks for the Etymology of this Word in the
Chinefe Language, in which, fays he, Tung fung is an
Eafterly Wind. The Indians of Manila call it Bagio,
and it is to the full as violent as the Hurricans among
the American Iflands. Thefe lyfhons are much to
be dreaded, efpecially in the PafTage from the Indies
to China, as we may perceive by many Examples to
be found in the Writings of the moll famous Naviga-
tors of thefe laft Ages. But although this Word is
originally Greek, and fignifies rather a Storm attended
with Thunder than a Tufan or Hurrican, during
which the Wind fhall fhift to every Point of the Com-
pafs ; yet the Arabs derive it from a Word of theirs
which fignifies to turn, believing it a Native of their
Tongue, juft as Navarette took it for an Offspring
of the Chinefe. Varenius fays, the Arabs called it OH- ,
fanf, he means Al-Tufan', but tho' he is out as to this, o* '4*/*
Jie defcribes it very exactly in his Univerfal Geography. z~$'

It appears like Sparks of Fire.

£ K ] -An IJland without Women.

This, very probably, is the Ifland mentioned by
Marco Polo : " Beyond Chefmacoran, about five hundred
** Miles in the main Sea, fomewhat Southerly, there
" are two Iflands, the one Mafculine, and the other
" Feminine, about thirty Miles wide of each other, In
" the one the Men live without the Women, and this

* f which is called the Feminine IJland, the Women.
/ live without the Men. The Inhabitants of thefe
44 Ifles are one People, however, and are baptized
" Chriftians. The Men crofs over to the Female
*' Ifland, and flay there three Months together, (viz.}
*' March, April, May, each in his Houfe with hi&
«' Wife ; and then return to the Male Ifland, where
*' they abide for the reft of the Year, following each.
" his Buiinefs, without the Participation of a Wife.
*' The Women keep the Male Children till they are
* f twelve Years old, and then' fend them to their Fa-
" thers : But the Girls they keep till they are of Age
" to Marry, and then difpofe of them to the Men of
** the other Ifland. It feems the Air of the Place will
" not allow the Men to be always with their Wives,
" becaufe they would dye. They have a Bifhop under-
" him of Socotra. " *

Nicdo di Conti has it, that they, are obliged to re-
tire after a three Months abode, or that otherwife they
would dye by the malignity of the Climate. We can fay
nothing of thefe Iflands, fince it is fo hard to hnd
them out by fuch an imperfeft Defcripticn. But what
Marco Polo fays, can never be true, with regard to the
Time the Men crofs over to the Women ; for being
Chriftians, the Bifcipline which ftill fubfifts in the
Churches of the Levant, would have obliged them to
have abitained from their Wives during Lent, which
they keep much about the fame Time we do. Nor is
it an eaiy matter to underitand how the Women could
live on their Ifland without any outward Worfhip,
which mull have been fufpended in the abfence of the
Clergy, who neverthelefs might crofs over at the Time
mentioned by Marco Polo, which happens to be alfo
the Seafon when they celebrate the Feaft of Eajier.

Hhe Courfe they Jteeredfo'r China. [ L ]

It is very difficult exactly to trace out the Courfe
the Arabs fleered for China, as it is found in our Au-
thors j not only becaufe many Towns they mention
have been deiiroyed, but alfo becaufe the Ancients, who
only coafted it along, held a different Rout from that
now fhaped by our' Pilots.

The Chinefe came . as far as Siraf, Jbut dared not
ftir beyond it, becaufe of the foulnefs of. the Weather,,
and the'heavinefs of. the Sea, which their Ships could
not live in. They did net then venture fo far as Ma-
dagascar,

Hijt. I. 6. dagafcar, as Father Martini pretends they did, becaufe
/. 237. in the Bay of Santa Clara there is a People refem-
bling the Chine fe, and not unlike them in Speech. He
offers nothing in Proof of this but the Report of fome
Seamen : But granting the thing to be as he would have
at, thefe Chine fe may have been driven thither by Tem-
peft, and there have taken up their abode, becaufe they
could not poifibly return back again to their Country.
On the other hand, it is evident that Navarette is
miflaken when he fays the Straits of Sincapor were
their Ne plus ultra.

Siraf v/sls formerly a Maritime Town in the Gulf
Ahdfeda c ^ Y er fi a > 60 Leagues from Shiraz, according to Abul-
r. \\q. f e ^a, or 63 according to Ebn Haukal. They place it
in 78 or 79 Degrees 30 Minutes of Longitude, and in
the Latitude of 26 Degrees 40 Minutes, or 29 and
30. They fay it was a Town of great Fame for
Trade, but that the Country about it was bare and un-
cultivated, becaufe of its fterility ; quite deftitute of Trees
or Gardens ; that the Heat was exceffive ; that the
Town was well built, and that fome of its private In-
habitants were 10 rich, as to have laid out thirty
thoufand Dinars, or fifteen thousand Piftoles French, in
railing and embellifhing their Houfes; and in fhort,
that moft of them were built with Wood brought from
p ^ the Country of the Franks, or Europe. The Arabian

Geographer, alfo mentions this City in many Places, in
the Defcription of the third Climate, as well as moil
Gel. in °f tne other Geographers. Trade ftill flourished
J If rag. p. there in the Days of Abulfeda, or about the beginning
n-r # of the fourteenth Century ; but when it began to mi-

grate to the Ifland of Kis-Ben-Omira, then Siraf foon
fell to decay ; but it made no long ftay at Kis, but
changed Seat for Ormuz, where it entirely fettled.

All the Arabian Ships put into Siraf, and efpecial-
ly when they came from Baffora, the chief Scale for
the Merchants of the Red Sea, Egypt, and even the
Coafl of Ethiopia. The Chinefe and Indian Merchants
brought thither all the Commodities the Eaft could
furnifh, whether from the Indies, the Terra frma, or
the Iflands then known.

They failed from Siraf to Mafcat, io the Country
of Oman, by Ptolomey called Qmannm Emporium, and



On the Foregoing Aaounts* s$

by Arrian, Omana. The Town alfb was called Sohar, Or In ?*rfyl9*
Sohar-Oman, or Shihr Oman. This Paffage is pretty dan-
gerous for the Rocks, Ifles, and Flats which lye in the
way. It is impoffible to fay what Places our Arabs mean,
iince they give us no Pofitions or Situations : But it mould
feem that Kaucamali, or Kaucam, is Cochim, or Cochin,
which it was eafy to reach in a Month's Paffage, with
the Wind aft ; becaufe of the Monfoons which are very-
regular. Immediately beyond Cochin, is the Sea of
Harkand, as the Arabs call it ; and in ranging along
the Shore, they firft touched at Cala, or Calabar, which
is the fame thing. An anonymous Perfian Author,
whpfe Abridgment, or Epitome of Geography, is in
the King's Library, fays, that this Town is in part in-
habited by Mojlems, or Mufulmen, and that there are
Trees here which yield Camphire, as may be. proved
by the Teftimony of Serapion, by reading Cala, inftead C. 144*
of Calca.

Our Author fays, that Cala, or Calabar, is about
a Month's fail from Kaucam, but this does not afford
us much light whereby to difcover its Pofition. Abu.
Zeid, the Author of the fecond Relation, feems to have
better explained the thing, faying, that the Ifle of Cala
is in the mid Paffage between China and the Country
of the Arabs, and that it is eighty Leagues in Cir-
cuit. Thus according to his Notion, it comprehends
an extent of Country under a Capital of the fame
Name, which muft have been fbmewhere about the
Point of Malabar.

From Cala in ten Days they reached a Place cal-
led Betuma : In Syriac, Beit-Touma, is the Houfe, or
Church of St. Thomas, which is upon the fame Rout,
and cannot be very far from Cala, or Calabar. The
Ancients muft have touched there, becaufe they lhaped
their Courfe between the Coaft and the Ifland of Cey-
lon ; whereas at prefent Ships ftretch to the Southward
of the Point de Gale, and fland over for the Ifles of
Nicobar which muft have been thofe of Najabalus, this
Name, it is probable, being equally corrupted by the
Arabs and by the Europeans. They are in eight De- y. Daws
grees of Northern Latitude, & confequently beyond Ca- a p, p urc fc
la and Betuma ; and thus there muft be fbme Tranf- y i r *
pofition in the Defcription of this Courfe, when they ,--

are named before Betuma and Katrange, or Kenerag>
according to Benjamin the Jew.

It is hard to fay what Place this laft was, if it be
not the Chitran in our Charts, as well as to find the
true Place of Senef, or Sanf, although the Aromatic
Wood {hipped there, was for many Ages known all
over the Eaft. Serapion, who {peaks of it, though it
can hardly be known in the Tranflation we have,
which reads Seifi inflead of Seneji, gives us fome Dir
rection towards finding this Place, by telling us it is
but three Leagues from Cape Comorin, or Ras Comri,
where the Wood Aloes is to be had, but it is not fo
good.
Clim. i. T ne -Arabian Geography, printed at Rome, can reflet

*. io. no Light upon this Obfcurity ; for the Text mult be

fadly diftorted, fmce it makes two difcinct Continents^
of Malai, which mould be the Point of Malabar, and
Senef, and fince it is very likely we mould read Kau-
kam-Mali, or ' Melai, inflead of 'Malai.

The fame Author fays, that from Senef they go to
Sandarfulat, or, as it is in the Arabic printed at Rome,
Sandifulat. The Word Pulo is frequently compounded
by the Malays, to hgnify, that the Places whofe Names
have that Adjunct,, or Affix, are Iflands : A nd there is
a great Number of thefe in the Sea from the Gulf of
Bengal, quite home to China. Fulat mull then be the
.Pulo of the Malays, and Sanddr Fulat may be Pula
.Condor which is the neareil to China, and may for
that Reafon be the Place the Arabs fleered for, when
they were bound for the Sea of China. And as their
Navigation was rather Coafling than Sailing, and as
their Ships were very handy and light, they might
the more fafely venture through the Straits of Sincapor,
and keep the Shore aboard all the way : And thus
they kept between that String of Iflands and Flats,,
■which llretches away from the Coafl of Cambodia, quite
home to the Mouth of Canton River ; nor muil we
wonder they were five or fix Weeks upon this Paflage.

It is difficult to trace out the particulars of this whole
Voyage by fuch defective helps ; and after all, that
might be done towards it, nothing but a bare Curiofity
could enjoy any Satisfaction in it ; for our Seamen at

prefent.

jprefent know more of thofe Seas, and how to fleer iri
them better than the greatefl Navigators of Anti-
quity.

The Sea of Sanji muft be fomewhere about the Gulf
of Cochinchina, which however, as has been obferved
by feveral Authors, is not the true Name of the Coun-
try, but Caocbi ; and even this is a Name impoied
on it by the Chinefe ; fo that this diverfity in the A-
rabic Name may borrow upon fome ancient Name of
the Country, we know not.

To a Place called Eetumai [ M 3

Betuma is a Syriac Compound, whofe true Ortho-
graphy is Bei't-Touma, which both in Arabic and Sy-
riac, is the Houfe or Church of St. Thomas. In like
manner the Syrians call the City of Martyropolis, Bar-
gamea, or Beit-Gar mea, and fo of others. But as much
as our Author leaves us in the dark as to the Courle
he rleered ; if we allow that Kaukam, or Qonkan, as
the Portugutfe write it, is fomewhere about the Gulf
of Cambaya, and if we grant that their Navigation
was no better than Coafling, which cannot well be
called in Queftion ; than need we not admire that the
Arabs mould reckon it a Month's Voyage from thence
to Betuma. Qalabar, Senef, Kadrange, or Chit ran,
are in the Neighbourhood of St. Thomas's. Marco Polo
and aimoit all the old Voyage Writers agree, that by
the Tradition of the Country St. Thomas mould be in-
terred in this very Place; and this is confirmed by
John di Empoli, Barbofa, Corfali, and aimoit. all the P. 146.
other flril Travellers. This Tradition is ftill in force 312. 31$,
among the Nejiorians ; and one of their moil famous
Authors, having iummarily touched upon the Preaching
of St. Thomas, fays, his Tomb was difcovered upon Amr. Hijf,
the Sea Shore, in a Village famous for being the Scene Ar.MSS.
of his Martyrdom. To this Tradition may be added °f the JYV-
that of the Malabar, and moil of the other Syrian fiorians.
Churches, who all believe St. Thomas penetrated in-
to the Indies, and that he there lies intombed: But
this fhall be treated more amply in the DifTertations
on the the Nefiorian Churches.

There is a Mohammedan Y^zdi fettled at C<m&\. j-qj

This remarkable Fact is to be found in no Author
older than this, and proves that the Mohammedans
went firft to China by Sea, allured thither [by the. Ad-
vantages of the Trade. This Moflem Judge or Kadi of
the Merchants, was properly a Conful : By degrees he
became Judge over all the Mohammedans ; and even
took on him the Religious Functions, prefiding at their
Religions Aifemblies. But our Author obferves it as
fomething very extraordinary, that the Merchants from
Irak were not againft his performing the Spiritual Of-
fice ; for it properly belonged to a Man of the Law,
and a Merchant could not regularly act therein ; and
he was Hill lels qualified to judge the Subjects of the Ka-
lif, without Authority from him.

The Sermon, or Cotbat, was a Difcourfe with which ^mir
the Imams , or Rectors of the Mofchs commonly ufhered Q on £ £fia
in their Fridays Prayers. Thefe Difcourfes confifled- of j g ^ *
Praifes to God, and to Mohammed, varied to the Cir- ^$0 P if! ,
cumftances of the Times ; and therein the Imams af- c co
fecled to difplay their Rhetoric, but efpecially when
the Mojletns had obtained any Advantage over the Chri-
ftians ; and they concluded with a Prayer for the Kalif,
as had been Cuflomary after the Kalif had laid alide
the Cuftom of Preaching the Cotbat in perfon, fo that
this was a kind of public Homage they paid him.
This is the Ceremony fo often mentioned in the Hi-
ilory of the Saracens, and all the other Oriental Wri-
tings. The Perfon in whofe Name the Cotbat was de-
livered, was thereby acknowledged Supreme : For which
Reafon the Princes of the Family of Buiya, the Seljw
kids, and the others of different Families, who revolted

whereas the Fatemites, who ufurped the Title of Kalif

ney, were all they had left. The Defendants otBulya,
who feized on all that part of A/a which owned obe-
dience to the Kali/s, ordered the Cotbat after this man-
ner ; the Kateb or Preacher, having offered up Praifes
to God and to Mohammed, began firft to fpeak of the
Kaiif, and then of the Saltan ; and the fame it was in
the matter of Coinage, for on one fide was the Ka-
lif** Name, and on the Reverfe the Saltans. The
fame was obferved by the Seljuhids : But as their Em j
■pire extended from Cajhgar quite into Egypt, and al-
moft to the very Gates of Conflantinople, and compre-
hended a great many tributary Principalities ; mention
was firil made of the Kali/ out of Religion, then of the
Sol tan out of Duty as Sovereign, and then of the Prince
himfelf, who by this Form acknowledged the Kali/his
Superior in Spirituals, and the Saltan, in Temporal Con-
cerns; and in paying this Honour, confided the De-
votion of the Mahommedan Princes, who adhered to
the Sonnite or Orthodox Kalifs. So Nuroddin the Sol-
tan of Syria, fet up the Cotbat in the Name of the
Kali/s all over his Dominions, and even in Egypt as
■foon as Saladin, who was general of his Forces, made
hiinfelf Mafter of Kahira or Cairo. And their exam
pie was followed by all the Mohammedan Prices in Me-
sopotamia, Syria, and Egypt, in the Year of the Hejra

their Army over him, put an end to the Kali/at. After
this the Mohammedans were without a Kali/, and the
Cotbat was fufpended for about four Years ; at the
Expiration of which Soltan Bibars-Bondokdari, the
Fourth of the Turkijb Mamluks, railed to that Dignity

Months afterwards with all that belonged to him. Hi-
lars then fat up another called Hakem, whom the Peo-
ple nick-named the Black Kalif; and him Bibars kept
a kind of Prifoner, clofe up in a Palace, and abridged
of all Liberty ; though honoured as Kalif, and par-
ticularly with the Cotbat or Sermon, which was deli-
vered in his Name in the Mofcb. The Turkijb and
CircaJJian Mamluks kept up this Cuftom, and the Prin-
ces, their Tributaries, did the fame, in acknowledg-
ment of the Pontiiicat and Sovereignty of the imagi-
nary Kali/-, and thus the thing flood, till the Defeat
and Death of Tumam-bey, the twenty third and Iaft Cz'r-
cajjian Soltan, who was hanged by the order of Selzm,
the Emperor of the Turks, in the Year of C&r?/? mdxv.
Thus upon this fecond Extinction of the Kalifat, to
which the Dignity of Mufti bears no manner of
Relation, the Ceremony of the Cotbat, although as old
as Mohammedifm itfelf, was intirely laid afide.

Now the Origin of this Ceremony was fiich : Mo- Elmac*
bammed as Prophet and Head of his own Sec\ ad- Emir,
dreffed the People on the Days of their Afiemblies ; and Cond. C5V.
that he might be the better underftood, he was wont to
mount an Eflrade fome fteps higher than where the refl
Hood. He began with Praifesto God, and particularly ex-
patiated upon what Thanks the Mohammedans ought to
return him, when they had gained any Advantage
over their Enemies ; and then opened to them the Bufi-
nefs that was to come under their Deliberation. And
in this was he imitated by the Kalifs his Succeflbrs,
till the rife of the Family of Ommiyah, with the Addi-
tion only of the Praifes of Moha7nmed. At the fame
time they communicated to the People the important
Affairs of the Public ; for in the beginning of Mo-
bammedifm the Government was not Monarchical, but
the Tribes of the Arabs, as thofe of Medina, Mecca,.
Bafra or Baffbra, and fome others, claimed a Share in
the public Adminiftration, which after public Prayers,
as had been faid, was brought upon the Carpet by the
Kalif

The firft Kalifs, and particularly AH, who was very
eloquent of Speech, affected to enrich their Diicourfes
with all the Strains of Rhetoric and Poetry, which
gave birth to the Cuftom of dreffing them up with all

the Pomp off Expreffion, and of mixing them with
Verfe and Pro e ; many Examples of which we have
in old Hiilories, and particularly in the Hiftory of E-
■mlr Cord. Moreover the Kalifs upon folemn Occa-
sions, and to IHr up the People by a' Remembrance
of their Prophet, appeared fometimes in White, when
they were to pronounce the Cotbat ; which in the Se-
quel gave rife to the Cuftom of appearing in a parti-
cular habit; and in Imitation of Mohammed, the K alif
mounted a kind of Pulpit or Gallery, called Man-
bar. But the Empire, fhortly after, increafmg to a great;
degree, and the Kalif having altered the firit. Form
of the Government, he aboliihed the old Cuftom,
and then the Cotbat began to be given in his Name,
by the Muftis, the Molla's, and other Officers of the
Mofdh. And now to the Praiies of God, and the
"Elegies of Mohammed, they added thofe of the Kalif:
and when it was pronounced for the firit. time after
the Elevation of a new Kalif, the People lifted up
their Hands, and put them one upon the other, which
was deemed as an Oath of Allegiance ; their left Hand
reprefenting that of the Kalif, and- by the right Hand
laid thereon, they fignified their old Form of taking
an Oath.

The Abbafids having deprived the Defendants of
Ommiyah, affumed the Black Garment, and when they
fpoke to the People, appeared always in Black r
whence thofe who delivered the Cotbat in their Name,
mounted the Gallery or Manbar in Black, which was
the Drefs of the Katebs in all the Parts where the
Abbajfids were acknowledged Supreme, either in Tem-
porals or Spirituals. The Manbar itfelf was hung
with Black ; and in this manner was it that the Ce-
remony was performed. On the other hand the Fa-
temite Kalifs, who called the Abbajfids Heretics, kept
to the white Veil, and hung the Manbar with a White
Carpet, becauie white was the Colour of Ali, whofe
Sectaries Hill wear white Vefts, or Sallies, as we
faw in the Ambafiador of Morocco and his Train,
who were of that Seel. Ever after then that the Ka-
lif gave over his Function, he delegated it to the Doc-
tors, the Men of the Law, or Derviles, nor could it
£>e canonically done without a'Miffion from the Prince.

After all this, the Reader will perceive why cm Arabs
were in fome fort alhonilhed that the Merchants of
Irak who traded with China, could bear to hear a
private Man go through the Cotbat or Sermon, in
the Name of the Kalif. For this Man had no Mif-
iion, he was no Doctor or Lawyer, and it mull have
feemed Hill more extraordinary to Mohammedans, that
fuch a Ceremony ihould be allowed in China, which,
to their way of thinking, feemed to erect the Spiri-
tual and Temporal Authority of the Kalif in the Coun-
try where it was ufed.

Four Great Ktngs^ £?<;. [ r ]

The Dialogue in the Second Part clears up what
is here faid, concerning the Account the Chinefe made
of Foreign Princes. We mull not wonder that our
two Authors, being Arabs, mould give the Kalif the
the frit Place ; but in fo doing we mull not tax them
with Prejudice or Prefumption, for, in reality, the Mo-
hammedan Empire was then at its height. Aaron
Rajhid, known in our Hillory by the Name and Title
of Aaron King of Perfia, taking Advantage of the
Victories of his Anceitors, the firlt Kalif s of the Fa-
mily of Abbas, had made himfelf Mailer of all AJia,
from Romania to the Tranfoxane; and the Moors of
Afric, Spain, and the Mediterranean Iilands were Sub-
ject to him. In all this vail Trad:, each way, the
Cotbat was pronounced in his Name, and the Money
was all coined with his Stamp ; and about his Reign
it was that the Arabs made their firffc Appearance in
China. The Mohammedans of thofe Days were not
only conhderable for their Power and their Treafures
heaped together from the Spoils of all the Eail, they
excelled in the Sciences and the fine Arts ; and their
Tranilations of the Greek Books under the Patronage
of and by the Encouragement of Al-Mamun the Son
of Aaron, together with his Kindnefs to Men of Let-
ters in general, made the Empire as great for Arts as
for Arms.

But the Emperor of China, fay they, reckoned him-

his own Judgment thereon.

This Balbara is dignified Emperor vfthofe nvbn have
■■ Ears bored, which is the common mode a-
mong the Indians. Moil: of the Arabian and Perjian
Geographers fpeak of this Prince juit as our Writers
do. Abulfeda treating of Maabar, which is Part of
what we call Malabar, fays, that The Capital is three
or four Das from Coulam ; and adds, that the Moun-
i of this Country border upon the Land of the King
wf Kings, or Emperor of the Indies, calfd Iibara ; where
it is plain we mull read Balhara. The Situations of
all thefe Places are fo very doubtful, that we can
hardly even guefs at them. The fame Writer fays
elfewhere, that The Country of Chanbalig, in its South-
ward extent, touches upon the Mountains of the Balha-
ra, the King of the Kings of the Indies. This PafTage
may be illuitrated by our Author, who fays, that The
Countr: urJ.er the Balhara reaches by Land from the
Coafl called Kamkam, to the Frontiers of China. The
P. 62. Arabian Geography relates, that the Seat of this Prince
is at Nahakvanah or Nebalwarab, a City which accor-
ding to the Tables of Kafir Eddin and Ulug Beig, is in
the Longitude of 102 Degrees 30 Minutes, and the
Latitude of 22, and therefore can have been neither Ca-
licut, nor Cochim, nor Vi/apor, nor yet any that have
been in Reputation for feveral Ages lait. pall.

What our Author tells us of the Power of this Prince,
can feemingly fquare with no others than the Anceibrs
of the Emperor of Calicut, who by the Relations of the
old Travellers, and as appears even by fome Books of the
Country., which were examined by the famous Hiito-
rian John de Barros, had been inverted with the Au-
thority of Emperor and King of Kings, over all the
Indian Princes.

The Commendations our Authors bellow on the B al-
ii ira fcr being particularly kind to the Arabs, futes very
naturally with thefe Princes ; the laft of whom, Sarama
P v.rivial became a Mohammedan, and took Shipping to
go and end his Days at Mecca.

The Portuguefe Hiftories relate, that this Prince or
Emperor of the Indies, tranflated himfelf to Calicut, for
the convenience of the Pepper Trade : It is therefore

probable

probable that before he fettled at Calicut, he redded fome- *
where in Guzarat, or in the neighbouring and more
Northern Country ; and fo the Mountains of the King-
dom of the Balhara, or the Cordillere which runs all
along Malabar, would have reached the Country of
Cha?ibalig, that is, the Frontiers of Turkeftan, then in
the hands of the Tartars, as well as of a part of China ;
and hence Abulfeda calls them the County oiChanbalig.

By the firll Relation or Account, we learn that the
Country of the Balbara begins upon the Coaft of the
Province of Kamkam, which may give Strength to the QeciA.cjl
foregoing Conjectures. For as Barros affirms ; All the c , j ,
Coajis which we reckon from the Mountain de Gate, and
which is but a long narrow Slip, is called Concan ; and
the People are properly called Conquenis, althd > we call
them, lays he, Canaris ; and the other Land which lies
within de Gate, fir etching E aft ward, is the Kingdom of
Decan, and the Inhabitants are Decanis. So Conkan,
or Kamkam, which is the fame thing, mult have been,
the Province where formerly the Balhara or Emperor
of the Indies kept his Court, before he removed to Ca-
licut ; and this is confirmed by a Perfian Geographer,
who fpeaking of Kamkam, fays it is the Pepper Country.

Notwithnanding it is no eafy Matter to point out the
City of his Refidence, yet by the Tables of Najfir Eddin
and Ulug-Beig, which place it in 22 Degrees of Lati-
tude, we may conceive that this City was at the Entrance ^ q 0#-»
of the Gulf of Cambaya, and that it was to all Ap- &ya£&
pearance the ancient Barygaza; for Arria?i, fays, $fi<cw j|
Near this City the Continent Jiretched down Southerly QuVcupriz
wherefore it was called Dakinabades ; for Dakan, in n7rei$&> cm,
the Language of the Country, fignifies South. Thus as <r« /3of in
according to the Moderns, Decan begins from the Coaft sk nr v'otov
called Concan or Kamkam ; fo according to the Ancients, e mA^A^- m
the fame Decan began from the moll famous Scale, which P5, <^to ^
was Barygaza. The Conformity of Dakin and Decan £&yjv ti-
ls felf-evident, and the word Abud, with which Arrian €a>Mt ko,~<
terminates his Greek Name, fignifies, moreover, a Coun- te%j »
try or inhabited Place, and is annexed to the Names of X®€£ ^ A ~
a great many Towns, as ttoKi? in Greek, Burg in Ger- X^^ $
man, and Ton in Englifli. Conkan according to Teixeira, KetKujo
begins from Chaul, and he fays that Vifapour is the Ca- v'qt&> tji

±6 REMARKS.

All this Teems to evince that this Title of Balhara
can be given to no other than the ancient S amor in or
Emperor of the Indies, who refided at Calicut fix hun-
dred Years and more before the Portuguefe arrived in
thofe Parts. And it is very likely that thofe Princes, who
from die very firft were fo kind to the Arabs, were the
very fame who brought them into Credit in the King-
dom, and iufFered them to fettle there. In Hiftory we
do not read of any Settlement of the Mohammedans in
thcfe Parts before that of Calicut, from whence they
fpread to all the trading Cities in India : therefore till
we meet with fome Hiilory of the Country to afford
us better Inftruction upon this head, we may ilick to this
Conjecture.

The Kingdoms or Provinces of Gtraz or Haraz, of
Tafck, of the Mouga, of the Mabed or Mayed. as the
Arabian Geographer writes them, mull be fomewhere on
the Continent between Cape Comorin and China. It is
well known that the Names of thefe Countries, as they
Hand with us, have been for the moll part corrupted ; and
that they are hard to be exprerTed in Arabian Characters :
It were then almoft to no purpofe to enter upon a number
of Conjectures, which, at the beft, muft be very doubt-
ful, from the little we know of the Hiftory of thefe
*A® « ui- P arts > an d the g reat Revolutions which may have hap-

The Portuguefe found no Moorifh Settlement on all the

that this Sea had Communication with that of Barbary

p. 94. us, that the Chinefe have upon this Head fome Notions

not veiy unlike thofe of the Pytbagoricians. Father
Grueber avers that all the Chinefe are Idolaters at Hearr>
and that in private they all worfhip Idols : That true
it is they feem to be divided into three Seels ; but
that even their Sect of Literati, who profefs to a-
dore a fuperior Subftance which they call Xan-ti, have
thefe words written in Gold in all their Temples, and
adulate them with Offerings of Paper, Wax Tapers, and
Incenfe, purely by this form to diftinguifh themfelves
from other Seels, and particularly the Bonzes. Thefe,
lays he, came from the Indies into China, and it is im*
poflible to conceive what Veneration and Efteem was
paid them on account of their Doctrine of the tranfmi-
gration of Souls, altho' it differed fomewhat from what
was taught by the Pytbagoricians. In a word, all the
Authors who have written concerning China, agree with
thefe. The Indians believed and to this day believe
the Metempfychofis differently from the Pythagorcians ;
In Ahul- and the Arabs, before Mohammedifm, taught it after a
farg. p. particular manner, as Dr. Pocock will fatisfy you. The
13;. Chinefe will have it, that the Doelrine of Fe or the

At/. 198. Metempfychofis, came from Kieo in Junnan : but whence
Trig. I 1 . foever it came, it is thereto owing, that they often mur-
qa der their Children, when they think they cannot

Men who devote themfelves* [ Z ]

The Portugnefe Hiftories fufficiently abound with Ex-
amples of Men who have devoted themfelves to certain
Death upon great Occafions ; and this the Portuguefe, in
their Hiibries, term Fazer fe Amoucos. It is a Cuftom
of very ancient Date; witnefs the Ambacli and Soludurii
among the Gauls, who engaged to die with their King,
as C&Jar and Athenaus will inform you.

The Inhabitants of Ceylon would do the fame, and a
Number of Perfons of Quality, filled Faithful to the King
in this World and the next, were wont, as Marco Polo

This is an ancient and univerfal Cuftom in the Indies,
where it has taken fuch deep root, that it fubiifts to this
Day. All Accounts, both ancient and modern, confirm
this, and agree with what the Greeks and the Latins have
written upo^ the fame Subject. However it is but feldom
s now, that Men burn themfelves deliberately ; and it is
a long while fmce any Bramin has followed the Exam-
ple of Calanus, and fome other old Philofophers, who,
being fick of Life, committed themfelves to the Flames :
But it is ftill common for the Women to burn themfelves
with their deceafed Husbands. And altho' the Mohamme*
dans, at prefent Matters of a great part of the Indies, where
this Cuftom chiefly obtains, endeavour all they can to
fupprefs it, they have hitherto wrought in vain to eradi-
cate this cruel Superftition fo much preached up by Bra-

The Name Braminis formed from that of Brachman;
which was ufed by the Greeks and Latins to fignify the
Indian Philofbphers, who are much mentioned in the
Arabian Writings. Our Author reports, that there was
a great Number of them at Kanuge, a City, which, ac-
cording to Abulfeda, is in 131, that is 141 Degrees 50
Minutes of Longitude, and in 29 or 27 Degrees of Lati-
tude. It ftands between two Branches of the Ganges,
Eaftward of Multan, in the furthermofl Parts of the In-
dies, and is diflantfrom this faid Town of Mutt an about
c c lxxx 1 1 Leagues, if Alazi%z be right. The King here
has two thGufend five hundred Elephants ; and the City is
handfomj, large, and a great Mart, like Kahira or Cairo
in Egypt. The King himfelf is called Kanuge, and has
many Mines of Gold in his Country, as is confirmed by
the Perfian Geographer. The Indian Hiftories make
mention of the City of Canofe ; and Barros relates that it
is near the Place where the Ganges meets the Gemna.
But the ordinary Refidence of the Bramins, and the Uni-
verfity, as we may iay, of all the Indian Doftors, is
Benares, or, as others pronounce it, Banarus, or as it is
called in the Tables of Ulug Beig and Nqffir Eddin, Ba-
narji. Bernier Tavernier, and the belt Travellers dwell
much on this Place. Kanuge, or Kennaug\ is, in the

5<S REMARKS

Tents or Tabernacles of thefe Women were much like
L. 2. c. 38. thofe defcrib'd by oiy Author. In Marco Polo, we read
that the People of the Province of Cainda did the fame
thing; expofmg their Women in honour of their Idols.
T. 2. /. Tavernier fpeaks of a Pagod near Cambaya, whither mofl

2, 5. of the Courtezans of the Indies repair to make their Of-

ferings : And adds, that old Women, who have fcra-
ped together a Sum of Money, buy young female Slaves,
whom they train up to wanton Songs and Dances, and all
the Allurements of their infamous Calling : And that
when thefe Girls have attained their eleventh or twelfth
Year, their Miftreiles conducl them to this Pagod, under a
Notion that it is a Happinefs for them to be offered, and
delivered up to the Idol.

Again, we are told by Marco Polo, that there was a
like Cuftom in the Province of Camul, where it was pro-
hibited by Mangu Khan, whofe Command was obeyed for
three Years ; but obferving that their Lands did not pro-
duce as ufual, they, at the Expiration of the aforefaid
Term, fent Deputies to Mangu Khan to reprefent to him,

feda, in 92 Degrees of Longitude, and 29 Degrees 40
Minutes of Latitude. According to Ebn Haukal it is
twelve Days diilant from Almanfur, which is a greater
Diitance than is allow'd by our Author. Abulfeda fpeaks
of this Idol, and fays it is dreffed in red Leather, and
has two great Pearls for Eyes. The Emir who was Lord

The IJland of Socotra. [ GG ]

This Story is told, in almoft the fame Words, in the
Arabian Geography printed at Rome, as alfo in almoft all
the Oriental Geographers. They all imagine that the
Difcovery of the Iile of Aloes, is one of the greateft Inci-
dents of Alexander's Progrefs ; and this tljey imagine from
the great Account they make of this Drug, which is one
of the firft Ingredients in their Materia Medica.You may
fee what is faid of it by Ebn Sina, or Avicen, as we call
him, and by the other Arabian Phyficians, and, among
the Moderns, by Gar das de Orta, and fome others it
were needlefs to cite.

Marco Polo relates of this Ifland, that its Inhabitants £. a.r.343
were Chriftians, and that they had an Archbifliop under
a Zatolic, who refided at Bagdad;, that is, a Catholico or
Patriarch of the Nejiorians. For the Arabs writing Ca-
tholic with an afpirated Letter, which is of the fame
Power with our J confonant or G, were it not for a Point
underneath, many have fpelt it Jatolic ; whence Marco
Polo, who was a Venetian, forms his Zatolic, pronouncing
the G or J after the manner of his Country.

The Port uguefe Authors, on the contrary, will have B arras
them to be Jacobites, or fubjec"l to the fchifmatical Patri- Dec. z. I. r .
archs of Antioch ov Alexandria. When the Portuguefe ci.Purcb*
firft came to this Ifland, the Inhabitants appeared to them /,. 778,
with Croffes in their Hands, to fhew they were Chri-
ftians : But Odoardo Barbofa fays, that, in his time, they J* 202,,
had hardly any Notion of Baptifm, and that they had no-
thing left to diftinguiih them as Chriftians but the bare
Name.

They have the Sonna in Arabic, [ HH ]

We do not fee how this Paflage can be other-
wife underftood, tho' the Translators of the Arabian
Geographer, who has copied it, underftand it in a dif-
ferent Senfe, becaufe the Text is mangled a little:



38 REMARKS

Dcgit enlm in ipfis natlo qu&dam Arabum, qui cft<verjft
Cif antiquis utuntur Unguis, Arabibus hac nofra tempejiate
ignotis. Thus is it the Maronites tranflate this Paffage,
wherein they are confeffedly miltaken. For this Paffage
does not relate to two fmall Iflands, but to that Arabia by
the Ancients called Libanophoros, by the Arabs themselves
Sbihr,a.nd by Ptolomey £ v .-,>■, where dwelt the oXdArabian
Tribes, Ad, Hamyar, Jorham, and Thabateba, who em-
braced Mohammedifm. Thefe Arabs had, Deiides the
Koran, many Stories and Traditions touching the Mo-
hammedan Religion, which they received from the Com-
panions of their Prophet, and his Difciples. From thefe
Traditions and Stories, they form the Body of their Sonna,
which therefore is very different in different Places ; fo
that not only the Sonna of the Perjians differs from that
of the Arabians, but that of the Africans varies from that
of Mecca and the Arabians of the Defart. From this
Variety a Number of Sects have arifen in the Moham-
medan Profeffion ; and thefe Seels have divided Moham-
medifm, and introduced feveral Variations in the Expo-
fition of their Koran, and in their Jurifprudence. The
Tradition of the old Arabs was the moll authentic, and
could not be mixed with fo much Novelty and foreign
matter as the Tradition of other Countries, where it
was multiplied World without end.

This was the fundamental Principle of the Science the
Fakis or Arabian Doctors profeffed. Ebn Kalican re-
lates, in the Life of one of the moft famous of them, Abu,
Tacub Ifaac,ihe Difciple of Kafei, and the Head of one of
their Sect ; That he boafted of knowing by heart feventy
thoufand Hadith, or Stories, concerning Mohammed and
Lis firft Companions, and a hundred thoufand others of
lefs importance on the fame Subject. They cite them in
their Books with the Names of their Authors, and the
Names of thofe thefe had them from, quite up to the
£rft, as the Jews do in the Talmud.

We muft not wonder therefore, if the Tradition was
different 'from the Vulgar contained in the Sonna among
fhe Arabians of the conquered Countries. . In thofe
Countries there are ftill old Copies of the Sonna } which
are fo different from the modern, that they have fcarce
gpy thing in common with them,

HISTORY and CUSTOMS of

CHINA-



FEW Eaftern Writers liave written worthily of
China, although moft of them are fond of dwel-
ling thereon. But what they write is fo confined, ib
inaccurate, and fo Huffed with Fable that it is eafy
to fee they knew next to nothing of the Situation
and Remarkables of that Empire. The Greek and
Latin Geographers, whom the Arabs perufed in faul-
ty Tranflations, could lend them no helping Hand
in this Part of Afia, which was but litde known to
the Ancients ; and our two Authors are, perhaps, the
firft that have written tolerably on this Head. By the
Paflagesthe Nubian Geographer copies from them, with-
out naming them, it appears that in his Time there were
no Memoirs of more Value for what concerned China ;
and if the other Geographers have made but little
life of them, it is, feemingly, becaufe they thought them
Fabulous, as Abulfeda declares he did, in feveral Places,
The Accounts of the late Travellers, and particularly
thofe of Father Trigaut, and Father Semedo, and the fe-
veral Tracts of Father Martini have more amply in-
ftructed us in the Geography, Natural Hiftory, Manners,
and Cuftoms of China, than all that had been written
before. But as for the Illuftration of Hiilory, it may
be proper to compare the Ancient Accounts with the •
Modern, juft as Father Martini has in many Places ex- J t f as £ l n
plained Marco Polo, whom the Ignorance of part times
rejected as a Fabulift j it may be as proper to fhew
that our two Authors fo often agree with our late Wri-

REMARKS

carlieft Travellers : And it will be perceived by the
following Remarks, that, fome Points excepted, which
ftill want illuftration, they abound with very judicious
Obfervations, and fuch as are perfectly confonant with
our latell Informations.

It were to no purpofe to undertake a Juftification of
the letter Circumltances to be found in our Authors, by
a great Number of Citations. They may have been
miftaken in fome things, which new Difcoveries may
clear up hereafter ; but if they fometimes happen to
vary from the Modern Accounts, we mull not at once
conclude they are wrong ; for China, as well as every
other State, has been fubjecT: to great Revolutions,
which muft have wrought great Changes in the Go-
vernment and the Cuftoms ; and perhaps the more we
mail come to the Knowledge of the Chinefe Hiftory,
the more we mail be convinced of the Accuracy of
the old Travellers.

Let us firit examine into what our two Authors fay
of the Country in general. It feems they knew it by
the Name of Sin, which the Arabs borrowed from
Ptolemey. Thus it is that Ebn Said, Tacuti, Abulfeda,
and moft of the Eaftem Geographers call this Empire.
The Psrfians, however, pronounce it Tchin, much like
the Italians and Portuguefe ; a Name which may have
been impofed by Strangers, either becaufe the Chinefe
in their Salute fay, Chin Chin, or Ching Ching, or
from the Emperors of the Family of China as Father
Martini thinks.

Father Aleni the Jefuit fays, that in a Chinefe Book
. cited by Na-varette, China fignifies the Country of Silk ;
while others will have it that China fignifies to ohfer<ve the
South ; and the Merchants coming in from that Quar-
ter, may alfo have given Birth to this Name ; at leaft
we may afliire our felves it is of old Date among the
Arabs. The Name of Cathay, which is alfo much
ufed, did properly belong to the moft Weftern Parts of
China, and probably derives it Origen from thofe Scy-
thians beyond Mount Imaus, whom the Greeks called
Xet'iJ). Father Trrgaut, Father Martini, and, in a
Word, Golius, have evidently demonftrated, that the
Cata'i of Marco Polo, and our ancient Travellers muft
not be fought for out of China ; But they have not

fuffh



On the Foregoing Accounts. 41

famciently explained this Diftin&ion ; and what G alius
offers as a Proof (<vix.) that Mis. 7 ; Cata'i, and Teh a
Cata'i, fignify Musk and Tea of China, makes good
this Remark, fmce Musk comes from Tibet and the
adjoining Provinces, and Tea alio. But we do not
find that the Arabians and Perfians gave the Name
of Cathay to the Southern Provinces ; yet, certain
it is that all they report of the Magnificence of the
Khan of Cathay, muft be underftood of the Emperor
of China, and that the Cambalu or Chanbalig of the
Orientals, can be no other than Pekin : And here let
it be obferved, that thefe Forms of Speech came from
Perfia, and the Provinces of the Upper Afia, conter-
minous with China', and that this Name was pecu-
liar to the Weftern and Northern Provinces only,
which alone were conquered by Jenghiz, Khan, the
Emperor of the Moguls.

At the fame time it may be pertinent to take no-
tice that VoJJtus is quite miftaken, when, with his ufual
Confidence, he is fure the Portuguefe were the firil that
called the Country China, which he will have to be
the ancient Serica, and that the Chinefe mould be
called Seres, as he always calls them. For the Por-
tuguefexveft "unacquainted with China, till the fixteenth
Century, and our Arabian Travellers wrote in the
Ninth; and yet we mult not fuppofe they were the
Authors of this Name, which was in ufe long before
them. The Appellation of Seres is equally unknown
to the Chinefe, the Arabs, and the Perfians, nor is it
an eafy matter to prove that it bears any Relation to
the Inhabitants' of China properly fo called, fmce Pto-
lomey diilinguifhes the Seres from the Chinefe, whom
he calls Xi>cu.

It feems our Authors were but flenderly informed
of the Limits of China, fince they confine themfelves
to the Sea-port where the Merchants traded, the Capi-
tal of the Empire, and the Provinces next to the King-
dom of Samarkand. They fay that the Sogd of Sa-
markand 'is but about a two Months Journey from it,
which fquares with the Tables olAbu/feda,and the Au-
thor he cites, oiUlugBeig, and fome others. They
obferve that the Kingdom ofTibat, Tobit, or Tobat, for
ib the Arabs pronounce it* is not far diftant from the

iai4



4 i REMARKS

faid Provinces ; and the County of Tagazgaz, or &
hazaz, if this Name is not corrupted, is conterminous
therewith, on the Eaft. By this Word we might be
induced to think that we are to underftand the Peo-
ple of Laos. Thofe called Mabed, Mujet, and fome
others mentioned in the one and the other Account, muft
be placed between Tibet and Bengal; but it is a hard
matter to know them again in a flrange Tongue, and
after fuch great Revolutions, whofe Hiftory we know
not.

What our Author relates of the Number of Cities irt
China is confonant with the Reports of the late Tra-
vellers ; for our Arabs fay, that in China there are
above two hundred Cities, which have many others
fubordinate to them. Now, Father Trigaut reckons two
hundred forty feven ; Father Martini fays, one hundred
and fifty ; and Navarette reduces the Number to one
hundred forty eight of the firfl Order; but it is no
difficult matter to believe that the Number of thefe
Capitals may have increafed and decreafed according
to the different Alterations which have happened in this
Empire.
Canfu. Canfu was the City bell known to the Arabs, be

caufe it was the Scale of all the Commerce with the
Indies, Perfia and Arabia. The Rocks called the
Gates of China, in our firfl Account, muft be iht Hies
which lie between the Coaft of Cochinchina, and the
Mouth of Canton River. The Arabs required eight
Days to fleer through them, becaufe of the Dangers
they ran of mifcarrying among them; a trouble they
might have avoided by fhaping their Courfe directly
for the Ifland of Hainan, or Ainam, which is, proba-
bly, what they call Alnian. Canfu muft be Changcheu,
or Quantung, now commonly fpelt Canton'. Fu and
Cheu are two Terminations, the firft of which being
added to the Name of a Place, denotes it to be a Ca-
pital City, and the fecond is to denote a City only.
Canfu was but a little way from the Sea, and flood
upon a great River, which Ships entered with the Tide,
and this Situation agrees perfectly with that of Canton.
#.369. This City is mentioned in the Nubian Geographer, but
both in the Original arid in the Tranflation the Name
is very much corrupted, being written Caitaku^ and the

fame



On the Foregoing Accounts. 43

feme Inaccuracy may be obferved in Abulfeda, who
iays, this City was known in his time by the Name of
Can/a. He places it in 164 Degrees 40 Minutes
of Longitude, and 28 Degrees, 30 Minutes of Latitude;
and adds, that " By the Accounts of* fome Travellers,
" it is the greater* trading City in all China. That
" he had been informed by a Man who had been there,
" that it Hands to the South-Eafl of Zeitun, half a
" Day from the Sea, and upon the Branch of a River
"" which forms a Canal, navigable by the largeft Ve£
*' fels. That it is extremely large, and that its inclo-
<e fure furrounds four miall Eminences ; that they there
" drink Well-water ; that it had very pleafant Gardens,
* c and that it flood about two Days diftant from the
■* Mountains." By this flender Defcription it fufficiently
appears, that this Geographer was but poorly acquainted
with the Situation of the capital Cities of China, and
moll of the others fpeak with the fame Obfcurity. BuC
our two Authors leave no room to doubt of the true
Orthography of this Name, and Abulfeda\ Conjecture
cannot be borne, fmce, to all appearance, his City of
Can/a, muft be Changcheu, or fome maritime City of
Eminence for Trade in his time. a

But it is a far more intricate Task to afcertain what q j
place our Authors may mean when they ipeak of Cum- Um aa *
dan, where they fay the Emperor of China then re- -
iided. This City they fo often mention, that there is
no ground to imagine the Text to be corrupted ; and
the Chinefe and Syriac Infcription, found in the Pro-
vince of Xenji or Chenfi, in the Year mdcxXv, con- r ,.
firms what they advance \ for in the Syriac words . !. na
Cumdan is called the Royal City, and the Capital of l "ft r ? ta
Qhina. Now the two Cities where the Emperors have l '
for many Ages pail reiided, are Pekin and Nankin;
but the firft which is thought to be the Cambalu of
Marco Polo, and the Chanbalig of the Orientals, has
not enjoyed this Dignity above ccccl Years, or there-
abouts ; fo that in the Days of our two Authors, Nan-
kin, otherwife called Kiangnang, was the Capital of the
Empire, and the place v/herc the Emperors of China
kept their Court.

Cumdan muft then be Nankin, nor can we well Cumdan
$mty % face the Arabian Geographer, fpeaking of muft b e

the Nankin



44 REMARKS

the greateft River in China, which certainly is tie
Kiang, calls it the River of Cumdan, becaufe it flows
through Nankin, the only City that crowns that River,
which had for feveral Ages been the Seat of the Em-
pire. Therefore is this Town called Nankin, or the
Southern Court, whereas Pekin fignifies the Northern
Court. The Syrians, who wrote the Chine fe Infcription,
we juft now mentioned, have another Title for it, and call
it the Eafiern Court ; and thus this City may have been
lliled by the Chinefe, and, perhaps, the different Names
Martin. of Kingling, Moling, Kianle, Kiangnmg, Kiangnang, and
Atlas t \ 29. Ingtien, which it has borne under different Royal Fami-
lies, may import what the Syrians have in their Infcrip-
tion : But without entring into this Labyrinth, it is ealy
to perceive that it was natural enough for the Syrians to
call it the Eafiern Court ; for of all the Royal Cities in
China, it was the moll Eailward from them who came
from Syria by the way of Tibet. The magnificent De-
fer jptions our Authors give of this City can agree with
no other than Nankin ; for Pekin was not yet the Seat of
the Emperor, and even when it was thither transferred,
Nankin did not fade much away till the laft Wars, that it
was entirely facked by the Tartars.

firtddin, and Ulug Beig give their City of Biju, can be
applied to Nankin, and even they differ among themfelves,
fome placing it in 124 Degrees, and others in 130; but
we deduce thus much from the Situation of the City,
which they fay is fome Days diftant from the Sea, and
not very far from Can/a, which, tho' it cannot be faid
either of Nankin or Pekin, yet it may be more truly re-
ferred to the former than to the latter of thefe Cities.
And this is the more to be regarded, inafmuch as fome
very accurate Writers have evidently demonftrated, that Got. dp-
the Cambalu of Marco Polo, and the Chanbalig of the pend. ad
Orientals, can be no other than Pekin, the Pofition of Allantem
the one and the other coinciding nicely enough. Sin.

Among all the different Names of Nankin, we do not
find it was ever called Cumdan, and it is very probable
that this Name is not fpelt exactly by the Chinefe Ortho-
graphy : But it is enough for us that this Town was
known by this Name among the Orientals ; and the Con-
formity of the Chinefe and Syriac Stone, with our two
Authors, as to the Name of this City, is well worthy our
Obfervation, and may inconteftably confirm what they
Write.

All that our Authors report of the Magnificence of this
City is agreeable to the Defcription of Nankin, in the
Relations of the Fathers Trigaut and Martini.

Our Authors fpeak of the Government of China in Tfo Go~
Terms which prove them to have been been no Strangers <vemment
thereto ; for notwithftandng the extraordinary Revolutions of China,
which have there happened within eight hundred Years
paft, what they fay is, in its pricipal Circumftances,
confirmed by the Teftimony of the later Voyagers.

They take notice that China was governed by an Em-
peror, who was fupreme and abfolute over all the Gover-
nors of Provinces, whom they flile Kings. The Arabic I
Word, Make, which they ufe, does not actually import
a King, according to the Senfe and Meaning of thole who
wrote contemporarily with our Authors, or in the follow- '
ing times. As the firfi: Mohammedan Sovereigns affamed
the Title of Kalifs, or Vicars of God upon Earth, and Sue-
cejfors of Mohammed; this ftile was peculiar to his Defen-
dants, or, thofe who pretended fo to be, in the Sequel.
The Kalif enjoyed all Authority, both in Spirituals and
Temporals, and no Mohammedan that ere&ed himfelf

into a Prince, and particularly after the AbbaJJtds, aflunik
ed that Title free from Schifm ; for the Fatemitei
of Egypt, and fome other Princes of lefs Note, who pre-
sumed to take it on them, were guilty not of De-
fection only, but of Schifm alfo, and were rejected as
Heretics by the other Mahommedans. But thofe who ad-
hered to the Bulk of Mohammed's Followers, and remained
in Subjection to the Kalif at Bagdad, and who to this
Day call themfelves Sonnis, pretended to no more than
the Quality of S oh an or Prince. Make was a Surname:
peculiar to the Branches of the Royal Family, and was
granted, as an Honour, to tributary Princes, who ac-
knowledged either the Kalif s or the Soltans. We muft
not therefore wonder, that thefe Governors of Cities and
Provinces, who ruled almoil with a fovereign Sway, tho*
at the fame time Subordinate to the Emperor, mould be
dignified Make, or Kings,, by the Arabs ; and efpecially
fmce our later Travellers ufe the fame Term. Thus
Marco Polo, Father Trigaut, Father Martini, Navarette^
and the Dutch not only ftile the Princes of the Royal Fa-
mily by the Title of Kings, but the Governors alfo ; and
both the one and the other obferve with our Authors, that
thefe petty Kings are in Subordination to the Emperor,
befides that Navarette reports the feveral Provinces of
China to have been formerly fo many Kingdoms.

The Arabs commonly write, that the Emperor of C hind
is commonly called Bagbun, tho', according to the moil
ancient of our Authors, they in his Days pronounced it
Magbun. But others, as Abulfeda, and an old Perjian
Author, call him Fag fur, and pretend this and Tumgage t
or Tumga% Khan to be fynonymous ; and Marco Polo
calls thofe Kings by the Name or Title of Fan/ur, who
preceded the Tartars, under whom he went into China.
They all agree that this Title figniffes the Son ofHeavent
and our lait Accounts agree as to the Senfe of this Word*
but inftead of it they give us another, Tiencu, to fignify
the fame thing, and hence, perhaps, the Arabs formed
their Tumgage, which is otherwife fpelt Timjage, and after
other ways.

We muft not wonder that our two Authors tell us no-
thing of the Royal Family of the Emperors who reigned
in their times ; for we can reap no manner of Information
from any other of the Arabian Writers, or the Per/tan,

who did not begin to know China till towards the twelfth
Century, when the Tartars became Mafters of it. But
the total Revolution, mentioned in the fecond Account,
is the more remarkable, as it fquares very exactly with
what we read in the Beginning of Father Martini's
Chincfe Atlas. He fays, that from the Year ccxi before 2. I
Chriit, when the Family of Hana mounted the Throne,
upon the Deprivation of the Family of Cyna ; the Princes
of the aforefaid Family of Hana reigned till the Year
. gclxiv after Chriit ; and that then the Family of Cyna
fucceeded, and held the Throne till the Year ccccix of
the fame. Then five Kings rofe up againft each other,
and commenced the War of the Utai, as it is called,
which was carried on till four of thefe Utai being de-
feated, the fifth, of the Family of Tunga, feized on the
-Empire in the Year dcxviii. That in a fhort time af-
terwards the Empire was rent into many Factions, the
Chiefs of which were called Heutai: And that at laft the
Family ofSunga rofe to the Empire, and kept it in Pof-
feffion till the Year mcclxviii, when the Tartars
quite fubverted it, and then it was that Marco Polo en-
tered China. It follows then, that in the Year ccxxxvi
of the Hejra, which is in the Year d c c c l i of Chriit ;
and that in the Year cclxiv of the former, which is the
Year d c c c l x x v i i of the latter, and which are the two
chief Dates of our Authors ; the Empire of China was
embroiled by thefe feveral Wars of the Heutai, and from
thefe Factions muft arife the Comparifon Abu Zeid makes
between the Divifion of the Chinefe Monarchy and that
of Alexander, which, however, happens to be as inac-
curate as every thing elfe the Arabs and Perjians write
concerning that great Macedonian. This may be uiffi-
cient to evince that our Authors had been well informed
of thefe great Events, and that they confequently may
claim our Belief, in fome other points, which cannot be.
& happily made out.

What our Authors write of the Government of China,
as being a metropolitan City, or the Capital of a Province^
is diftinguifhed from others, by five Trumpets of extraor-
dinary Size, is not altogether confirmed by our modem
Accounts ; but it is, however, a thing to be found in
ibme Authors, and may, it is likely, have been obferve^
when this Mark of Dignity was in being,

The Drums they relate to h ch City, are

to this Day Eniigns of Diftin -rette writes,

that at Nankin, then the Roys was a Drum

for each Tribunal ; that it is be 1 Magiflrates

to Council ; and that the Drum belonging to the iupreme
Council is covered with the whole Hide of an Elephant,
and that they beat it with a great Piece of Wood which
hangs by Ropes. Martini relates, that before each Go-
vernor's Palace, there are two fmall Towers with mufical
Inftruments and Drums, which are beaten when the Go-
vernor goes out, or comes in, or takes his Seat. Father
Magalhaes fpeaks of that at Pekin, as of unufual Bulk,
being no lefs than thirty fix Foot in Circumference.

All the Cities are fquare, as is obferved by the Fathers
Trigaut, Martini, Navarette, and many others.

Our Author tells us the Governors of the great Ci-
ties are called Difu ; that thofe of the fmaller Towns,
which Father Martini calls Cities, are Tufang ; that the
Eunuchs are titled Tukan, and the fupreme Judge of each
City, La^Jhi-ma-mak-tvan ; and confefs that they know
not how to delineate thefe Titles in Arabian Characters.
How, we find Traces of thefe fame Names in our late
Relations ; for Trigaut calls one of the principal Magi-
flrates Toutam, the fame the Dutch call Tontang, in their
Embafly. Father Martini obferves alfo, that in jfunnan,
there are certain Lords called Tuquon, who are inverted
with an ablblute Power ; and, according to Magalhaes, ■
the Princes of the Province oijunnan, Queichu, £>ua?nji,
and Sutchuen, are called Tuquon or Tufu. The fupreme
Magiflrate of Cities and Provinces is flill called Lip *,
whence, to all appearance, the Arabs formed their Difu>
or Cifu, which is ftill a considerable Dignity.

In the fame modern Writings, we read alfo of Eunuchs
inverted with the mort important. Ports, and particularly
employed to receive the Cuitoms in Cities. Father Mar-
tun mentions him of Nankin, as a great Gmcer; and
Father Trigaut mentions him ofLinJing, who was fent to
receive the King's Revenues, and of another who fu-
perintended the Shipping. Father Diego de Pantoja de-
fcribes the Pomp of the Eunuch Mathan, in a Letter of
his ; and Father Trigaut informs us there is a great Num-
ber of Eunuchs, who are fo made by their own Fathevs ;

of the Tartar Wars, fays, that the Emperor Tianki .

that he ruled the Empire with an arbitrary Authori-
ty, putting to death, and depriving of their Offices all

each Palace, for tkofe who defired to be righted by the
Emperor, or the Sovereign Magiitrate, when they could
not obtain Juftice at the Inferior Tribunals, is grounded
upon a very ancient Cufcom, which is to be feen in I
Father Martini's Life of the Emperor Vvu, who reigned \
mmccvii Years before Cbrift ; "He lent a ready Ear \5Q a J^' d

He adds, that this Emperor one day rofe twice fiQrri

the Bath to give Audience to thofe who requefted it
by thefe Signals. This fame Cuftom itill furvives in
China, according to Father Couplet , who, in his Chro-

P. 4. nological Abridgment fays of this fame King, " He

: " erected a Drum and a Bell at his Palace Gate, at

" the Sound of which he went out to give Audience

4 < to his Subjects, and this fame Cuftom iubiifts to this

defcribed by our Author j for the Infide of their Houfes
is Wood, and they particularly make ufe of the Bam-
loo, or fplit Cane for their Partitions, which they do
over with their Varnifh or Glue Cie, the Compoikion
of which they have hitherto kept to themfelves ; fo
that We cannot be fure our Author is not out, when
he fays they make it of Hemp-feed. Their Houfes,
fays Father Martini, are not magnificent, but they are
more convenient and neat than ours. They are not
fond of feveral Stories, becaufe of the Trouble of get-
ting up Stairs ; and the Emperor of China fell a laugh-
ing, when he was firit fhewn the Plans of the Euro-
pean Palaces, and could not conceive how our Princes

Trig. I 4. did to live in upper Stories. Every Body is in the

/. 403 . lower Part of their Houfes, which is divided into Rooms
and Chambers. The Outiide of their Houfes is but
fparingly adorned, if you except the grand Entrance
and others fmaller in the Front, which are magnificent
in the Houfes of the Wealthy : But the Infide is more
embellifhed; every thing is done over with their precious
Cie, and mines to a wonder, all their Walls being var-
nifh ed therewith. The Houfes are commonly Wood,
and even the Royal Palace is the fame, but the main
Walls are Brick, and ferve to divide the other Rooms
from the Chambers ; for the Roof and Covering is fup-

L ported by wooden Pillars, jufl as Father Trigaut had

' \ ."! laid before in almoft the very fame Words.

The ancient Cuflom of keeping a Watch every Watchmen
Night upon a very lofty Tower, to beat a Drum as to look out
a Signal when they faw Fire break out in any Houle, for Fire.
is a Proof of the dread they have always had of Fires Atlas Sin,
in their great Cities. It is even Death for the Perfon P. 17.
to whole Negligence a Fire is owing, becauie of the
Danger of its ipreading among fo much Wood. Mar- £. 2 .p.
co Polo takes Notice of this lame Cuilom in his De- 476.
fcription of Quinfai, and fays, they there watch every
Night for fear of Fire, becaufe moil of the buildings
are of Wood ; and that the Watch ftrike upon Bafons
[Gonfrs] or great Boards* to give Notice thereof to the
City.

Some Alterations may have happened in their Mar- Marriages.
riages, and we are not exactly informed of their No- Account
tions of Relation or Parentage. Father 'trigaut reports,
they are not very fcrupulous in obferving the Degrees *' **
of Confanguinity on the Mother's fide ; but they are
very cautious of marrying any Perfon that happens to
have their own Surname, tho' in no degree related to
them ; this is obferved by the other Writers, and Fa- p m *$>
ther Couplet has not forgot it in his Abridgment.

In our Authors days there were public Couriers in leve- Couriers _
ral Parts of the Mohammedan Empire. Some of thefe went andHorjes.
on Foot, as the Cuftom ftill is in the Othman [Ottoman] x Account
Empire, where all the Soltan's orders are conveyed by h l T •
Olacs or Footmen, who being fixed at certain Stations,
make incredible dnpatch. The lame there were in
China ; and if we may believe Father Martini, there
are ftill the fame, difpofed at each Stone, a Stone con-
taining ten Chinefe Furlong ., or one of our Leagues, who
forward the Difpatches of the King and Governors.

Moreover, it appears by the Teiiimony of Abu Zeid,
that they had Polt-Hories, or at leaft Mules; for the
word Berid has this fignification, and has for a long
while been very much in ule, to fignify Horfe Poits.
The Arabs made ufe of thefe upon many important
Occafions, juil in the fame manner as in other Places,
but with this difference, that as Pofts were originally
let up for Public Affairs only, they were applied to
no other ufes among the Mohammedans,, and the fame
it was among the Chinefe. Father Martini obferves of

there they are furniftied with Carriages, and every other
Conveniency ; which comes pretty near to the E-veclio
of the Romans.
1. 2. c. 20. Marco Polo fays, that in his time, there were Polls in
China, and that they were fettled from three Miles to
three Miles, which is much the fame Diftance allowed
by Father Martini : that thefe Places were vifited once
every Month, and that the Notaries or Clerks wrote
down the Name of each Meffenger, the Days of their
Departure, and fuch like Cirr urn -lances.
Admini- What is related concerning their Adminiftration of

firation of Juftice, the Severity of their Tribunals, and many other
Juftice. parts of the Chine fe Polity, needs no particular Illuftra-
tion. Thofe who have perufed the Modern Accounts
of China, will perceive that our Arabs are not much
out of the way in what they write of the fame. Ail Bu-
finefs is there tranfadled by Petition, and in Writing ;
and Juftice was feverely adminiftred in former Days, a
notable Inftance of which we have in the Story of the
Khorajfanian Merchant, who demanded and obtained
Juftice againft the Eunuch, though the Emperor's Fa-
vorite.

But it feems that this ancient Severity is ill obferved in

thefe latter times ; for whereas, our Authors affirm,

Robbers were punimed with Death without any hopes

1. 1 . c S. °f Reprieve, Father Trigaut acquaints us, that, in

his time, they were only condemned to the Gallies,

even after many Repetitions of their Crime ; and that

for the firft Commiftion they only branded them with a

hot Iron and Ink.

the Bam- The Punifhment of the Bamhoo was alfo in his time,

hoc. inflicted for the ftighteft Offences, and almoft without

• any Form, quite the Reverfe of the ancient Ufages ;

I. i.e. 9. fc^ our Authors agree with the Moderns, in what regards

the Severity and Manner thereof; and that the Criminal

was beaten upon the Buttocks with great Canes, to fo

Mart.Hift. violent a degree, that it often deprived him of Life. It

&#-P'33jf* was the Emperor Venius, who firft appointed this kind

of PuniUmient, inted of another injinitely more cruel,

of cutting the Criminal into Pieces. And hence, pofli-
bly it is, that our Authors fay, the Chinefe are fuch
as were executed, which we do not read in our modern
Accounts, and feems to be quite inconfiftent with the
Chinefe Politenefs. We are told indeed, by Father Mar-
tini, that the Emprefs Vihia, Wife to Kieu, the Nero of
Chi?ia, who began his Reign 1 8 1 8 Years before Chrift,
ate human Flefh ; but it is unnatural to fuppofe fo deteila-
ble an Example could prevail into a Cuftom, in a Country
fo abundantly productive of every thing good for Food.
Marco Polo, however, relates that in tne Province of 1. 1 . c. 48.
Xandiiy they had this horrid Practice, and that when a
Perfon is fentenced to death, they drefs him and eat his
Elefn ; and fays alfo, that in the Kingdom of Concha, J t l% c ^
they eat the Flefh of thole who die a violent death, and
particularly of their Enemies flain in Battel.

The manner how the Emperor and the Kings or Go-
vernors, who reprefent him, appear in public, is pretty
much like what we are told of the fame by our lateit
Accounts, wherein are many Defcriptions of the Procef-
fion of a Mandarin : His Train is very numerous, and
he is attended by a great number of Officers under Arms.
Firrt he is preceded by fome with large Bamboos, where-,
with they make much fuch a Noife as the Chriltians of
the Levant make with the Boards they ufe inilead of
Bells : Every body muft ftop to do him Honour, and
thofe on Horfeback mult difmount ; nay, according to
Trigaut, every one withdraws into his Houfe. * " Many J. x . c . o.
*' other Enfigns of Dignity there are, fays he, to diitin-
" guifh the Magiftrates; Streamers, Chains, Cenfers,
'• and a numerous Guard, who, by the Noife they make,
" dilperfe the Croud. So great a Veneration do they re-
'' quire, that thefe Noifes are no fooner heard, even in
11 the moil crouded Streets, but every Soul di&ppears,
te every body withdraws. " As for the Emperor and
Viceroys, they agree with all our Travellers, that it is

fetdom they appear in public, and that, not till they have
put their Guards under Arms, and polled them in the
Avenues of the main Streets ; and that formerly they ne-
ver ftirred out but in clofe Litters, of which they carried
many at a time, that it might not be known in which
the Prince rode. This is an ancient Cuftom fince, the
Emperor Hoai fet the firft Example of it, mmxl Years
before Chriit. Na-narette relates of the Emperor, that,

P. 20. * " When he moves they fhut all the Doors in the Streets

" through which he is to pafs, that every body keeps
" within Doors, fo that not a Soul is to be ieen, and
(f that the Perfon who mould mew his Head, would be
" moll feverely chaftifed. "

Jmpofts Our Authors tell us that the Emperor's Revenues pro-

<znd Taxes. vene fr° m * Poll Tax, which is levied only upon Men,
from eighteen Years to eighty, and that, in proportion
to their Wealth : That Salt and Tea pay Duty alfo to
the King, and that Land is unburdened by any Tax.

Atlas Sin. But if you confult Father Martini's Eitimates of what
each Province pays to the Emperor of China, you
will perceive that Matters are very much altered ;
for they each pay very confiderab>le Tributes in Silk,
Cotton, Stuffs, Provifions for his Table, and his Stables.

Mart.Hift. Salt is Hill taxed in part, but Tea is clear ; and this Ga-

Si». belle or Duty mull be of very old Handing, fince King

Venius, who reigned 179 Years before Chrift, took it

L i.e. 3 . ^ '■> but it was foon put on again. Father Trigaut ob-
ferves, that in his time it brought great Sums into the
Imperial Coffers ; but at prefent, according to Navarette %
Commodities pay no Duties, and the main branches of
the Revenue are the Land-Tax, Poll Tax, and the Du-
- ties upon Salt, Silk, Stuffs, and a Tax upon Houfes.

\. I.e. If. He fays the Imperial Revenue exceeds fixty Millions,
clear of all charges ; and Father Martini who defcends
to particulars, runs it up to a higher amount. Thefe Ex-
aggerations were the caufe why Marco Polo was nick-
named Mejfer Marco Milliani, and even fome old Co-

J 9 . 26, P* es °f" ^is Book, are intitled, II Millione. Navarette

talks of above a hundred Millions.

All the Money current in China, is ftill Copper, and Monej*
nearly of the Size of our Liards or Farthings, and fhaped
as our Authors defcribe. The Arabs call them Fa/us,
which fignifies their Copper Money, and is derived from
Follis, which had much the fame Signification in the.
lower Empire. It has a Hole in the middle that it may
be fining, in which manner they make up their Sums,
It is rather a made Metal than Copper, and for Colour
is not unlike our Sols with Cbinefe Characters on one
fide only, that having one fide quite flat, they may be
the more conveniently fining. Thefe Pieces are to be
feen in many Cabinets, and you have a reprefentation of
them, in Tavern iers Travels; but he has made the
Hole round, whereas it ihould be fquare, which is bet-
ter adapted to keep them fteady. In our Second Account
we are told, that a thoufand of thefe Pieces are worth
a Dinar of Gold, which is exactly equal, in Weight, to
the half Piflole of Spain. It appears therefore that the
Arabs, who have always been iubtle Traders, and who
had of this Money at Siraf, kept it down at a very low
Value, and at much lefs than it ought to have been in pro-
portion to the Standard of the Cbinefe Gold and Silver,
as it is now allowed by our Merchants ; the Gold at
forty two Litres per Ounce, and the Silver at fifty nine
Sols, eight Denier;.

Both ancient and modern Authors are agreed upon the
Prohibition, which prevents Gold or Silver from being
coined in China ; and Father Martini, in the Life of Ve- Wfi' ^ lii »
nius, who reigned 179 Years before Chrift, exprefles him- P> 3 2 ^»
felf thus. * " Their Kings have never allowed Gold or

of a noble Prefent fent to Nuroddin by Saladin, foon
after he became Mailer of JEgypt, mention is made
of a Service of China Ware, confifting of forty Pie-
ces.

What is in the fame place faid of their way of treat- Merchants
ing the Merchants they admitted into their Dominions,
is not altogether conformable to the prefent ] Practice ;
but by our laft Accounts, and particularly by the Dutch
Embajjy, we may perceive they have been very cauti-
ous how they fufrered Strangers to enter among them.
Trigaut iniinuates that in his time it was cuftomary to
fend the Emperor whatever was moft curious in the
Country. And their manner of viliting and flopping
the Goods, and even the Preients the Dutch carried with
them intp China, is very agreeable to what we are told
by our two Authors.

As for their Funerals, they are almofl fiill the fame
as formerly. Martini relates that they ftill mourn three
Years for the Death of their Fathers, during which they
abflain from all public Bulinefs, and the Magiflrates
from their Employs. That they exprefs their Grief,
not by the coarfenefs of their Drefs only, but that they al-
fo change their Table Service, their Bed, their Place, their
Food, their manner of writing, their ways of Ipeaking, their
Paper, their Ink, and their Name ; and then they put on
white. They mourn three Years by way of Acknowledg-
ment to their Parents, who adminiitred to all their Wants
and Imbecilities, during the three firil Years of their Infan-
cy, and Father Trigaut has the very fameCuiloms deicribed

their Parents, are very extraordinary ; for they put them
into Coffins of a precious Wood, which fornetimes coft
two thoufand Crowns. They invite all their Relations
and Friends to pay their laft Duties to the departed
Perfon, during the time the Body is in the Coffin, and
expend great Quantities of precious Perfumes, Flowers,
and other different Things, which thofe who come, offer
as a Sacrifice to the Soul of their deceafed Friend or
Relation. They light up Tapers, and they fornetimes
burn rich Stuffs, under a Notion of fending them to the
dead Alan : Ail this muft naturally caufe a vail: Expence,
without reckoning the Funeral Proceifion, when they
have always a great Number of Bonzes, Minftrels 3 and
Mourners.
Writing All the Chinefe can write and read ; this is confirmed

iommm. by the common Concurrence of all Authors, ancient and
modern ; and what is faid afterwards, that all Bufmefs
is transacted in Writing, is, to all Appearance, the chief
Reafon thereof. Martini attributes this to the Emperor
1. 9, p. Sivenius, who began his Reign 73 Years before Chriit,,
,390, and the Reafon he alledges for it, was to the end that

Judges might the more maturely weigh the Cafes
brought before them, and might not be confounded by
the Noife and empty Babble of the Parties concerned.
All Accounts agree in what is faid of the great number
of their public Schools, which is fo much the greater,
as one Mailer cannot inflract above three or four Scho-
lars.
Alms, What our Authors obferve of the Subfiflance the poor

receive from the Emperor's Granaries in times of a ge-
neral Dearth, is very remarkable, and Marco Polo ex-
prefles himfelf in almofl the fame Terms. He fays that
at fuch times, the Emperor claims no dues, but, on the
contrary, adminiilers to the Wants of his Subjects, and
fupplies them with Corn for their Subfiilance, and to
fow their Ground. That to this purpofe the great Khan
in times of Plenty, buys up great Quantities of Corn,
which he keeps in Store-Houfes for three or four Years

together, and that in times of Dearth, he fells it out at
fo low a rate, that he gives four Meafures at a Price,
which would purchafe but one of the fame at Market.

In the fame Author you may read alfo of the very
extraordinary Alms, the great Khan, who was then Em-
peror of China, gave to the Poor, which as Navarette
avers, drew on a Debt, many Millions of which, dp
ilill ly heavy upon die Emperor's Houfehold.

What is faid by our Authors, of their Behaviour to Manner of
foreign Merchants, may have been formerly the cafe, receiving
and their Cuftom of fearching all their Goods, and of Merchants
taking them as a Pledge, is obferved by feveral Writers.
Jofefh Barbara, who met a Tartar from China at the P. \ qy f
Court of Perfia, fays, that the Merchants, immediately
upon their Arrival, carry their Effects to Ware-Houfes,
and thofe, whofe Bufinefs it is, coming to fearch them,
and finding any thing that may be acceptable to the
Prince, take it and pay fpr it in other Goods.

that they begin to be met with at N aiming, in the Pro-

vince of Junttan ; nor is it a wonder that thefe Crea-
tures, who fo fwarm in the Indies, and in Tungkin or
Tonquin, mould ib aggie hither.

All our Travellers report with our Authors, that there
are no Lions in China ; this, Trigaut, Martini, and ma-
ny others, affirm : But as it would be endlefs to infill
upon every particular of this kind, the following Re-
marks fhall be conftned to what our Authors fay of two
very rare and extraordinary Animals, the Unicorn, and
That which yields Musk. **•— — — .

By the Word or Appellative Unicorn, we underftand a ;The Uui~
Creature, which the Arabs, and other Orientals, call 1 corn.
Karkandan, the fame with the Monoceros of the Ancients.
Our Author fays he is much fmaller than the Ele-
phant ; that from the Neck downwards he is not unlike x^^
a Bufflar '; that his Hoof is not cloven ; and that his fore
Legs are all of a piece and jointlefs, which feems incre-
dible, and to contradict what botii Ancients and Moderns ;
have told of his Swiftnefs. He adds that the lowing of
the Unicorn, is between the lowing of the Ox, and the
Cry of the Camel. Now Father Jeronymo Lobo, and
other Jefuits, who have lived fome Years in Ethiopia,
aver they have feen of thefe Creatures in the Province
of Agacs, in the Kingdom of Damota, and defcribe them
to this Effect : This Creature is about as big as a middle-
fized Horfe, of a dark brown, w ith a black Tail and
Main, the Main fhort and thm. They add that in other
parts of this fame Province, they faw others with a thic-
ker and longer Main, and with a ftrait Horn cf five
Palms in length, and of a whitifh call ; and that they
are eternally in the Woods, being very timorous, and
never venturing themfelves abroad in open places. Fa-
ther Lobo relates that many of the Portuguefe had feen
them alfo in Ethiopia, and that from the tops of Rocks,
they difcovered them pamng along in Herds in the Val •

afTures us he faw four Brafs Figures of him in the King

told him this Creature was terrible and untraceable ; and
that when lie was clofely purlued by the Hunters, and
on the brink of falling a Prey to them, he would throw
himfelf down Precipices, and fall upon his Horn, which
Hood all the Shock of the Fall. To this Creature he ap-
plies many paflages in Scripture.

In Anfelm de Booth Treatife, you have the chief of
the Obiervations made upon the Unicorn by the Anci-
ents. He remarks that the Name Motwceros, which cor-
refponds with the Name Unicorn, is common to five dif-
ferent Animals ; the Indian Beeves, defcribed by Pliny j
the Rhinoceros, an Animal of a particular Genus; the
Monoceros of Pliny, of the fize of a Horfe, with the Head
of a Stag, the Feet of an Elephant, and the Tail of a
wild Boar ,- the Indian Afs of the fame Pliny ; and die,
Onx with a fplit Horn, often mentioned by Arifotle,
JElian, and the other Naturalifts.

All thefe feveral Creatures have but one Horn, and
what the curious prefer ve under the Denomination of the
Unicorn's Horn, may be the Spoil of one or other of
thefe kinds ; but to thefe we may alfo add, the Horns
of the Nothern Fifh, called Morfs, which are of ex-
traordinary length 1 and the Horns alfo of the Sea-Cow,
who .ometimes comes to land, and is defcribed by Marti-
ni. Aloft of our modern Writers will have it that the Horns
in our Cabinets are not of the Unicorn, but the Teeth

horned Creatures, rather than the Land. In ds la Pereyre

by Wormius. By them it is demonstrated that thefe Horns
have all the Marks of the Teeth qf a Fifn the Ice-landers
call a Narbual y the fame, perhars, our Author calls a
Wal ; that they are carious at the Root, almoit like rot-
ten Teeth ; and that the Sea throws up great Quantities
of them upon the Shores, a plain Proof that they come
from an Inhabitant of the Water. In the fame Book yon
have a Reprefentation of the Cranium of this Fifh, a
thofe who have treated of Ice-land concur with the Obier-
vations of Wormius. But all this can only prove, that moft
of the Herns fuppoied to come from the Unicorn are the
Spoils of a Fifh, not that there is no fuch Creature as we
have a Notion of when we mention the Unicorn, in Scrip-
ture called Reem ; where alfo he is frequently let forth as
an Animal rare to be ieen, vigorous, and wonderfully fleet
and Itrong. Thus aimoit is it that the Arabs and Per/tans
exprefs themfelves of their Karkandan* Louis Barthema P> 15*^

King of Ethiopia -, Since therefore we havefome credible

feem to want fomething more than bare 1 Conjecture to fa-
tisfy us, with fome of the Moderns, that there never were any
otherUnicorns than the Narhuals ; for this Fifh is as uncom

Thofe who would be more amply informed of what
the Ancients have written concerning the Unicorn, may

his Hierozoicon, as alfo fome Tallages from Arabian
Writers concerning the fame, and particularly from Da-
Tniri, whom he calls Demir, who being but a late Author,

£ 4 REMARKS

Amber, Our 'Authors thought, with fome of the ancief?ts>'

that Ambergreefe grows like a Plant "at the Bot-
tom of the Sea, and that it is thrown on the Shore
by the Swell ; and that pieces of it are to be found in
the Belly of Whales. The oldeft of them having firit ob-
ferved, that among the Maldives they found Lumps
;' of Ambergreefe of extraordinary Size, j adds, that it
; was alfb found in fmaller pieces, almoft in the Form of
Plants torn up ; that in Storms it was forced up from the
Bottom ; that the Wave warned it to the Shore, and that
there it is found in the Form of a Mufhroom or Truffle.
The other fays, that the beft of it is found upon the Coaft
of Barbary, or the Country of Zinge, that is of the Co/res
on the Eaft Coaft of Afrki and even on the Coaft of
Arabia ; That the Negroes train up Camels to go along
fhore with them by Moon-light; That thefe Camels
know the Amber, and when they difcovered any,
bend their Knees, that their Mailer may pick it up ;
Via. Bar- That there is another fort of Ambergreefe, which
bof.p. 313. floats upon the Surface of the Sea ; That a great Filh of
the Whale-kind fwallows it, and immediately dies ; and
that when the Negroes fee him dead upon the Water
they know that he has Amber in him, and that they
go oft to him, and find it in his Belly ; both of them
adding, that the beft Amber is of a whitifn Colour.

Serapion, A<vicen, and others fince them, concur with
the principal Obfervations of our Authors . They fay it
comes from the Sea, but not as a Plant, according to
Avicen, but in Veins, which does not feem at all likely.
He confirms, that Quantities of it are collected on the
Coafts, and that That called Shelaheti is the beft ; this,
in the old Tranflation, being rendered Selachitum, the
learned Garaas de Orta imagined that Ceylon Was thereby
pointed at ; for the Sea is very liberal of this precious
Subitance to that Hand : But it was thus denominated
from the Sea of Shelahet, which, according to our Au-
thors, is beyond Cape Comorin, and divided from the
Sea of Harkand, by thofe great Iflands, which muft be
Java and its Neighbours.
L. 2, <r. The Commentator upon Awicen, cited by P/empius,

233. pitm will have it to grow upon Rocks; Simeon Sethi re-

is miitaken when he adds, that it is found it nti ipeT/-
yii t'oKi cihM^JTov ovoy.aJ^Qfjtyq, In an Indian City
called Selachet ; for, as we have obferved it is the Name
of the Coafl warned by the Sea of Sbelahet. Thefe Paf-
fages in A^uicen and Shrfson Sethi, {hew that the Sea
of Shelahet was not unknown in their Days. The
Town of Arabia the Happy, which he calls ^oy^ov,
is Sichar, where alfo, according to our Authors^ it is
ivafhed on Shore by the Wave.

The Opinion of thofe who believe Amber is found in
Whales, or in other great Fifties of the Cetaceous kind, is*
by moil of the Moderns, rejected ; becaufe there is no Q a rc. de
where lefs Amber found than on the principal Coafts Orl.l.iiC*
of the Whale-Fijhery ; and becaufe the Bafques and the x , Scali^
Bretons, who are almoft always out a Fifhing, confirm J? X erit.
not the Teflimony of the Ancients. Again, by the 264. ri. tal
Directions that have been made of feveral Whales, it is
proved that their Throat is not wide in Proportion to
their Body ; tho' poiTibly Amber may have been found
in fome of the great Fifh of a voracious Nature, as
well as many other foreign Subflances, which they gree-
dily fnap at and fwallow. But this amounts not to
a Proof that they have any particular Guft for Am-
bergreefe, which is by no means a food proper for
them; and it is ftill lels to be fuppofed they would
feek after a Thing that mull prove fatal to them, a ve-
ry Poifon, if true it be, as our Authors take it, that
the Fiih dies upon fwallowing this Amber ; for the na-
tural Inilinft of Animals prompts them to fueh Things
as are good for them, and deters them from fuch as
are hurtful. It is therefore more likely that Amber^
greefe is found naturally in the Sea; that it is not
voided as an Excrement by the Whale or any other
of the cetaceous Tribe ; and that if at any time they
are found to have Amber within them, which at
prefent is very feldom, it mull be confidered as a
mere accident againft the common Gourfe of Nature,
and the Inftinct of Animals.

There are two other Opinions, which carry a

greater Air of Probability, with them, and feem to

confirm each other. The Firfi is that Amber is not

3 Plant at the Bottom of the Sea., but is generated thus 3

REMARKS

Upon the Eaft Coaft of Afric, and in fome Pans of
the Indian Ocean, there are craggy Rocks or Preci-
pices, 'which fwarm with wild Bees, who there make
their Honey in Clefts as in natural Hives. Now they
fay that this Honey, either difTolved by Heat, or
blown away by Winds, or warned down by Rains,
drops into the Sea, where it aflumes a new Form,
and changes its Nature; for that the Saltnefs of the
Sea elaborating the whole Mafs, hardens it, purifies it,
and gives it the agreeable Scent of Amber. That
hence it is it fmells fomewhat like Honey when it
happens to be picked up foon after it comes from
Sea, and that the Spoils of Bees are found in or up-
on it ; and to crown all, this is a pretty generally re-
ceived Opinion among the Inhabitants of the Coafts
moft favored with Prefents of this kind. Thus thinks
Gentius ?l learned Dutchman, who herein agrees with
what other Authors write, as that it comes from Rocks,
or Iflands, and that it is perfected in the Sea.

It is not without Ground that Genfius y s Opinion ap-
pears lb probable to fome of the Learned. The White-
nefs of Amber, inclining to the Grey, borders fome-
what upon the Colour of Honey ; and certain it is, that
the Spoils of Bees and the Bills of fmall Birds which
are fometimes found in Bits of Amber, are far from
weakning this Conjecture. All the Difficulty is how
to conceive, that Bees fhould be able to make Combs
of fuch extraordinary Size as to be equal to fome
Lumps of Amber that have been formerly found upori
the Shore, and even in our own Days. For it is not
very natural to fuppofe that thefe Combs, falling intaf
the Sea, fhould combine into Pieces of fifteen, twenty,
and thirty Pound Weight ; or into Heaps of fuch Bulk
that a fmall Veflel might have been laden therewith j
nay, a Number of Ships, if we can add Faith to the
Report of a French Captain mentioned in the Hiftory
of the EngUJh Royal Society.

Teixeira writes that in the Year 1696. a Piece of
Amber was feen, near Br aw a on the Eaft Coaft of
Afric, of fo unufual a Size, that a Man mounted upon
a Camel could not be difcovered behind it*

A fiiip from Mofambique, once dropped art Anchor
iipon a great Piece of Amber, and the fame Thing
hapned to another near Cape Currents.

The fame Author fpeaks of a Piece of Amber of L. i.e. 28.
twenty Pounds Weight thrown up between the Rivers
Linda and Quilima ; of another warned on Shore upon
the Coaft of Malabar, which the Inhabitants miftak-
ing for Pitch payed their Barks with. Captain Kee- Purch.
ling was told by the Moors at Deli/a, that upon the Vol. I. p.
Coafls cf Monbaca, Magadoxo, Pat a, and Brava, there 193.
were Pieces of Ambergreefe of twenty Quintals.

Tavernier confirms what our Authors advance, fay- Vide. T. 2-
ing, that great Quantities of Ambergreefe are gathered /• 2. c. 23.
on the Coaft of Melinda, and that the Governors of
Mo/ambique negociate it with Goa to the Amount of
great Sums. He relates alfo that it has been found in
Lumps of extraordinary Size, and gives you two In-
ftances thereof, of one that weighed twenty Pounds, and
of another that weighed Forty-two. •

In the Hiftory of Saladin we read that among the
Prefents he fent to Soltan Nuroddin, there were two
Pieces of Ambergreefe, the one of Twenty, the other
of thirty Pound weight. Many Examples we have of
Pieces of Amber of very great Bulk like that found
towards Cape Comorin in the Year mdlv. which weigh-
ed three Thoufand Pound; but what Rabbi David dc DiSl.He*
Pomis advances, that Amber was found in the Jor- brai.
dan, and that it was an Ingredient in the Perfumes of
the old Law, is a meer Fable j for unlefs we grant that
Amber was there found by a Miracle we muft reject
what he fays in this refpecl, efpecially as he has not
the Concurrence of one fingle Author to fupport him.
The Jews fay, that the Word Kifat, in their c Ialmud 9
fignifies an odoriferous Plant, and not Amber, as the

Amber, and moft of them confirm what our Authors
fey ; he reports it to grow at the Bottom of the Sea, jj^a g e g_

longing to a Portuguefe Ship called the St. Thomas, who
was loft in her homeward-bound Paffage, cryed out to
them to throw away what they had picked up, faying
it was a Poifon which dryed up thofe who collected it
fo that they dyed.

Of Musk. Abu Zeid the Author of our fecond Account, is par-
ticular enough in his Defcription of the Creature which
affords Musk. He fays he is like the Roe-buck ; that
his Skin and Colour is the fame ; his Legs flender ;
his Horn fplit and a little bending ; that he has two
fmall white Teeth on each fide, of the Length of half
a Finger, or a little lefs ; that they are ftrait and rife
above the Muzzle of the Creature, almoft like the E-
lephant's Teeth; in fhort, that this it i* that diftin-
guifties him from other Roe-Bucks. This Defcription
does not much vary from what we read in the belt
Authors ; for Avicen fpeaking of Musk* according to
the Tranflation of Plempius, fays, Eft Cyftis feu folli-
culus animalis, ipji caprees non ahfimilis caninos duos
denies Candidas exertos gerentis £sf introrfum reflexos, in-
far cornuum. You have two Reprefentations of this Ani-

r mal, the one in the Fragment of Cofmas, printed in

the firil Volume of Tbevenofs Collection, the other in the
Jccond Volume of Tavemier's Travels. Thefe are
exactly alike, but they differ in two Articles from
the Defcription Ahu-Zeid gives us j for they put no
Horns on the Head of this Creature, and make the
two Teeth which diflinguifh him from the Roe-Buck
to turn downwards, inftead of pointing upwards like
the lower Teeth of the Elephant, according to Abu-
Ziid's Comparifon, in which he is fupported by the
Teftimony of Avicen and Serapion, cited by Matthi-
clus. Marco Polo defcribes the Musk-creature to
this effett; " His Skin is very coarfe like that of
«' the Stag; in his Feet and Tail he refembles the
c< Gazelle, and, like her, has no Horns. He has
.? four Tef th, two ajjoye, fee Fingers long, fcne, and

Barbofa writes, that he neareft refembles the Ga-
zelle, but differs from the others in faying his Coat
is white ; for thefe are his Words ; Musk is found in
fmall white Creatures like Gazelles, with Teeth like an
Elephant hut [mailer. Thefe Creatures are fuhjeSi to a
Kind of Impofthume under the Belly and the Breafi, and
when the Contents are ripened, they are taken with fuch
an Itching, that, for Relief they rub themfelves againft
the Trees, a?id what falls in fmall Drops or Grains is
the mofi perfect and the mofl exquifite Musk.

Thevenofs Defcription is full wider from the reft, he p ar .
writes that in thofe Countries there is a Creature with p j .*
the Muzzle of a Fox, and not bigger than a Hare. For
Colour he is like the Stag, and has Teeth like a Dog ; and
produces the mofi excellent Musk. He has an Excrefcence
or Bladder under the Belly, full of corrupted Blood, and
and it is this Blood which makes Musk, or rather that
is the Musk itfelf They take this from him, and imme-
diately clap a Piece of Leather upon the Mouth of the
Bladder that none of the Scent may evaporate ; but the
Creature dyes foon after this Operation. Antony Piga-
fetta, who fays that Musk is the Cuttings of a. Cat, can-
not be allowed to agree with the reft foregoing.

Father Philip di Marines Defcription is alfb different
from what the others write; for he reports this Crea- Chin. II-
ture to have the Head of a Wolf, and Father Kircher lufir. p.
in the Figure he gives, reprefents him with the Snout 191.

furnifhes him with Claws alfo, whereas he has a clo-
ven Hoof. Simeon Sethi errs {till farther from Truth,
by reprefenting him to be as big as the Unicorn, and
to be even of that Genus or Tribe ; but hear his Words *.
The bafer Sort Musk is that nvhich is brought from the
Indies, nvhich is blackijh ; and the nvorft of all is that
nvhich comes from China. All this Musk is formed in
the Navel of a wry large Creature nvhich has but one.
Horn, and is like the Roe-Buck. In rutting time a Quan-
tity of thick Blood gathers about his Navel, and caufes a>
Tumor, attended ' nvith fuch anguijh that, during the Time,
he can neither eat nor drink. He ronvls himfelf upon the
Ground, and frees himfelf of this Tumor, full of turbid
Blood, nvhich clotting a considerable Time afterwards, a-
quires a good Scent.

All Authors then agree as to the Manner it is for-
med in the Excrefence or Bladder, or in the Tumor
which gathers about the Navel of the Creature in rut-
ting time j and there are few that do not confirm what
is laid of the Way the Chinefe have of fophifticating
it, by mixing therewith the Blood of the Creature, of
fome other Things which debafe the Subilance of it,
or by putting little Bits of Lead into the Bladders or
Cods, that they may weigh the heavier.

It feems that the Musk which runs from the Wound
of the -Creature when he rubs himfelf againft the Stones,
was prized by the Ancients at the higheft Rate, as is
obferved by our Author, Serapian, and fome others.

fectly ripe ; and the Merchants of our times always
make this Dillinclion.

Father Martini fpeaks thereof to this purpofe ; to the Atl. Sin,
End that you may no longer be qt a Lofs to know what pi 58,
Musk is, J will declare what I have more than once feen
with my own Eyes; it is a Lump at the Navel of a
Creature like a Purf 9 made of a very delicate Pellicle, and
covered with very fine Hair. The Chinefe call this
Creature Xe from whence the Word Xahicang, that is
the Odour or fweet Scent of this Creature Xe which
fignifies Musk. He is a Quadruped, and is not very un-
like a little Stag, except that his Coat inclines more to
be black, and that he has no Horns, Teixeira fays,
he is like a Gazelle, and that his Coat is like the Tiger's.

A great Quantity of Musk is found in the Province * uo ^
of Xenfi, at Hangchung, at Cungchang, at Ogueichu in
the Province of Suchuen, in the Province of Junnan,
and in fome others, particularly in thofe conterminous
with Tibet, where thefe Creatures moll abound.

According to our fame Author, the Musk of Tibet
is the mofl exquifite of all ; becaufe of the aromatic
Paftures this Creature finds in Tibet, and not in China.
ProbatiJ/imus lay Avicen, Ji regionem fpecles, eft Tebe-
tius, five Tumbafcinus, that is, the Country of Turn-
gage which the Arabs take to be a Province of China.
Simeon Sethi for want of underftanding the Geography
of thefe diftant Parts, fays that the bell Musk is tha^
which comes from a City a great Way to the Eaft-
ward of Choraffan and called Toupat. A Greek Au-
thor, cited by Lambecius, calls it reiTrdr j for thus is it
the Orientals commonly pronounce what we write Ti-

has read t£ ttat, and writes that the befl Musk is
called Pat. Serapion obferves alfo that the bell Musk
is from Tibet, for the very fame Reafons already alledged.

All the Ancients then and Moderns agree, that the
mod exquifite Musk is that of Tibet, or as others call it
Tumgage ; and this becaufe of the Aromatic Paftures in
that Land, fuch as are no where elfe to be found. Tha$

With it by Land from China, and d : fper r ed it all overt
the Eaft. That the Chinefe Musk is the worft of all, not
only becaufe the Chinefe adulterate it feveral ways, but
alfo becaufe what is produced naturally in that Kingdom,
is not comparable to what is in Tibet. All this is con-
firmed by the Teftimony of the learned Gokus, and Fa-
ther Martini. Teixeira fays, the Musk that does
not come from China, is always the belt ; and that the
reafon is, becaufe no llega a las manos de los Chinas,
cuiyo animo no fufre dexar alguna cofa en fit fureza.

At prefent the Kingdom of Bout an is the greateft Mart
for Musk: This muft have been a part of the ancient
Tibet, or Country fubjedl to the Khan of Tibet, and
thence it is that the Indian Merchants fetch the beft fort
of this Perfume, whether in the Bladder or Cod, or out
of it.

Tea, Our Author is the oldeft and aim oft the only Arab that

mentions the Chinefe Drink, fo univerfal in our Days
over Europe, and known by the Name of Tea. But this
is not the Name he gives it; for he calls it Cba, which
comes nearer to the true Chinefe Name, Ghah or Chaw,
than the Name we have for it. He fays that it is an
Herb or Shrub, more biflfhy than the Pomegranate-Tree,
of a more taking Scent, but fomewhat bitter to the Tafte.
That the Chinefe boil Water and pour it fcalding hot
upon this Leaf, and that this Infuflon preferves them
from all Diftempers. This, we own, is an imperfect De-
fcription, but is plain enough to evince that nothing can
hereby be meant but the Plant we know by the Name
of Tea, the fame with the TchaCatayi, or Sini of the Ori-
entals. The Tree which bears this Leaf is but fmall,
and muft be claffed with Shrubs, being no bigger
than a fmall Pomegranate Bum; and even the Leaf of
the one and the other are not much unlike. It has a
plea&mt kind of a violet Scent, is bitter to the Tafte, and it
is common for thofe who are fond of it, to imagine it does
them good, and keeps them in Health. It is certain then,

I I , p. I g. that Father Trigaut is miftaken when he imagines it is
but of late date among the Chinefe, becaufe there is not,
as he fays, any Character in their Tongue to fignify this
Drink ; for by the Teftimony of the oldeft of our Au-
thors, who does not fpeak of it as any new thing, but
as an Herb very much in vogue with thenr, nay, to that

degree,

jdegree, that the Emperor thought fit to lay a Duty upon
it, and to referve all the Profits of it to himfelf ; by this
Teftimony I fay, it appears that the Chinefe have
been addi&ed to it above eight hundred Years ; nor is it
poffible to believe with William Pifo, that it grew a long
time wild and uncultivated, or that the Chinefe and J a-
panefe have been but lately acquainted with its Vertues
and the manner of preparing it, and with all the Advan-
tages it is of, Advantages which are difcovered daily
more and more. This he fays he was told by fome
Dutch Commanders, who had been a long time in the '
Country.

Father Martini, who has written more accurately of
China that any other Perfon whatfoever, has no fuch Ob-
fervations upon the ufe of this Leaf, which mull make
the reft look very fufpicious and doubtful. He fays it
grows particularly in the Province of Kiangnan or Nan-
kin, where the beft of it Is. It is, adds he, a fmall
Leaf perfectly like that of the Rhus Coriarius, or Su-
mac of the Curriers. I believe it is even of the fame
kind therewith ; however, it grows not wild, but is do-
meftic and cultivated : Nor is it a Tree but a Shrub
which fpreads out in little Branches, with a BlofTom very-
much like that of the Sumac, except that the former in-
clines more to be yellow than the latter. It blows firft
in Summer, when it emits no great Scent, then follows a
Berry which is firfl green, and aftewards blackifh. In the
Spring it is that they gather the Leaf to make their Cha,
for then it is the moil fucculent and tender. The Pre-
paration of thefe Leaves coniiils in gathering them, dry-
ing them by a flow Fire, rolling them upon a Cot-
ton Mattrefs, and in packing fhem up in Tin Chefts or
Boxes, for the fake of preferving them, and the con-
venience of tranfporting them. This Defcription does
not exactly fquare with that of Father Alexander de
Rhodes, and Father di Marini, in their Accounts of
Tonquin, and ftill lefs with thofe of James Bont, and
William Pifo, in his Additions to the fifth Book of his
Hiftory ; for he relates from what he was informed by
$he Sieur Caron, who was a coniiderable time in China,
and Japan ; That this Plant grows no where but in Chi-
fia, Japan, and Siam, fprouting up to about the Height of
fhe Rofe-Bu/b of Europe. That the Stem and all the

REMARKS

Branches are covered with Bloffoms, and little peeked
Leaves indented all round, all in the fame form, but of
different fixe , fd that they are of five different forts. The
greatejl grow on the lower Branches, whence they dimi-
nifh upward to the very top of the Bujh. The fmaller
the Leaves are the more they are worth ; fo that a Pound
of the largeji fhall fell but for five Pence, while that
of the fecond fixe fhall be worth fifty, thofe of the
third fixe five Florins, of the fourth fixe, fifteen, and the
fifth and le aft fixe of them, fhall fell from one hundred
■ to one hundred and fifty Florins the Pound. The fame
Author has it, that the Bloflbm of this Tree is white, and
not unlike to the Eglantine, except that it has a different
Scent. But it were a fruitlefs Task to infert other De-
fcriptions on this head, which vary from thefe. This
Leaf is now fo well known in Europe, that we may
judge for our felves, that it bears no likenefs to the Eu^
ropean Sumac, whofe Leaf and Flower are extremely
different. The feveral fizes of this Leaf according to
which the Price is regulated, are by no means peculiar to
this Shrub : but the difference of the Value is according
to the time when it is gathered, whether when it firlt
fprouts out, or after it has been fome time upon the Stalk.
Of the budding Leaf is the moft exquifite Tea made, ve-
ry little of which comes to us in Europe ; the Flower is
what is moft univerfally efteemed, and is properly the
Chaw. The fmenefs of Tea diminimes as the Leaf
grows bigger arid bigger, and alfo according as it is ga-
thered in Seafon, or out of Seafon. It may be obferved
alfo, that as Tea grows not only in China, but in Ja-
pan, Tonquin, and even in the Kingdom of Siam, it is
natural for Merchants to purchafe at the cheapeft Mar-
kets, whence we have but little of it that is really fine.
Now, as the Chinefe, J ' apanefe, and even feveral Na^
tions of the Levant, not to mention the Europeans, make
a great Confumption of Tea ; they, it is probable, keep
the bell for themfelves, which is very dear even in China
itfelf, and as it eafily jofes its Flavor upon the leaft Acci-
dent, the Merchants muft be unwilling to run the Rifque
of tranfporting it, except they are fure of turning it to a
good Account. Molt of them, therefore, buy it at Ja-
pan, where the Dutch have exported great Quantities;
£ut ill Japan it is not comparable to what grows in the.

What our Travellers report of the Coco-Nut Tree, is Coco-Nut

de B arras, and in many others . They all declare that t * *'
this Tree alone, affords wherewithal to build a Ship, $' ' '*
and to lade her when fhe is finifhed. The Trunk fup-
plies them with Plank, Marts, Anchors, and Oars; the
.Fibres about the Nut itfelf, make a very valuable Cor-
dage, becaufe it never perilhes in the Water. The
Anchors made of the Wood of this Tree, are well enough
for fmall Craft. TheNut itfelf affords a fweet, pleafant and
milky Liquor, which, fermenting, becomes a Wine, a
Vinegar, a Sugar, and even a kind of Brandy : Its Oil
is fovereign in cafes of the Erysipelas or St. Anthonfs Fire,
Tetters, and many other Ailments. In fine, this Tree
alone fupplies with Food, Habitation, Cloathing, and
Commodities to export, if true it be, that the chief Trade
of the Maldives is in the Articles they reap from the
Coco-Nut. The Arabs call both the Nut and the Tree

word ufed by Cofmas the Monk, in his Topography.

Thofe who firft attempted this obfcure q> he ^
Point, have,upon a very fufpicious Foundati- monof thofe
on, advanced that theApoftle St.Thomas hav- who believe

ferred it thence into China. Father Tri- "^Jj^£
gaut who wrought on the Memoirs of Fa-
ther Matthew Ricci one of the firft Mif-
fionaries that went to China, ftarted this
Notion from a Paflage in the Beit Gaza,
or Breviary of the Syrian Churches, where
are thefe Words ; By St. Thomas the Er~
ror of Idolatry has been confounded in the
Indies. By St. Thomas the Chinefe and
Ethiopians have been converted to the Know-

another Authority, taken from a Collecti-

turned again into the Indies, where, accor-*

to be doubted, and as the Light of the

fufficient to derive on him thofe Praifes in

the Indians were perfeSly acquainted with
China, whither almoft all of them fent fume
Kind of tribute, It is then very probable that
this Apojlle, who had this new World in
charge j would not have neglecled the finefi
Part of it, at that lime as renowned in
the Eaft as Italy was in Europe when the
Roman Empire was in its Meridian. There-
fore it may have been that he travelled thither
in Perform or, at leafi, that he fent Jome of his
Difciples thither. Uhis Conjecture, which has
all the Strength of an authentic Proof has
received an additional Force, from what has
been remarked in the Chinefe Hijiory of thofe
Times , for it declares that a certain Man
came into China and taught d heavenly Do-
Urine ; he was not, according to the fame,
an ordinary or common Man*, his Life, his
Miracles, and his Vertues, attratled him the
Admiration of all that knew him.

It is true, indeed, the common Tra- q% e <f r a-

Tradition is not altogether certain, it
neverthelefs carries fome air of Authority
with it, inafmuch as the Name of San
Thome ; which is impofed on the City of
Meliapor, has, for many Ages part, been
known not only among the Europeans, but
alfo among the Arabs, both Chrifiian and
Mohammedan. For our two Authors fpeak
of Betuma or Batuma, as of a Place known:
upon the Indian Shores, and this Word
fignifies the fame with Beit-Thoma, the
Houfc or Churchy of St. Thomas, juft as the'
Arabs and Sprians write and pronounce
Bazbadi for Beitzabdi, Bagarmi for Beit->

told that this Apoftle reached China, and
fuch Points of Antiquity are not to be
afcertained by Probability, when back-
ed by no pofitive Authority ; for by this
Rule of Conjecture a Portuguefe Writer
has taken on him to prove that the fame
Apoftle croiled over to America, and par-
ticularly that he was in Brafil, a Thing
no Body had ever thought of before.

We are to the full as unwilling to
grant what the Author of the Memoirs
fo politively ailerts, namely, that the In~
dians who were taught by St. Thomas, and
who were of Malabar, were perfe&ly ac-
quainted with China, or, confequently, that
they were Tributaries to that Country;

for we are quite ignorant of the Hiftory
of thofe Countries. But what is infinitely
more probable, and what the Chinefe them-
felves acknowledge, and what our two
Authors and almoft all the Arabs joint-
ly confirm, is that the Chinefe had their I-
dolatry, and their Doctrine of Tranfmi-
gration from the Indians, with almoft all
the Superftitions which prevail among the
Bonzes and among the People. So that
this Conjecture has not even Probabi-
lity for Foundation; ' wherefore its Au-
thor reduces it to a bare Poffibility • per~
baps he went thither himfetf^ which is not a
whit more likely to have hapned. For
the Life of Man had been unequalto fuch
long Traverfes, almoft without Refpite £
nor would have allowed of the Delays ne-
cefiary to catechife fuch Numbers of Nati-
ons and Tribes, to found Churches fufficient,
and to go through all the other painful
Functions of the Apoftolat, which muft
have required St. Thomas to fojourn a very
confiderable Time among them.

Now tho' we could difcover any Pafc <z% e QhU
fage, in theHiftory of China, to favor this nefe Hi-
Notion, it would be but of little Weight; pry fays
but, quite to the contrary, Father Couplet has n ° th ™ g h ?

*4 ORIGIN of the

and Interpretation of the Syriac ; for mi£*
taking a Word which fignified Priefi,
and ftarting another which fignified £-
thiopian, he pretends to difcover a Miffion
oi Coptic and Ethiopian Priefts,. a Notion of
the wildeft fort. For they would have
made ufe of their own Languages in this In-
fcription, or, at leaft, of one of them, feeing
they are fo diftant from each other ; and
not of the Syriac, which was foreign to
both. Again, neither Copts nor Ethiopians,
who are Jacobites, would have preached up
Jsfefioriamfm, which they abominate* and
nothing is more certain than that all the
Chriftians, for manyAges, in the Indies and
the Upper Afia, have been Nefiorians. Fa-
ther Kircher alfo is miffcaken upon the
Word Patriarch in the Syriac Infcription^
and leaves his Reader in the dark, unable
to determin whether it ihpuld be the Pa-
triarch of Alexandria, or the Patriarch of
Antioch, when it happens to be neither the
one nor the other.
<fte Second When the fame Father publifhes his China
Explication Ilkfirata, he makes mention of Ethiopians
Kircher only ; but his Tranflation, tho' different
has given, f ro m the former, is not at all more con-

tv the Kings of China, in the time of the Fa-
ther of Fathers, Hananjafhuah, Catholic
Patriarch. Father Kircher, in his flrft Ver-
iion, renders it, Dominus Ifdbuzad Sacerdos ■
& Archiepifcopas , in his China Illaftrata ; Sa-
cerdos y Vicarhis Epifcopi Cumdan ; and in a
third Verlion Sacerdos & Vicarius Epifcopus*
Other Words he read wrong, as Beleh for
Balky Hahurflan for Tokareftan ; and of the
Word which rlgnifies a Stone, he makes
Papa, incoherently tranflating it, erexit
banc tabulam Papa. He would have it alfo,
that Hananjafhuah is Johannes Jofue, and that
by the Title 'Catholic we are to underftand the
Patriarch of Alexandria^ or him of Antioch,
or him of Babylon , by whom he imagins
this Title was peculiarly affected, and fo
he leaves this Point undecided • tho* if
the Prieffe who erected this Monument,
acknowledged the Patriarch of Alexandria,
who never was ftyled Catholic, they were
either Orthodox if the Patriarch was the
Greek ; or Jacobites, if he was the Coptic ;
or if him of Babyhn, they were Neftorians j-
and this is all the Light he reflects upon
this Obfcurity. Mailer, who examined this
Infer iption, had no Fault to find with the
Yerfion, and adds nothing but Commen-
dations on the Author; tho* it requires no-
thing but a tolerable Skill in Latin to per-
ceive that many PafTages of the Tranfla-

of this in- correfponds with the Year MXCII of the

fcrtyion. Greeks or Seleucid^e, and that Father Kir*

chcr, who makes it the Year of the fame

MLXXXII. is ten Years out in his Ao

count. He that fpeaks, was originally a

Prieft of, or, at leart, came from Balk, a

famous City , which many Geographers

place in Tokarefian, or in Turkeftan, two

Names, tho' often confounded together,

belonging to two diftincl: Provinces. He

was at that time Chorepifcopus of Cumdan t

the principal City of the Eaftern Kingdom, or

of the Eaftem Court. The Chorepifcopi are

very well known in the Eaftern Church,

who has feveral Offices for their Confer

cration ; and the Word being diftin&ly

exprerled in the Table, it is hard to con-*

ceive why Fath. Kircher tranflated it either

Archbijhcp or Bifhop's Vicar.

What we , Cumdan is certainly Nankin, at that time

*?rc to un-' the imperial Seat of China, as well as when

de *fi" nd ty our two Arabs were in the Country. This

Cumdan ^f ^ as ^ ac ^ feveral Names, as Father

Martini obferves ; the Arabs called it Gum*

dan, as appears by Yacuti, Ebn Wardi, and

Nut>f aP ^ Nubian Geographer tho* fcarce to be

known in the Latin Tranilation. For the

Maronites, who undertook that Work, fo

unequal to their Strength, imagined Cum

dan to be the Name of a River, whereas

the JCiang is meant, which the Author fu£-

ficiently gives us to understand, faying,

It is the Urgefi River in China, and calling Ebn War-
it the River of Cumdan, becaufe it paffes dl » Yaci *ti.
through that City, This Name is fo very of-
ten repeated in the one Account and in the
other, that we can have no Doubt concern-
ij, and efpecially as we find it in the old
Arabian Geographers* For, if Abulfed-a r
and fome other Authors mention it not,
but have a different Name for the Capital
of this Empire, and cannot even fettle up»
on that among themfelves ; it is becaufe
they wrote after the Throne was tranflatedl
to Pekin* They fay Nankin fignifies the
Southern Court) and in the Syriac Infcrip-
' tation Cumdan is called the Eaftern Court ;
the reafon is plain, for, to thofe who came
from Mefepotamia, Nankin was not only the
molt diftant, but the moft Eafterly alfo.

The Catholic Patriarch, Hananjajhuah y was Wlowas
certainly the Patriarch of the Neftorians } as faCaihollc
may be proved by Hiftory, which has two T at rmvch
Patriarchs fo called; the firft confecrated f ff* /w ~
about the Year of Chrift DCLXXXVI: fcr * tm '
thefecond about the Year DCCLXXIV.
Now the Infcription was cut in the Year
DCCLXXXII, and, confequently, in the
Life-time of this l.aft, or afhort time after,
if, as the fame Hiftory records, he fat but
a little more than four Years. We fhajl
however take a time profeffedly to demon-*
Urate that the Date of his Confecration
.ought to be put fome Years backward j
but tho' two or three were wanting to
make it quadrate with this Infcription,
it would no; at all lofe of its. authenticity;

are of very different: Meaning; it was in
the Days of Juftinian, that they began to
give the Title of Catholic to thofe Prelates
who were fuperior in Dignity to Me-

feveral of them, and might confecrate

ceeded, and diverting them of their Autho-
rity, under the Countenance of the laitKings
of Perfidy arrogated to themfelves the Style
of Catholic, and have kept it ever finoe,
adding Patriarch thereto, as they were the
Heads of all the Nefiorian Communion.
From this fame Word the Arabs have for-
med their Jatelik, the two Letters being the

while Marco Polo, conforming to the Vene~
tian Pronunciation, has exprefTed it by Z<#-

the Nefiorian Patriarchs, that the Jacobites,
out of Hatred to them, tho* they themfelves
had real Catholics in their own Church,
have for five hundred Years paft given them
the Title of Mofrian.

fen ; tho', by the way, it is hard to conceive
how a Man that has never been out of Ea->
rope, fhould be able to play the Critic upon
a Chinefe Infer iption, only by the Help of a
few Lexicons ; to have done with this, we
will take notice of what is molt eflential in
each Column,

The firfl lays down the Ground-work of fkefrft
the Chrifiian Faith, the Exigence of a God- ^^
head, in three Perfons, Creator of all ^garAu
Things. It is remarkable that thefe Syrians the Exi-
ufe the word Alohoj which they, moft cer- ftence and
tainly, did becaufe they could find no Name of
word in the Chinefe Tongue to convey the
Idea the Chriftians have of the true God ;
But Midler^ who fancies he knows more
than any body finds you out four others, ■
which he pretends will anfwer the end,
For we mufi not imaging fays he, the Chi-
nefe have no adequate Name to Jignify God y
tho* they have not the ineffable Name of Je<-
hovah. And yet Ricci, Martini and many
others were of a contrary Opinion, while
thofe, of our Days, who fide with Mutter^
have not been able to prove what they fay.
His turn upon the ineffable Name is quite
puerile ; for without knowing the Pronun-



ciation it may have had among the Hebrews ,

we have, through Mercy, an Idea of

the Sovereign Entity. It is aftonifhing,

.That after fo many learned Men, even Pro- Capcll.de

. Now for the Remark he afterwards makes
upon the Name of God expreffed in Syriac y
and which he modeftly offers as a Conjecture:
It is likely then, fays he, the Author of the
Infer iption was of a Church that [poke Syriac.
Nothing in the World more certain j and
hence it might naturally have been inferred
that the Patriarch, therein mentioned, could
never have been him of 'Alexandria* But the
date, and fo many Syrian Names might
equally have convinced him, not only that
the Church of this Clergy, that is, of the
Chrirtians of the Country, fpoke Syriac, but
that it was alfo the facred Language in
which they celebrated divine Service, and
drew up their Eccleliallical Writings.
Ofthefe- The fecond and third Column continue
condand to explain the Myrlery of the Creation, the

w C °" fal1 of t} ? e firft ^ an b ^ the Sedua:ion of

dark, ,let us fee how the Interpreters have
commented thereupon: ut lex & prophetic

we lay hold on it to fhew how little we
are to depend upon Veriions from the Chi*
nefe Writings \ tor this Diverfity may
produce very different Meanings, and
no one can be fond of fo odd an In-
terpretation. This number of twenty four

Prophets

Prophets is equally unknown to the Syn&*
gogue and to the Church, as well as that of
the twice twelve Prophecies, nor ever did
any Man name among the Prophets the Per-
rons Kircher has introduced.
tfhetme It is eafy to perceive that by the Com-
Exptkatkn pletion of the Prophecies, or of what the
cftbis Paf- Prophets foretold, thefe Syrians underftood
Mulled the Predidions in the Old. Teftament : -this
Mifiafa. is evident by what follows of the twenty
feven Books the Apoftles left behind them>
which make up the New Teftament ; and
fo the number of twenty four muft relate
to the Books of the Old. The Syrians,
whether Orthodox, Jacobite, or Neftorian,
have their Verfion from the Hebrew Text^
which contains twenty four Books, com-
monly by the Jews called the Twenty
four. This is the mighty Myftery our
Critic could not unfold • at the fame
time that he is mightilydifturbed at the twen-
ty feven Books of the New Teftament, be-
caufe, truly, Kircher reckons fourteen Epiftles
of St. Paul*, for my part, fays Muller, lean
make out but thirteen, and there is fome
doubt concerning that to the Hebrews. We
very well know the Lutherans make
a doubt of it, but the Syrians and all the
other Eaftern Chriftians are fatisned it is
canonical, as appears not dnly by their Co^-
pies of the New Teftament, but alfo by the
Enumeration their Divines and Canonifts

was but ill qualified to talk of the Reli-
gion of the Orientals.

In the iixth Column mention is made of the
of Baptifm, which cleanfing the Body fi 'xth Co~
purifies the Soul . and then according to lumu
the Tranflation word for word; Difperfi in ' .

quatuor partes mundi ; we are not fure whe-
ther thefe words have reference to the A-
poitles or to the whole Body of Chriftians j
but it is moft likely they are meant of thefe
laft, by what follows; Ad congregandos & pa-
cificandos fine labors pulfant ligna y timoris,
pktatisj gratitudinifque voces perfonando. Here
we have an inftance of the Imperfection
of the Cbinefe Tongue; for very able Tran-
slators have been at a lofs to determin, whe-
ther thefe Words , relate to the preceding,
or to the fucceeding. But it is beyond Dii-
pute that they intend the Ceremonies of the
Chriftians, by this time in fubjedion to the
Mohammedans^ as they were in the Days of
Hananjashuabfeeing he was appointed by the
Kalif Mahadi, who dyed in the Year of the.
J%VaCLXIX, andoton/DCCLXXXV.
At this time the Chriftians were not allow-
ed the ufe of Bells, but were obliged, a$
they are at prefent, to ftrike upon wooden
Inftrnments inftead thereof- and this is
moil: likely to be Senfe of the Cbinefi
Words.

But Muller difcovers a more exalted MullerV
Meaning ; he will have it that Mo y which Cwj&***

fancy they have acquired the Chinefe Lan-
guage by poring in their Clofets, deferve
not to be heard in opposition to fuch cf
the Learned as have patiently and painfully

To fay no more of this, I would ask if
any Chriftian, in any Language whatfoever,
has made ufe of an Expreffion like
that of beating or ftriking upon the De<ail y
with a view to the Exorcifms of Baptifm.

I do not find, continues he, that they made
Ufe of the Word Sacrifice, or that they believed
they offered the real Body and Blood of Jefus
Chriit,* into which the Bread of the Eucharift
was converted by Tranfubftantiation. If this
Infcription had been a Theological Tract
in form, we might have required it to be
more explicit and circumftantial, as well
upon this Head as upon all the reft ; the
Matter is, what the Syrian Clergy believed
concerning this Sacrifice. Fath. Kircher
had cited three or four Oriental Paiiages
from Ecchellenfis, to prove thefe Chriftians
believed a real Mutation of the Bread and
Wine into the Body and Blood of Jefus
Chnft : But Midler cannot difcover either
the Sacrifice without Blood, or Tranfubftan-*
tiation in the Chmefe Tongue, adding, That
he cannot perceive this Do&rin to have
been authorifed by Liturgies, or by the
Teftimonies exhibited by Kircher. And
yet there are above fifty Oriental Liturgies,-
not to mention other Books of public
Devotion, where the Term of the Sacrifice
without Blood, is often and often repeated *
but we do not there meet with Tranfubftan-
tiation; by the fame Rule it may be proved,
that the Roman Church difclaims it; for
the exprefs Term is no where in the Ca-
non of the Mafs. To be plain, it is evi-

But to return to the Infcription, it alone We have
\r \ acquaints us, that fo early as the Year no Jutho-
f)V ;;! DCXXXVI. the Gofpel had been preach- ft *"-
ed hi China, by Priefts from Syria, whofe /J^_
Chief was Olopaen. This is all we know feripticn
of the Matter -, the Chinefe Hiftory has no itfelf.
Words concerning it, and it is no hard
Matter to perceive, that this Name is
Chinefe, and that it was impofed on this
Preacher of the Word, as the Curtom ftill
is in our Days, for all thofe who go to
China to receive new Names. Mailer, full
of his Conjectures, fancies thefe Preachers
were Chriftians of Perfia, who fled the Per-
secution of the Arabs*, but long before,

and in the Upper Afia, protected by the laft
Kings ; and no fooner was Perjia conquered,
than the Nefrorians, who were almoil the
only Chriitians of that Country, obtained
very ample Privileges at the Hands of the
Kalif Omar, together with the free and
entire Exercife of their Religion, all which
is exprefly recorded in Hiftory.

It muft be confefled then, that we are
furnifned with no Light in Arabian, Syrian,
or Chwefe Authors, to ihew us who this
Okptten may have been ; we can only fay
that he entered China in the Seventh Cen-
tury. He cannot then have been St. Tho~
mas, as fome have thought : And yet Kir<-
cher and many others, account it an indubi-*
table Facl:, That this Apoftle beamed out
the Rays of the Gofpel there, after he had
preached in the Indies. This Father has
even traced out the Track he muft have
followed in his Journey thither from the
Indies ; but his Notions as to this Matter are
quite intolerable, and can never be brought
to quadrate with the Geography of thofe
Parts.

In the firft Place, he brings St. Fhomas
to a Town of Perjia, called Soldania or Sol-

No Arabian Geographer or Perfian, has
taken Notice of this Town, fo that Kircber
for this depends only on the Authority of
Benet Goez a Brother Jefuit, who came by
Land from China to the Indies ; but by the
Manner of fpelling this Name, as it ftands
in the China Illuftrata, it feems evident that
this Cafmfian is owing to a Miftake in read-
ing the Name of the Province of Curiftan,
or Cuzifian, which is a Part of the ancient
Stifiana, which was ufually croiled by the
Merchants of Mefopotamia and Perfia, who
went by Land to Tibet. The Matter, how-
ever, was not to exhibit a Diary of St. Tho-
mas's Travels this Way, tho' the Road
pricked down, had been as plaufible as this
is not.

All the Proofs hitherto offered to per-
fuade us St. Thomas preached in China, are
founded upon mere Conjecture only, where-
as this Monument, whofe Authority cannot
well be contefted,afiures us, the firit Know-
ledge the Chinefe had of the Evangelic
Faith, was not before the VII Century;
nor is there the leait Footftep of the
contrary in Ecclefiaftical Antiquity. It
remains now, that we enquire who thefe
firft Miffionaries may have been, a Point
as yet not fufficiently cleared up.

The Obfervations already made upon the tfhU firfi
Syrian Words, at once declare, that this -" ji ^ ton $

feeing they call them their Fathers ', and that
they profeiied. Obedience to the Catholic,
and that his Name was Hananjajhuah.

Again, there is not the leaft Room to
imagin theie nrft Preachers were not Sy-
rians, feeing that the Date which is as the
Seal of what is contained in the Infcrip*
tion, as alfo the Signatures, which have an
abfolute Affinipy with thofe ftill in Ufe with
the Eaftern Churches in all Writings of
Record, are in the Syrian Tongue, the
holy Language, wherein they celebrated
Divine Service, and tranfacled all Church
Matters. If the Priefts and others mentkv
ned in the Body of the Infcription had
been of Egypt, the Date and their Names
had been written in Greek, or in Coptic.
They were then of the fame Church with
the firffc Preachers, and fubordinate to the
fame Patriarchs, a Thing of the plaineft
Vifibility, feeing they looked on their Prer
deceflbrs as their Fathers.

In former times there were Syrians of
different Se&s, as at this day, Melchites,
or Orthodox, Nefiorians, and Jacobites : Now
if we can difcover the Seet of the Perfon
ftyled Patriarch, we fhall be infallibly
guided to the Communion of the Clergy
who acknowledged him their Superior.
The very Title therefore of Catholic, to
which Patriarch is annexed, is a demon-
ftrative Proof, that he was the Catholic
of the Neftcrians* who was Patriach in re?

fpe& of them, as being fubordinate to no
other; and the rather, as neither the Pa-
triarch of Antiocby nor him of Alexandria
ever ailumed the Style of Catholic. But the
difpute is inconteftably decided by the Te-
stimony of the Neftorian Church her felf,
who acknowledges an Hananjajhuab among
her Catholics, or Patriarchs, and declares
he lived about the time this Monument
was erected. Several of the Names which
fill up the Margins of the Stone, are com-
pounded of two Words, a Cuftom more
prevalent among the Syrians of Mefopota-
mia y and the Nefioriansj than with any of
the reft ; and this added to the Arguments
before offered, confirms thefe Preachers
to have been of their Communion. And
what ftill proves it more and more, is
the manner of explaining the Myftery of
the Incarnation • for through the Clouds
of the Chinefe Style, we dilcern the Doc-
trin of this Seft, which admits the Union
but by the Inhabitation of the Word, and
the Communication of his Dignity and in^
finite Power.

This is all we learn from the Syriac In- _* c , „
fcription; but the Cbinefe Words contain n J c p a lt
a more minute Detail of the Progrefs of of the in-
this Million. It is there faid that this O/0- ftrfchi

the Root it took over the whole Empire,

that the Chinefe Hiftory, and that alfo of

upon this Head : Wherefore we are reduced
to the Neceffity of wholly relying on the
Incifion upon the Chinefe Stone • but par-

but that, in Conformity to the common
Difciplin of all Chriilians, the Catholics

the ufual Hierarchy, fending one or feveral
Bifhops thither, without which, this infant
Church could not fo long have fubfifted ;

are moft of the reft. The Order theie Me-
tropolitans Hand in, feems at firft to be con-
futed } and it might be thought, they are
not named according to the Rank they
held • in the Church. For the Metro-
politan of Jerufalem is but the twenty-
fecond, tho* there are but twenty-four in
all, which is contrary to the Ufage of o-
ther Churches, and to the Canons of the
Council of Nice, which dignifies him
next after the four Patriarchs. And hence
is it that he, for many Ages, has been con-
iidered as the fifth Patriarch in the Greek
Church, and in the Latin; tho' the fame
was not allowed him by the Coptic Church
of Alexandria. But it may be readily un-
derftood that this Order, the Neftorian Me-
tropolitans ftand in, was not regulated by
the Dignity, but the Antiquity of each.
Now this Antiquity was not deduced from
the Rank thefe Metropolitan Cities may
have enjoyed under the Chriftian Empe-
rors j for in thofe Days they were fcarce
known, and deftitute of Bifhops, nay,
fome of them were not built.
tfhey eveB The Neftorians then erected a new Hier-
a ww archy, whofe general Metropolis, and, as
Hierarchy. j t w ' ere) trie Capital of their Patriarchat
was Seleitcia of the Parisians, and Ctcfi-

Neftorians there fettled, and role to great <ri$fl<§T
Authority under Ofrces Nujhirowan^ who r i» un-
protected them in Opposition to the Greek ^ 0*-
Emperors, and compelled the other Chri- ~^ ^/j
ftians to embrace their Communion. In £ Vi
this State of Favor they remained under
the laft Kings of Pcrfia y and the fame was
fecured to them, as has already been faid, Sozom.lz:
by the firft Kalifs. As they well knew, c - 8 -
and as was the Belief of all Chriftians, Ce**».T.
there could be no fuch Thing as being of " P ' 4I * %
the Church without an Apoltolical Suc-
ceffion, that is, if the principal See had
not been founded by fome of the Apoftles
or Difciples of Jejus- Chriftj a Prerogative
they wanted, they fought for one w r hich
they thought fufficient. They began then
with the holy Bifhops of Seleiicia, whom
they would have to be the PredecefTors of
their Catholics^ but fraught with no other
Proof than that of pofTefTing the fame
Churches, wherewith they had been in-
vefted by infidel Princes. Then as, ac-
cording to the Tradition of the Mefcpta-
mian Churches, St. Thadteus preached the
Gofpel at Edeffdy a See they had alfo u-
furped, as well as the ancient School of
the Holy Scripture, w r hence they were
driven by Reraclius, but which they
were reftored to by the Arabs; by the help
of this and many Figments at the begin-
ning of -their Hiftory, they perfuaded their

fix firft Metropolitan Cities, accounted
fuch by the Neftorians only, were either
in Mefopotamia y or the Irak Ajami or the
perftan Irak, it being in thefe Provinces
that they firft began to fpread. After this
they erected a Metropolitan of Perfia that
is of the Country comprehended under the

conclude, the twelfth was that of China,
the thirteenth that of the Indies.

According to what we have noted above, V%eyweve

thence it follows that China being, in the mm 1 %

be faid thefe two were but one, and it may
feem that Trigaut fupplies us with a Proof
thereof; for fpeaking of the two laft Bi-

It is true, that in the latter Ages thefe two
Titles were put together, but formerly
they were diftinft; and in the Hiftory of

one Perfon. So the Catholic Shebarjapuah

There are many Examples of the fame
kind that occur among the A' r eft or 'ians^ and
the Abufe fprang from thefe Sources ;
for, Firfly notwithstanding the ancient
Canons, they admit in Concurrence with
other Chriftians, no Seel: has more da-*
ringly infringed them, and efpecially
in the Tranflation of Bilhops. Mori: of
their Catholics and Patriarchs were Bilhops
or Metropolitans of other Churches,
which not only was no Obftacle in the
Way of their Election, but they were al-
fo confec rated a new, much in the fame
Form with Bilhops. The Coptic Church of
A'esandria never gave way to this Abufe,
and down to thele latter Times me has
obferved it as a Rule , never to eleel: any
Man her Patriarch, if by Confecration he
was wedded to any particular Church.
The Jacobite Church of Antioch adhered a
long Time to the fame, and two of
her Metropolitans chofe rather to lay
down their Lives, than confent to the
Hmac, Election of Ifaac Bifhop of Harran into the
P: 9 8 - ' Patriarchal See of Antioch. The Greeks
have a long while forgot this holy Infti-
tution, nor can we ourlelves decently re-:
proach them therewith. It may then have
. hapned, that the Neft avian Patriarchs, pre-
fuming upon the full Power they arrogated,
thougnt they had Authority to make thefe
Unions ^ but to deal ingenuouily bythem 3
they may have had this ; Secondly ', To ex-

tury of Mohammedifm, by means of the
Privileges the Mekbites and Jacobins ob-

that in many Cities where the Neftorians
had been the only Chriftians, they were
not a number fufrlcient to conrtitute an E-
pifcopal Church or a Metropolitan. Hence
iome came to be joined with their Neigh-
bours, others were totally extinguifhed, as
in procefs of Time hapned to that of

firft arrived there. Then it became a
mere Title like thofe in Partibits Infidelium.

The Greek Patriarchs of Antioch have tfhe Pa-
pretended that their Jurifdi&ion reached trian ^ of
all over the Eaft, whence it is faid in the f™™ h

There is Reafon then to believe, that tfbefe frfi

and that they travelled thither by Land,
For that enigmatical Exprefiion, contemn
flando veniGrum regulam, & a nubibns c<eru-
kis direcfus, is far from proving, that this
Oloptien failed thither by Sea, and by the
help of the Cpmpafs. We want fomething
more than Chinefe Hiftory to perfuade
us they knew any thing of the Magnetic
Needle, but if we grant the Chinefe to
have ufed it, we are pretty fure the Syrians
did not; the Courfe they ihaped for the In-
dies is a plain Demonftration of their Igno-
rance in this Particular, But, indeed as they
had vaft Defarts to crofs before they could
reach China, they might have hadrecourfe
to the Needle to guide them, juft as they
do in the vaft Wildernefles of America,
when they were out upon any Difcovery.
Others, as thofe mentioned in the Se-
quel of the Chinefe Infcription, may have
gone thither by Sea, fleering the fame
Courfe laid down by our Authors } and
it is likely they went much about the
fame Time, the Metropolis of the Indies,
being immediately named after that of
China,
How long We may conclude, then, from what we
Chr utd' are ^^ ky the Infcription, that Chriftia-
China 1P n ^y wrrich was fir ft preached in China in
the Year DCXXXVI, fubfifted there till
the Date in Syriac, that is, till the Year of

China, and particularly of the Peftru&iori
ofCanfu in the Year of the Hejra CCLXI V",
or ofjefns Chrift DCCCLXXVII, relates
that a great Number of Chriftians was
there flaughtered. He fays nothing of
thole in other Cities, whence it feems
that in this City, which was the principal
Scale, there were none but Merchants.

But we are told by another Author,
whom we know but by the means of Golius y
in the Margin of one part of his Notes
upon AJfraganus, that the Chatholics fent
fome Ecclefiaftics into China, above an
hundred Years afterwards. This is the
Tranflation. " Abulfergius relates, from the
" Teftimony of a Monk of Najaran, thefe
u very Words, That he teturned from Cbi~
" na in the Year CCCLXXXVII, that is in
« the YearofC%?DCCCCLXXXXVII
iC whither he had been fent, feven Years
" before, or thereabouts, by the Catholics,
a together with five Peribns more • and
" that the Name of the City, he had been
i6 at, was Tajuna.

Hence we infer, that towards the end of w e know
the tenth Century, the Catholics or Nefto- nothing
rian Patriarchs continued to fend Million- f u / th Z! °f
aries to China, after the Example of their t p m £ lf~
Predeceffbrs. But from that time we are this Coun-
on all fides left in the dark concerning try fince
thefe Millions, whence it mould feem that the tmfh
Chriftianity was foon after wholly loft in Gcntm >

known. We do not difcern that there was
#ny Perfecution, like the laft in Ja$an y



122 ORIGINo/^

one of the moft cruel the Church ever
underwent ; nor could the Revolutions,
brought upon China by the tartar Con-
queftsof Jenghiz Khan and his Succeffbrs,
have been fatal to the Chriftians } for we
know that Jenghiz Khan himfelf had a love
for them ; his principal Wife was the
Daughter of Ung Khan whom he defpoiled
of Empire, and who was a Chriftian, as
were many of the Hoards of tartars that
paid him Homage. His SuccerTors were
to the full as well inclined towards the
'Cfcriitians ; and in the Life of Jahahalaha y
which ends the Hiftory of the Neftorians,
we read very remarkable Inftances to
prove it. It is therein related that this
Catholic was originally of Cathay, and that
he was fent by Abajha-Khan, great Em-
peror of the Tartars, to vifit the holy
Places at Jerufakm, there to lay certain
coftly Robes upon the Sepulchre, and af-
terwards dip them in the Jordan : That
aiterwards he was made Metropolitan of
Tang at , by his PredecerTor Danha, who
had invefted hirn with a plenary Authori-
ty over the Hoards of Chriftian Tartars,
and that at lait he was chofen Catholic.
He fat thirty feven Years ; but when the
Tartars were driven from Bagdad, the
Mohammedans deftroyed a part of the Ne~
ftcrian Churches, added to the former Tri-
'butes, and things put on quite another
Face.

From that time Hiflory fays nothing of
the fubje6\ we have been upon., and we

are left barely to guefs at what may further
concern it. This laft Revolution fell out
a little before this Catholic dyed, who de-
parted this Life in the MDCXXIX Year
of the Seleacidx, or the Year MCCCXVII
of Jefus Chrift. We find np Name that fuc^
ceeded him, and very probable it is, that
Chiftianity dwindled away by Degrees
in China for want of Paftors, or for fome
other reafons we know not. For when Barros.T.
the Portuguefe failed to China in the Year 3. l r 2. a
MDXVII under the command of Fernand 6 - h$-
Perez d'Andrade y who was the firft that
went to Canton^ there was not the leaft
Footftep of Chriftianity to be traced out ;
and the firft Miffionaries of that Nation as
well as the Caftilians, who crofled over
from the Philippine Ifland, met with none
that were not Idolaters. Some Crolfes
and other Signs, which have been fince
difccvered, being naked of all Date or
Infcription, could afford us no certain
Light, till the Year MDCXXY, when
the Monument we have had under conr
^deration was difcpvered.

INQUIRY

Into the Time when the Mohammedans
firft entered into

C H IN A.

OF the many curious Particulars to be
found in the Two Accounts we have
prefented to the Public, the En-
trance of the Mohammedans into China, be-
fore the third Century of the Hejra, is not
the leaft considerable. All their Hith>
rians are very obfeure upon their Travels
or Voyages to this part of the Upper Afta ;
and their moffc famous Geographers dif-
fer fo widely .from each other, that we
may believe they were as ignorant of
thofe Parts, as we were in 'Europe before
the Nautical Attempts of the two laft Ages.
Abulfeda y the moil accurate of their Geo-
graphers, {peaks of China merely by what
fie heard from feme Merchants. The reft
are full of Fables, fuch as Alexanders Tra-
vels to China, his Conference with the Em~
peror there, and the like : Their Copifts.
have but added to the ufelefs Lumber by

ftefii Stories, which have thickened the Mi ft,
and may convince us of their thorough Ig-<
norance : And, indeed, our Authors feem
to be the firft, and almoft the only Wri-
ters that have dwelt on thofe Parts with
fome tolerable exa&nefs. They firft told
us the Mohammedans had a considerable
Settlement in the principal Port of China^
and that they had there a Kadi, who a&ed
both as a Judge, and a Spiritual Director.
In a word, that great Numbers of Mobam~ .
rnedans were in the Imperial City before
the great Revolution, mentioned in the
fecond Account.

Our own Ancient Authors take Notice,
that in the vaft Provinces, known former-
ly by the Name of Cathay y they met with
Mohammedans, who had been there a long
while ; and the Accounts of the firft Je~
f uits that went to China, confirm what they
fay. They, in every City, found M<*
bammedans, in Number fufficient to evince
That they muft have been of very old ftand-
ing in the Country. But fince nor the
Ancients nor the Moderns give us any
Circumftances, or inform us when or how
they came into this Country, it may not
be unacceptable if we make fome Inquiry
into this Matter.

It is the Belief of many that the Mo* Wh&hs?
harmnedans went firft to China by Land, *'>Mo-
and that the Track purfued by fome mo- ^ ammc ~

-, ,_, „ \ , J dans went

dern Travellers, ought to point out to us thither by.
the Road the Ancients may have taken-: Land,
Marco Pok^ fay they, went into China by

the

the way of T'artary ; Mandemlle almoft trod
in his very Footfteps; j^£^3 Khan, the firft
Emperor of the Moguls, conquered a Part
of China, and marched thereto from the
ancient Moguliftan or Turkeftan; we have
a Perjian Account of an Embafly from a
^Tartar Prince to the Emperor of China, and
this Ambafiador went alfo by Land; at
Voyages tne beginning of this Century, Benet Goez i
dcTheve- a Jefuit, travelled alfo from the Indies to
not. T. 4. Pckin ; the Fathers Grueber and Orville
did a few Years ago perform the fame
Journey the Mofcovitc Ambafladors do
when they go to China, and they evert
allure us, this Rout, which is not always
the fame, is pretty well frequented by the*
Caravans of the Merchants of the Upper
Afta> Thefe different Routs are pricked
down in the Map of Cathay, published by
Kircher in his China lllujirata ; and Father
Couplet had another, which pretty much
confounded us, tho' the Names of the Places
were written in Perjian.

All thefe Inftances fufficiently prove that
we may go to China by Land, and there
is no doubt of it; but the Way held by
a fmall Number of Travellers does not
feem to prove, That for certain the fame
was held by the Caravans and Merchants^
which ought to have been the Cafe, for
fuch a Number of Mohammedans to get in-
to China that way. For, according to the
old Method of travelling in Caravans, it
was a very hard matter for the Merchants
of Perfta and Mesopotamia to go. thither by

Land, unlefs the Track was well frequent-
ed- and it feems not only certain that it
was far from being fo, but alfo that it was
coniideredonlyas a By-way, a Short Cut.

The better to clear up this Difficulty, <f cUarup
which, well explained, may let us into this matter
many Points of Eaftern Hiifcory and Geo- we mu fi
graphy, we mull firft furyey the Extent of ™%% n w „
the Mohammedan Empire in the third Cen- ih e Limits
tury of the Hcjra, and at the fame time cj the M.o-
confider w r hat Bounds the Eaftern Geogra- fcammed-
phers fet to the Provinces of the Upper ™Jj~^j
Afia, nearer! the Borders of China. Ceritwf?

Mohammed made himfelf Matter of a
part of Arabia } and Abubecr his Succeflbr
conquered the reft of this Province, with
the greateft part of Syria : Egypt alfo was
fubdued in his Reign, and thefe Conquefb
were enlued by others Weft ward, which
are foreign to our Subject. In Afia, the
Mohammedans had two potent Enemies to
cope with, the Romans and the Perfiatis *
the former were Lords of the greateft part
of Syria on this fide the Euphrates ; the latter
were Supreme over the reft, and their Em-
pire extended far away into the Upper Afta.
The Romans were driven out of Syria in
the Reign of Heraclius, by Omar the third
Kalif, who pofTefTed himfelf of Damafius,
and all the Holy Land. The Empire of
the Sajfanian or Cofroid Perftans expired at
almoft the fame time, by the Defeat of Ifde-
jerdy the Son of Shah-Riar, the lait of thefe
Princes,who being forced out of all the Per"
fan Iraky retreated into ChoraJJan^whQtQ he

of the greateft part of Choraffan ; and Ab-
. dallahj the Son of Amar, who commanded
the Troops on that iide, advanced quite up
co the Oxus or River of Balky before the
Death of Ifdejerd.

The civil War which broke out in the
Reign of AU y the fifth Kalif* and which
blazed till the Settlement of the Family
of the Omrniyads, put a flop to this mighty
Progrefs : But in the Year of the Hejra
LXXVI, and of Jefus Chrift DCXCV, they
made an irruption into Tabariftan or 2^-
breftan. In the. firft Century alfo they
made fome Conquefts in Armenia^ and
and in the Country of the Turks ; but
as the Arabs bellowed this Name pro-
mifcuoufly on feveral Provinces of the Up*.

Wdlid, the thirteenth Kalif, who be-
gan his Reign in the Year of the Hejra

much enlarge the Extent of the Mohamme-*
dan Empire. Kdtiba y one ojl his Generals,

ents, together with Farganah, and many

the Mohammedans marched not, till a long
time afterwards. It is true, the Oriental.
Hiftories tell us, that in the Days of
Malec-jhah the third of the Seljukids, their
Empire reached to Cajhgar^ but this King-
dom was not fubdued under the Kaliis,
but by Kings, who not only difowned Elihac.

We murt conclude then, that in the When out
third Century of Mohammedifm, when our Authors
Authors lived, the Mohammedans might go fJ ot l' th *
to the uttermoft Parts of the Mawaral- mC( ^^
nabffij without exceeding the Bounds of Empire ex*

ing the ten Degree neceffary to make

Rate the Way the Arabs muffc have held for
China, was by going firrl into Chorajfan y
from thence into the Mawaralnahra ; to have
gone itrait from Samar candy or fome other
City of the Province, deftroyed by the
Moguhy into Tibet y or to have gone into
the Kingdom of Cajhgar y there to join the
Caravans. They fometimes alfo went by
the way of Gaznaby upon the Skirts of
Chorajfariy which had great Dealings; or
by Cabal a City to the Eaftward of Gaznab,
and which, in Abttlfedds Time, was the laft
City inhabited by Mohammedansy on the
Borders of Tokarefian y or Tarkeftatiy and
the Place where the Indous and Mo/km

vellers had got into Tibet , they might have
entered China y by the Province of Chenfi y

But it was ftill more eafy to reach China

tends to the Sandy Defart, as Father Mar-
tini has it in his Chart. Not but that the

places it but four Days diftant from the
Capital of that Kingdom, whereas the
Eaftern Geographers clap ten Degrees be-

any Thing from what they fay • for they
knew but little of the Provinces beyond
the Mawaralnahra, and the Countries of
Cajhgar and Cotan 5 for under the general
Name of Turan, or Turkejian, Tajuje and

prehended all the Provinces Northward

WisJVay But this Way by Land, whether by
was im- Samarcand, by Cabal, by Gaznah, or by
paatcabie. Ca p gaTj was very i mpra aicable in the
Days our Arabs wrote, excluilve of the
natural Inconveniencies of the Roads they
were to travel. All the Trade of the
Eaft was then in the Hands of the Mer-
chants of Perfia, Bajfora, and of the
Coart. quite down to the Red-Sed y which
was the Center of the Egyptian Trade, and
partly of the Mediterranean. They traded
to the Indies by Land, in many Places,
and particularly at Cabuh The Product
of Arabia, Egypt ', Perjta, and the adjacent
Provinces they exchanged with the Mer-
chants of Tarkeftan and the Indies, for
Musk, precious Stones, Chryftals, Spices,
and Drugs : But it was almoft impoflible
for them to go farther, or to drive a
Trade quite home to China, becaufe of the
Defart, a dangerous Track; and flill
more, becaufe of the continual Wars be-
tween the Arabs and the Princes of tturkefi
tan. And the civil Broils which during
the firft Centuries, and afterwards were
fomented between the diftkrentMohammedan
Princes of Chorajfan, and the Tyranny of

Trading extenfively by Land.

Nor does it appear that any of thefe
Obitacles were removed for a confides
able time ; for the Mohammedans did not
penetrate into thofe Provinces of Turke-
ftan^ conterminous with the Mawaralnahra
and Cboraffan, 'till three hundred Years
after the firft Voyages by Sea we are here
to fpeak of.

The various and numerous Nations, TVTurks
the Arabs comprehended under the gener- came late
al Name of Turks^ came very late into ™ t0 M °~
Mohammedifin^nd. the Moguls ,~ when be- ^ mQ ~

to Cond Emir j and even the whole Pro-

The Arabs then could not fafely venture
a-crofs thefe Provinces, inhabited as they
were, either by Enemies or by People
of different Perfualions, who had moil of
them been driven out of ChoraJJan and the
Mawaralnahra by the prevailing Arms of the
Kalifs. The Baits of a gainful Com-
merce could fcarce bewitch the Arabs to
run fuch Rifques, and efpecially as the

Bulk of Trade was negociated, as it a£?
terwards was, upon the Sea of India ;and
indeed by the Accounts of Goods we read
in Arabian Authors, we furHciantly under-
ftand they had no large Dealings with
thofe remote Provinces ', that the Drugs
they had from thence were brought to
the Mohammedan Cities, by the Turkijb
or Indian Traders ; and that all their
Furs, in which may have confuted the
moil advantageous Branch of their Trafc
fie, they had from Armenia and Belad ah
Jebel, or from the Barbarian Coait, whence
they had the Tygers and Leopards Skins,
they fo much valued for Caparifons and
Saddles.

They would formerly from Spain and Afric
go firft to Mecca, then to Bagdad, thence
to Balk, to Samarcand and to Nifapor to

ademies. Ebn Shalikan, in his Lives of
Illuitrious Men, has many Examples of
fuch Traverfes, which in thofe Days were

The Molhhs and the Learned in particular
paid them great refpect ; many Princes
had bequeathed Foundations for their Sup-

the Koran, and a parcel of traditionary
Stories about Mohammed, they had fome
fmattering of the Law, and a bent for Htpry of
the Arabefque Poetry, they were fure of the p ™~
a kind Reception throughout the extent J^ ft r ^
of the Mohammedan Empire, jurt as our damus.

All this might induce us to conclude, f^ s r c f r ~ e
that the firft Arabs that went to China, knewlny
were Merchants. The way thither by but the
Land was Co little ufed during the three Maritime
firft Centuries of Mohammedifm, and even ®**" °$
for fome Time afterwards, that Hiftory
fcarce Records one Example of any At-
tempt of the kind. Now it cannot be very
eafy to fuppofe, that this Road was bea-
ten by the Caravans, and the Geogra-

but had it been a common Road, Tra-

of it ; and yet we have not one Eaftern

Stand they are at when they offer to fix

anciently the Opinion that all this vart Ex-
tent w r as inhabited by none but Hoards or
Tribes of Nomad Tartars, Wanderers, and
deftitute of Towns; but in the Hiftory
of Jenghiz Khan you have Accounts of
Sieges which lailed many Months, and
fucii Slaughters of the Inhabitants of the
conquered Places as abundantly evince
them to have been very numerouily po-
pulous. Jenghiz Khan was a Defcendant
of Buzanjir Khan, who had been a potent

To all this we may add the little Moham-

in the Taza or ancient Cuftoms of the

tars afterwards upon the Choice of Reli-
gion, that feveral of the Defcendants of
Jenghiz Khan became Chriftians, while
fome of them embraced Mohammedifm, and
others adhered to the old Keligion of the
Country. From this Piece of Hiftory
we may, almost, by a natural Induction
conclude, That the Mohammedans had hi-
therto but a very {lender Commerce with
thefe People of the Upper Afta 5 for they
have ever made a Number of Converts in
the Places were they have fettled, or where
they have had Liberty of Trade. Hence
is it that great Numbers of them have been
found upon all the Coafts of India, for a
few Families of them fettling in fome of
the chief Cities of the Coalt, were fuffir
cient to give Rife to fome fmall Colonies,
which, in Procefs of Time, became very
potent. Thus was it, that under the great
Empire of the Seljukids, when the Moham-
tmdqns had Intercourfe with the Kingdoms

of

of Cashgar and Cotan, that Mohammedifm
was by little and little introduced ; which
they ealily compaffed, fupported as they
were, by the Power of ChoraJJan y the Ma-
waralnahra, and the neighbouring States,
in Subjection to the Soltans, who, fome of
them, as Make Shah y Mahmudj his Son,
and fome others of the fame Family refid-
ed in thofe very Parts.
Jtfrade It is certain, that after the Divifion of

<f Jenghiz was opened with a View to trade princi-
&han, pally, and that fome now travelled to
thofe Parts out of Curiofity. The Mer-
chants of ChoraJJan, who traded upon the
Frontiers, did fometimes venture to crofs
the Defart in Caravans } but fome of thefe
Attempts mifcarrying, the Usbek Princes,
and fome of the Myrza Tartar s, moftly de-
fended of Jenghiz Khan, by Ttili Khan,
his elder! Son, began to fend Ambafladors
to China y by them to protect the Trade,
which turned chiefly to the Advantage of
thefe Princes. Shah Rok y the Son of Ta-
merlany did in like Manner fend an Em-
bafly to China y which was joined by the
Ambafladors of feveral other Princes and
many Merchants. The Account of this
Embaffy is in Perfian, and the Tranilation

ther Martini acquaints us that thefe Em-
baffies come to China every three Years, or

that -Other wife the Cbinefe would not ad-
mit the Merchants into their Empire. The
Caravans ufually attend upon thefe Ambaf-
fadors, who, as Trigaut tells us, come al- L
fo from fome other Neighbouring King-* p.' 54^
doms, with Prefents to the Emperor of
China, by way of Tribute. Thus is it they
iniinuate themfelves into a Trade, and the
Prefents they receive are often more con-
fiderable than what they bring ; for the
Chinefi Minifters of State make a grand
Affair of thefe pretended EmbafTies, as if
they derived a very great Veneration upon
their Emperor, and perfe&ly anfwered
the Flight of his Ambition. But though
we were allured that for four Hundred
Years pall the Mohammedans have made it
a Pra£tice to trade with China by Land,
it would not follow that they did or could
do the fame during the three fir ft Centu-
ries of the Empire, or that they reforted
thither in fuch Companies as may be fup-
pofed to have fettled in any Number in the
principal Cities the Land way.

All that has hitherto been offered, and It 1 mop
much more that might be added, feems HMythat
evidently to prove that the Mohammedans ihe ^™ h *

When the Mohammedans

for many Ages pail they have known haW
to take an Observation, to divide Sea
Charts, and perform the feveral Parts of
our mod able Navigators. Granting all
this, it muit of Courfe follow that they
made nothing of the great Indian Ocean,
and that they traverfed it, backwards and
forwards, as we do at prefent* Thus is it
that a modern Author concludes, forming
his Judgment from a Supposition that the
Saracens had the Ufe of the Aftrolabe long
before the Portuguefe, " The Saracens j fays
he, " had ufed it a long Time before
" upon the great Indian Ocean, to take the
a Altitude of the Sun and other Stars",

And in another Treatife he fays to the
fame Purpofe :

" It is alfo of them we learned the
a Ufe of the Affcrolabe, for which they
" have fo many Names in their Tongue,
" and for the feveral Parts of this fo
a univerfal and ufeful Inftrument in Aftro-
a nomy ; which they fo well applyed on

a and other Stars, in the midft of their
" great Conquetts, Navigations, and Dif-
" coveries, as we have elfewhere obferv-
li ed. And indeed how could their Em-
" pire, their Religion, and their Tongue,
" fo long have prevailed, and fo exten-
" lively, among the remoter! Iflands, and
a the fartheft Eaftern Shores, without the

"Seas"? This Writer, tho' a very
judicious Man, and many others, fince
him, at once fuppofe the Thing to have
been as they wouid have it, and demon-
Urate a very uncertain Matter, by another
abundantly more fo. For if the Mohamme-
dans have peopled a Part of the Coafts of
the Eaft Indie* and Afric y it need not fol-
low that they went thither by Sea, and
tho' they did for certain reach fome Parts
by Sea, it is not certain that they failed by
Obfervation, or that they were skilled in
all the Parts of Navigation required for
the Condu£t of a Ship in a long run.

But to the Point ; we do not find the We find

may we fay it is impoffible that fo ufeful
and fo marvellous a Difcovery fhould be
concealed in fome rare and uncommon
Books, if for fo many Ages it was in the
Hands of their Sea ArtirTs.

Now there is not one original Word
either in Arabic, ( Turkijh y or Per/tan, which
can properly fignify either the Ailrolabe
or the Compafs. The Arabs and the Turks
commonly call the Compafs Hojfola, the
Italian Name, which ihews that the Thing
lignified is foreign to them as well as the
Word. Kotubnema is a Compound ,
and a Word of modern Ufe with the Per-
Jans. Their Naturalifts, who have Co

amply



J44 JVbtn the Mohammedans

amply expatiated upon the Virtues of the'
Load-ftone, and repeated all they found
concerning it in the ancient Greek Au-
thors, have never once hinted at the Pro-
perty of the Magnatic Needle; nor da
we meet with one iingle Obfervation, made,
of ancient Date, by the Arabs, on the
Variation of the Needle, or any Induc-
tion confequent thereto for the Affiitance
of Navigators.

The Arabian, the Furkijb, and the Per~
Jian Pilots, prefer the Compafies made in
Europe to thofe they make themfelves, aud
are not yet perfect in the Method of touch-
ing their Needles. Indeed fince they have
been taught by our Seamen, they know
the Ufe of the Compafs very well, and ven-
ture upon long Runs in the Indian Ocean,,
by the Help thereof and fucceed very
well : But by this we underftand, That
if in lefs than two Centuries they have
learned enough of the Franks to become
intelligent Navigators, they could not
have had the fame Knowledge feveral
Ages before, and at the fame Time be
ignorant of all the Principles of Naviga-
tion, as they were at the Time of the
firft Difcoveries. The moft ancient Ma-
thematical lnrtruments they have for Nau-
tical Ufes, can never be ftrong enough
to combat this Conjecture. Some in-
deed they have which are well enough
wrought, and particularly fmall Aftro-
labes, which their moft skilful Pilots carry
in their Bofom } and it is certain, that

they

they have a long time made ufe oi this
Initrument, whence Bergeron gathers That
they failed by Obfervation, and even
ufed the Compafs : But no one is fo
ignorant as not to know the wide dif-
ference there is between thefe two In-
ftruments ; or that tho', by the help of
an Aftrolabe, an Obfervation of the Stars
may be taken, it is of no ufe to the
Seaman in fleering his Courfe without
the help of the Compafs.

It is in vain to fuppofe the Arabs had WUfbw
the Gompafs before us, becaufe they have *% ha *
had intercourfe with the Chinefe eight f^ C f^

It feems moft likely then that the A-
rahsj in the firffc Ages of Mohammedifm^
had no knowledge of the Compafs, and
that they never failed by Obfervation
till they imbibed the Precepts of that
Art from the Europeans : And certain
it is, by the Teftimony of our two Au-
thors, and by that of all the Eaftern Ge-
ographers, who often take notice of
Courfes and Diftances, That they were
formerly mere Coafters, or that when
they did venture to leave the Land, it
was for no great Run, and this is what
made their Voyages fo long and dan-
gerous. They failed from the Perjicm
Gulf, and thence ranged along Shore
quite down to the Point of Malabar ', and
having doubled it, whether they flood
over for the Ifles of Andaman^ or made
for fome other Port in the Gulf of Ben-
gal y they did not ftir far from Land,
and particularly as they came in with
the Coaft of China.

They were very follicitous about I-
flandsand Anchoring-grounds, which our
People now avoid as much as pofible,
that their Voyage may not be retarded,
and themfelves expofed to fuch dangers
as they are in no fear of at Sea, The
jBuik of the Siraf Shipping, as described

by our Author, may fatisfy us they were
not calculated for the high Sea; for their
Planks fewn, as we may fay, together
with Coco-nut Yarn, and almoit defti-
tute of Iron, could never have held in the
tumbling Weather our Ships frequently
meet with in thofe Seas.

We mull not wonder then if the Dis-
coveries the Arabs made by Sea, in fix
or feven hundred Years time, are not
comparable to thofe of the Portuguefe^ Ca-
ft'il'ians, Italians^ and, in a Word of all
the European Nations, whom the Ori-
entals commonly furpafs in Induftry • for
the want of the Compafs is ever an Ob-
ftacle in the way of long Runs*

From what has been faid we may fate- Tie Arabs
ly conclude That the Arabs did not ven- '^cucmau
ture far out to Sea 5 that they failed by ^J^ mt
an inaccurate reckoning and the Obfer- at $ ta
vation of the Stars • that the little Know-
ledge they had of the Winds and Mon-
foons, made them often miftake in their.
Run and the Dirtance of Maritim Pla-
ces, as fufficiently appears by their gene-
ral Meafure of a Day's Sail by Sea, which
is fo vague and uncertain that there
is no reducing it to any fixed Stand-
ard : And that thus they only coafted it
along, or at leaft that they feldom left
the Shore out of Sight behind them ;
and that, confequently, they are not to
be fuppofed the Original Difcoverers of
the true Courfe to be fleered for the
Great Indus and China..

Now if we examin into the Caufes of
this Imperfe&ion in their Science of Na-
vigation, there are two which principal-
ly occur to us. Firftj The Arabs being
no great Inventors, as appears by the
little Progrefs they made in Learnings
beyond what they had from the Greek
Books tranflated into their Tongue, found
no Inftruftion in thofe fame Books to
make then Navigators. For the Greeks y
tho' they had potent Fleets, knew no-
thing ol launching out into the Sea, and
many of the Learned think they hardly
ever ventured upon the Ocean, but connnea
themfelves to the Mediterranean. The
Carthaginians alfo were no more than
Coafters, and tho* it were certain Han-
no ran down to the Cape of Good-Hope,

Conftru&ion of the ancient Ships was not
adapted to the Ocean ; for they all went
with Oars which are not only ufelefs but
dangerous in Voyages of Length. The
Defcription of the great Coaft of the In-
dies, or of the Eryth<ean Sea, as Arrian
has left it us ; and what we read in
Pliny concerning the Courfe fleered by
the Ships, that traded to the Indies from
the Red-Sea, can only confirm us in our
Opinion. For if we except the Voyage

to

to Taprobana or Ceylon, with the Wind
called HippalttSy that is, by obferving
the Monfooi), it does not appear they
knew how to keep a Reckoning. The
Arabs therefore could pick nothing out
of the Greek Books to inform them of
this neceftary Art, and their very little
acquaintance with the Latin would not
allow them to under ftand what Pliny and
thofe he quotes had written. For the
Book they have under the Name of Pli-
ny, is fo very unlike the Original, that
we can fcarce believe it was ever in the
Hands of the Perfon who pretended to
give it in Arabic. The Arabs then only
continued to go from the Red-Sea to
Malabar and Ceylon, but in time ventur-
ing farther than the Romans had been,
they, from Ifle to Me, at length difco-
ver'ed the Shores of China,

In the fecond Place, nor the KaJifs
nor the Soltans who fucceeded them,

Sea Strength had been of but infig-
nificant Uie in the other principal Af-
fairs, and Revolutions of this great Em-
pire.

To all this it may be added, That the ge-
neral abundance of Things neceflary for
Life, or to fupply Luxury in the Moham-
medan Provinces was fuch, that they had
no Occafion to expofe themfelves to the
Dangers of a long Voyage to go in

came. For the Indians brought by Land,
to Cabul and fome other Places, and
by Sea to Bajfora and Sir of, all the Com-
modities of the Indies and China. Furs
were brought into Syria by the Provin-
ces of Adarbejatij by Cur di ft an and other
Parts more Northerly. Great quantities
of the fame they alio had from the Bar-
barian Coaft, by the way of the ~ Red-
Sea^ from whence a great Trade was
carried on with them all over Egypt*

Mines of Sofala y brought to them by the
Negroes who traded with Egypt by the
way of the Defart, or from Port to Port

the Indies they, by their Trade with the
Chinefe and Indian Merchants, had Silk,

rich Stuffs, and many other Manufa-
ctures ; Drugs and Spices. With this Stock
of Goods they drove a very consi-
derable Commerce, by the way of Ka-
hira \_Cairo^\ with the Venetians, the Ge-
noefe, the Catalans, and the Greeks ; and
therefore they were under no neceffity
of going fo far as China. Wherefore it
is very probable That the firft Adventu-
rers that undertook this Voyage were
urged thereto by the Calamities of the
Civil Wars, which, having reduced many
Families to Want,obliged them to feek fome
Livelihood by Trade, deprived as they
were of all other means of Subliftance. AnS
accordingly one of our Authors obferves

their Ships fpeaks them to have been
more Skilful in nautical Architecture
than any of the other Orientals. We
have given you the Testimony of Fath.
Martini as to the very ancient Know-
ledge they boaft to have had of the
Magnetic Needle ; and our Authors af-
fure us, That in their time the Chinefe
came to the Pcrfian Gulf. So they had
failed along throughout the Mlands ; and
even had Settlements upon fome of them,
remains of which are at this Day upon
Malacca and in other Parts. We read
alfo in fome Authors, That they conquered
CochinchifM) and the Neighbouring States
quite to Pegu ; and others allure us That
thofe States formerly paid Tribute to
China. Now tho' the bell Authors ac-
quaint us that they marched their Ar-
mies by Land, it is neverthelefs certain
that, long before the Difcoveries of the
laft Ages, they had Fleets which made
them Mailers of all thofe Seas, and it is
thought they once fubdued the Empire
of Japan by means of their Shipping.
But as it is above twelve hundred Years
ago fince this People, not very Warlike
by Nature, have given over all thoughts
of enlarging their Empire, they, as con-
fiderable Navigators as they were, made
no Conquefts among the lilands upon
the Coafts of the Eafterri Ocean, and have
been very unwilling to admit Strangers
among them under the pretence of Trade,

It is commonly reported that this Pro-
hibition is almoft as old as the Empire ,
and yet by the great number of Moham-
medans, Jews, Indians, and even Syria**
Chriftians that fettled among them, it
appears that this fame Prohibition was
not very ftri&ly minded, as may be clear-
ly gathered by all the Circumftances in
our two Authors.

NavaretU thinks they failed no farther
than the Straits oiSincapor, or Sunda, becaufe
their Ships are not flrong enough to
live in the heavy Seas of the great In-
dian Ocean ; and will have it that there
is not the leaft room to imagin they e-
ver reached Ceylon, and much lefs Su
Lawrence or Madagascar, as feveral of
the Portttguefe Navigators at firft gave out.
He adds, that they had never underta-
ken fuch long Voyages to conquer far
diftant Countries, feeing they never were
inclined to fpread the Fame of their
Arms ; that the Trade of Metals, Silks
and the principal Drugs, could not have
been their Motive for fuch Undertakings,
feeing they were in China itfelf abund-
antly fupplyed with all triefe Things; and
that in ihort it does not appear they
had any Inftruments proper to take Ob-
fervations, or that they ever knew how
to divide, or proje& Sea Charts.

But our firft Author partly deflroys the
Conje&ures of Navareiie by alluring us
That in his Time the Cbinefe Ships came to
jSirafy tho' they dared not go farther, be-
caufe

caufe of the bad Weather, and great Seas
they could not endure, and that thus they
did not offer to go quite up to Baffbra y OT
into the Red-Sea. As for the Poriugueje'
Writers who would have it they failed as
far as the Cape of Good Hope, they built
their Ailertion upon the uncertain Founda-
tion of fome Manners and Cuftoms, among
the Cafres and People of the- Ea& Coaft
of Afric^ which, as they thought, had fome
Refemblance of what they had obferved
among the Chinefe* This is a Matter of
great Obfcurity, and can never be cleared
up till we are more exactly informed of
the Chinefe Hiftory than we are.

It is very extraordinary alfo that the.
Arabs fhould have been eight Hundred
Years acquainted with all the Seas of In~
dia y and yet never leave .a Sea-Chart be-
hind them, to afcertain their Difcoveries,
and guide their Pofterity: And yet it
does not feem that they drew up any
Charts in the firffc Times, and we have
very great Reafon to fuppofe they are in-
debted for this Piece of Art to the Occi-

feniible of their Ignorance in this Particu-
lar, and no fooner did the Europeans print
their Maps than the Orientals put a great
Value upon them: They have even en-
deavoured to make them their own, by
writing the Names of the Places in their
own Characters and Tongue, by the com-
mon Names current with us.

In the Commentaries of Alfmfo a" Albu-
querque) we read of a Moorijh Pilot, at Cali-
cut) who had a very exact Draught of all
the Coafts of the Indies } and it is credi-
ble, that the Arabs) who, by Egypt and
Syria, had a continual Commerce with the
Europeans) had by the Venetians and Geno-
efe y in thofe Days the greateft. Navigators

their Voyages to India and China. But
thefe are very extraordinary Inftances ; for
they had fo little improved upon what they
borrowed from our Seamen,That ever flnce

thrown alide their own Charts to make ufe

the Protection of the Governor of Egypt ,
who fent a Guard with them through the
Defart. Their PafTage over into Spam was
fo mere a Trifle that it is not worth the
naming, and even for that, it feems, they
made ufe of Chriffcian Ships. TheConqueft of
Majorca, Minorca, and 2 r mca, was compaf-
fed a long time after, when the Arabs had
by their Slaves and Renegadoes been
taught what to do with a Ship : But all
thele maritim Enterprifes, conilfted of no
more than embarking a Parcel of Troops
on board of Flat-bottomed Vefiels, they
had fcarce any other, and landing with Dis-
cretion. Their Voyages to Sicily, Sardi-
nia, and Calabria were to the full as eafy.
Their Fleets did not then fweep the Seas,
there were then but few Corfairs, and when
the Chriftian Princes began to fit out any
considerable Strength, the Mohammedans
were unable to ftand againft them ; but
in a very fhort Time were driven from

fieged with the unfortunate Event related
at large in the Portuguefe Writings. But,
befides that this Expedition was fet on
foot above forty Years after the Difcovery
of the Indies, there was fo great a Number
of Chriftian Seamen and Officers on board
of this Fleet, that we may fairly afcribe
to them all the Honour of this Voyage.

The Arabian Colonies difepvered on the tfheirCob-

went to thofe Parts by Sea, and that they
made their Settlements much in the fame
Manner the Portuguefe conquered and Peo-
pled a vart Extent of Country from Cape
Eojador quite to China', but it is certain,
thefe Settlements were owing to a very dif-
ferent Origin. The Arabs were at Sofala
and Mofambique before the Difcovery of the
Cape of Good-Hope } and it was no very
difficult Matter for thofe who were mAfric
and in Egypt, to go down to the Eaft
Coaffc, which for many Ages had been
famed for Trade. Thus it was that they
peopled die Egyptian Side of the Red-Sea \
becaufe the Caravans of that great Pro*
vince came ufually down thither to trade
with the Perfian Merchants, who brought
them all Sorts of Commodities from the
the Indies and China, which they exchang-
ed with them for thofe of Egypt and

they been poileffed of great Fleets to make

they would have undertaken the Conquer!
of this Country, as they did by all thofe
they could get at with their Arms ^ but we
do not understand by their Hiftories, nor
even by the Portuguefe Accounts, that their
morl coniiderable Cities were owing to any
Thing belides Trade and Religion. It
was Trade that formed the Arabian Colo-
nies of Monbaza, jQiufoa, and Mozambique,
and fome other Places on the Way to the
Great Indies, where the firffc Families in-
creafed to that Degree, That, in Procefs of
Time, they made a good Part of the In-
habitants of the Places. Religion alfo
gave Birth to fome Settlements, when Ido-
latrous Princes were perfuaded to Moham-
wedifm by Fakirs, who, as we fhall ob-
ferve hereafter, often devoted themfelves
to fuch Mimons. Under thefe two Pre-
tences did the Mohammedans get footing in
feveral coniiderable Ports of the Indies :
But, tho' they were in great Favor with
the Princes, were very rich, and partook
largely in the Government, they were
never confidered as the predominant Part,
as they had not obtruded themfelves by

They were neither erected nor aided by

And fo little do we know of the interior

John de Barros y who met with fome of their:

The Arabians fubdued Egypt in the very
firft Century of their Hejra ; and fome
Years afterwards they made a Conqueft of

the Ports of the Red-Sea. There is fome
room then to believe that this {birring,
this indefatigable and avaricious People,
trading at firft upon the Coaft with the
Negroes, underftood they had their Gold
from the Mines of Sofala and Monqmatapa,
that Ivory abounded in the Country, and
that great Wealth might be thence accu-
mulated ^ this was furely the Rife of the
firft Arabian Colonies in thofe Parts, tho*
juft at what Time we cannot fay. It was
eafy for them to fettle upon this Coaft;
becaufe the Negroes who lived in the Up-
land had no Towns, but dwelt in Hutts

they built dered t0 t he uttermoft Parts of Egypt, of

^ ' had fettled towards the Eaft Coaft ; where
they lived, in their ancient Manner, under
Tents, feeding of Flocks, which were
their chief Support, while they cultivated
fome Trade with the Cafres ; but the Bar-
barity of thefe Cafres made them edge by
Degrees to the Coaft, and there build a
City whofe beginnings are to us unknown.
After this, thefe fame Arabs ftrengthned
by others, built Brava, and Monbaza, and
fome other Cities of the Coaft quite to
Gkiiloa.

many Republics or little Kingdoms, when

them were Sonnis or of the Arabian Se&,
others were Imamis, or of the Perjian ;

a Jealoufy of each other in Trade, ftirred
them to great Wars, which it feems the

the Arabs do, or Zinguebar as the Per/tans.
All the Shores Northward and then Eaft-
ward quite to the River Indus, were in
Subjection to the Mohammedans : And
from the Indus down to Cape Comorin,
they met with Moors in many Places, but
particularly at Calicut. Barros relates,
that Sarama Payrimal being feduced to
Mohammedifm, and being defirous to dye c * I# $*
at Mecca, divided Malabar, his Domini-
ons, between his Children and Relations,
and that he gave Calicut to one of his Ne-
phews who was his chief Heir, together
with the Title of Samorin, or Emperor of
Malabar.

The Moors coming to Coulam to trade, q> heh - r »
this King Payrimal gave them Calicut Settlements
where they kept their grand Warehoufes, there owing
not only of the Pepper and Ginger the t0 ^ de -
Country abundantly produces, but alfo of
all. the Drugs and Spices which were
brought from the Iflands, and the utter-
moft Parts of the Earl. This Settlement
and the Veneration the Samorins, who
f ucceeded Sarama Payrimal, had for the
Moors, gave them a great Sway at Calicut,

and upon all the Coaft, where they made
Allyances with the Principal Indians, who
thought it an Honour to give them their
Daughters in Marriage. They insinuated
themfelves alio into a great Intereft with
the Princes of the difierent Parts of the
Coaft, as Idalcan, Nizamaluco, Cotalmaluco,
Madramaluco, for being at perpetual War
with each other, they made great account
of the Moors , and endeavoured all they
could to engage them in their Service,
they being, in thofe Times, the beft Soldi-
ers in all the Indies. Molt of the Patans

By the fecond they got footing in Afric
down to Cape Currents, among the poor
unarmed Carres who had it not in their
Power to prevent them from feizing on
what Parts they faw good: Their Colo-
nies of Magadoxo, Brava, and Q^uiha were
fomewhat in the Nature of ours in thefe
latter Times ; but not fo difficult to main-
tain, becaufe of the Proximity of the
Red-Sea, whence the Arabs had all Sorts
of Afliftance. By the two other they
feated themfelves in all the other Parts,
but more efpecially by Commerce. Thefe
Voyages were not in thofe Days fo fafe
and fo frequent; wherefore the Merchants
were under a necellity of making a long
Stay at the principal Scales, where they
took to them Wives, their Religion al-
lowing them a number; thefe new Fami-
lies brought on others, and the Princes
being fenlible it was greatly for their Ad-
vantage to draw the Trade of Perjta, Ara-
bia, and at the fame time of Egypt, and
Europe, by the Red^Sea, into their own
Ports, thefe Merchants met every where
with the kindefh Ufage they could wiih.
Thefe Idolatrous Princes,confirmedin their
old Superftitions, were not at all fcrupu-
lous about differences in Religion, but ad-
mitted all indifferently. So they readily
allowed their Subjects to embrace Msham-
medifm, which they preferred to the reft ;
becaufe of the hopes thefe Arabs gave

whofe Power was known in the remoteft
Eaft : Even Princes themfelves made pro-
feffion of Mohammedifhi in troublefom
Times, that the Moors might join them ; for
in latter Days they were lo multiply ed,
■ that they alone peopled whole Cities, or
a part of the moft considerable. Thus
this Religion, which has nothing very in-
convenient in it, did by little and little ob-
tain in many Parts; and at length received
an accefs of Power, when fome of its Pro-
feffors being raifed to the firft Pofts in the.
Courts of Cambaya and Guzarat, invited
a greater number of thofe Aiiatic Turks
called Rumis, and even feized on fome
Pofts, as did Malic Az, who raifed a con-*
iiderable Settlement at Dm, from whence
he a long time infefted the Portuguefe.

ters over to Mohammedifm* From Malacca
they failed round to the Molucca's, and
having prevailed on the Kings of Tidore
and Tern ate, together with feveral others to
join with them in Religion, they reaped
great Benefits from thefe Princes, whom

obtain nothing farther there than the free
Exercife of their Religion* The great

ner of this was widely different from the
Way taken to proclaim the Gofpel to the
Univerfe, particularly by the Apoftl.es in
the firft Ages of the Church : The Difci-
ples of Chrifi were harmlefs, humble,
poor, patient, and foes to Riches } and
fo averfe were they to every fort of Vio-
lence, That many of the primitive Chri-
ftians, moved by the Spirit of Meeknefs
and Forbearance, forfook the Profeffion of
Arms, deeming it unlawful to fight even
with the Enemies of the State. The A-
poftles and their Difciples confined riiem-
felves to the pure Doctrine they had re-
ceived



1 70 When the Mohammedans

ceived from Jefus Chrift^ they expofed
themfeives to numberlef's Torments in De-
fence of it; they prayed for their Enemies,
nor ever returned Evil for Evil; they
hoarded not Wealth, and whatever the
Believers depofited in their Hands, was
faithfully diltributed to the Poor: Thus
was it the Goipel was firft recommend-
ed to the World.
tfhcRife The firil Arabians were of different
cf Mo- Manners,and had a contrary way of think-
fof™^ hng; but without entering into a Detail of
the perfonal (^alkies of Mohammed their
Prophet, a turbulent ambitious Man ; iet it
fuifice that we draw you the exac\ Picture
of their reputed Saints, and principal
Friends to the Koran. Their whole Re-
ligion confifted in a ferupulous Obfer-
vance of Times of Prayer, Ablutions; in
bellowing of fome Alms, and in fighting
for the Eftabliihment of their Empire.
Their Sermons were very fhort, and when
they came into a Country they declared
themfeives Companions of the Prophet,that
they were come to exhort them to em-
brace the Religion he had taught, and to
root them out if they refufed. Thus was
it the Conqueror of Afric } addreffed him-
felf to the Africans ; and all the Propaga-
tors of this pernicious Se& have always
talked after the very felf fame Rate. And'

from the Gofpel , convinced him That
Mohammed was the Paraclete or Comforter
promifed by Jefus Chrift, that the Monk
embraced Mohammedifm : But fuch Exam-
ples, as liable as they are to doubt, are fo
very uncommon, that nothing can thence
be inferred to fatisfy us they made as
many Profelytes by the Strength of Argu-

Chriftians we have Examples, and even the
A&s of many Difputes upon Religion,

they had nothing to fear in the Sea Ports
of the Indies ; for the native Idolaters
are not apt to take Umbrage at religious
Differences, and have never made it their
Endeavour to draw Strangers into their fe-
veral Se£t.s. The Fakirs or Mohammedan
Devotees were by no means prone to the

a Scrutiny into the Number of their Mar-

nity. It hapned alfo, but feldom in the
Primitive Times, That Dervifes or Fakirs
undertook long Journeys in the Caufe of
Mohammedifm : But when any Prince was
difpofed to embrace it, then they fent for
fome who made an End of inrtrucling
him; and, upon fidore, the Portuguefe
found one of this Sort, who was come to
wafh away the Lees of the old Idolatry in
that Kingdom. The Moors expe£ted to
get by it if they undertook to propa-
gate their Religion; and made them-
felves Matters of the Trade, by promising
to defend the Princes againft their Ene-
mies ; and fending for further Supplies of
their own People, they added to their
Strength, and often reigned Chiefs of the
Ports that had received them as Foreign
Dealers. Sometimes, under the Mask of
Devotion, they perfuaded the Princes, and

the moll confiderable Perfonages to go
Pilgrims to Mecca, or to fend rich Pre-
fents thither } by which means they had
fo advanced their Affairs in the princi-
pal Empories, that, when the Portuguefe
arrived, they tranfa&ed all the Trade of
the Earl. In this flouriirring State, they
without difficulty drew over to them
a great many Perfons, and particularly
Slaves and Merlices, who thereby became
exempt from all Tribute, as they claimed
the advantages at firft granted to the
Mohammedans to allure them into the
Ports.

By thefe Means and Methods did the
Mohammedans propoxate the Koran, which
has ftill more extensively prevailed iince
the time the Mogul Emperors became
Mailers of the Kingdoms of Cambaya,
Guzarat and many others, where this Sect
had not yet admiffion, and where it was
miftrufted, feeble, and in no condition to
make any Attempt.

Now the difference betw r een thefe Mil-
lions and thofe of the primitive Chri-
ilians is obvious, as much as fome mo-
dern Authors have dared to make the
Comparifon ; they are not even to com-
pare to thofe of latter Times.

Fath. Naverette writes that in his time
there were about five hundred thoufand
Moors in China } and believes they had
not been in the Country above five hun-
dred Years, and that they had conlider-
ably multiply ed by Marriages : He adds

that



174 When the Mohammedans

that many of them took Degrees in the Se£t
of Literati, but that the reft confidered them
as Apoftates, whence it is plain they
thought this Seel: incompatible with their
Religion.

By what has been hitherto offered,
we may pretty clearly difcern how the
Mohammedans may have at flrft got in-
to China ; and it feems that they did
not force an Admittance as elfewhere,
but inlinuated themfelves under the pre-
tences of Trade chiefly } and that
the Trade driven by the Upper Tartary
was the moft ufual and expeditious : But
we cannot tell exactly what this Rout
may have been, becaufe not only our
Authors of the middle Ages and the
modern Greeks, but alfo the Arabs and
the Perfians have under the denomina-
tion of Turks and Tartars comprehended
many Nations of difcordant Manners,
Tongues, and Religion, befides that the

The Geographers fpeak alfo of the Sa-
hara or Tahara who poffefled a Country
of forty Days Journey, among whom there
were Chriftians, Jews, Mohammedans, J-
dolaters, and Magi an s or worjbippers of
Fire : Many more are named in Hifto-

jaks, the Alain s, the Karis and ' Markis ;
in fine many numerous Hoards who
were fubdued by Jenghiz-Kban, but who
before obeyed Ung Khan, whom he over-
threw in Battle.

This detail may evince it impoffible to
know what People our Authors and even
the Orientals mean, when they they ufe
the general Denomination of Turks and
Tartars. And if in Europe we are at
fo great a lofs to trace out the ancient
Cities, and the many Nations whofe

Names ftand recorded in Hiftor^, we
rnuft be infinitely more to leek when
we attempt to recover Cities and Conn-
tries ib very . imperfectly known to the
Ancients, who have lo often changed both
Name and Mailer, and who have been
fo harrailed and ravaged by continual
Wars.

Now, as it may be obferved^ among
the People and Nations, io compre-
hended under the general Denomina-
tion of Tartars, there was a great Num-
ber of Chriftians, not only when Jenghiz
Khan erected his Empire but long before
this Epoch : For in the Hiftory of the
Neftorians we read that Timothy, their Ca-
tholic, who fucceeded Handnjajbua, the
fame mentioned in the Chmefe and Syri*
ac Infcription, wrote to the Khan or Em-
peror of the Tarrars and to fome other
Princes of Tnrkefian, exhorting them to
embrace the Chriftian Faith, which he
did together with two hundred thoufand
of his Subjects. We may be lure
thefe People were true Tartars or Turks i
the fame Catholic being confulted by the
Bilhop, he lent into the Country, con-
cerning the manner how he was to
make them keep Lent, and celebrate
the Service ; they being accuftomed to
Milk and Flefh, and unufed to Corn and
Wine. His anfwer was^ that in Lent
they ihould abftain from Flefh; but that
during the fame they might have Milk
as ufual * and that as to the celebration
m they

they fhould abfolutely provide them-
felves with Bread and Wine. From that
time we, in the Ecclefiaftic Notitia of
the Neftorian Church, have a Metro-
politan of Turkefian, one of Tangut, one
of Chanbalig or Cambalu, and one of Ca-
Jhgar and Ncwakat ; as they had Me-
tropolitans they muft needs have had
Bifnops under them * and accordingly we
Abulfar. find one called Mar Danha, in the Hi-
p. zS6. ftory oijenghiz Khan • Mar is conferred
on Saints and Bifhops, and Danha is a
proper Name, very common among the
Neftorians, but not to fignify a Town as
W' yl f Jenghiz Khans Hiftorian mi flakes. The
fchfnp ^ ej k -Arabian Authors agree that Cabal,
18.6. which they place in an extent of Coun-
Abulfed. try they call Banian, whofe Capital was
P- 522. half a Day from Balk, was the laft City
inhabited by Mojlems, tho' pretty much
blended with Chrijfians, Jews, Magians,
or Worjhippers of Fire, and Idolatrous Jn~
dians. Now altho'the Mohammedans were
very powerful in Chora/fan, Chowarazm,
the Mawaralnahra or Tranfoxane, and tho'
among the Turks and Tartars, we juffc
now mentioned, there were thofe who
had received Mohammedifm ; their Num-
ber was but fmall, and unable to ex-
tend their Colonies into China, fo that
tho' in the Courfe of feveral Ages feme
of them may have gone thither by Tar*
tary and have fettled, it is more likely
the body of them went through the //»--
dies. We have taken notice of the Set-
tlements

Perjia and China before, by the Canal de-
fcribed by our Authors : But the way

Indian Conquefts of the Gaznavid Sohans y mir Uh s

Years, was at Gaznab, a City which fome
Geographers make the Capital of a Pro-
vince of the fame Name, while others
place it in the Country of Baniian, and
others in Zablejiaan or Gout : For we
cannot too particularly inform our Readers
who have not applyed to the Oriental
Tongues, That the Eaftern Geographers,
even thofe who are cryed up for their
Accuracy, are feldom of one Mind as to
the Diviiion of Provinces. Ths firfl of

as poffible. So that the great number of

which made it Penal, or unable to win
over the Chincje who may have been more
hard to convince than were afterwards the
Kings and People of the Neighbouring
Iilands, who pro! efled Mohammedifm before
the Portugueje found out the way to them.
The Mohammedan Millionaries have never
been numerous, and of the great number
of Saints of their Seel:, concerning whom
they have long and tedious Stories, not
one Soul ever expofed his Life in the
Propagation of Mohammedifm. This a-
bominable Seel: was eftablifhed by Vio-
lence only, by Slaughter, and the Horrors
of War, and thus was it that it diifufed
it felf over all the Countries fubdued by
Mohammed and his Succeffors. Thus was
it that Taminaddulet Mahmud the Son of
Sab aft akin conveyed it into a part of the
Indies he conquered, lince when it has
infenlibly over-ran the Country, but efpe-
cially lince the Mogul Emperors, defcended
of famerlan, have made public profeflion
of it : Notwithstanding which, there are
ftill a great number of Idolaters in Indo-
fian, and in our Days there are many Ra~
jas or Indian Princes who adhere to their
old Syftem, as do alfo molt of the Pa-
tans or Nobles, the Banians or Merchants,

In the preceding Inquiries we have difcuffed
the Origin of 'Chn ft Hamty and Mohammedifm

hearing that this Stranger and his Compa-

the Superftitions of the idolatrous Nations
and the Mohammedans, had the Curiolity to
pay him a Viiit. Fath. Ricci conducting
him into the Chappel, he there faw a Pi-?
&ure of the bleiied Virgin with the Infant
Jefus in her Arms, and a St. John near at
Hand, and taking them for Rebekah, Ja-
cob, and Efau, thought he knew them:
And after the fame Manner he guelied at

fher put feveral Queftions to him, and by
his Anfwers under ftood he profefled the
Old Law ; and that he acknowledged him-
felf an Israelite, and not a Jew : Where-
upon Father Ricci concluded him a Def-
cendant of the Ten Tribes carried away
into Captivity, and difperfed over the
uttennpil Parts of the Eafi, He mewed

He related that in the City whence he

built at a conliderable Expence : That for
fiVe or fix Hundred Years they had there
preferved the Pentateuch written upon
Kolls, which they held in great Venera-
tion : That at Hamcheu the Capital of the
Province of Cheqaiang, there was ftill a
greater Number of Israelites and a Syna-
gogue ; That fome alfo there were in other
Provinces, but, that being deftitute of Syna-
gogues, they were greatly decreafea in
Number. We are told, that this Jew in
pronouncing fome Hebrew Words differed
irom our Manner, as in Htercfoloim and
Mojeia : He informed them That fume of
his Countrymen underftood Hebrew, and
among the reft a Brother of his : That for
his Part, having, from his Youth up, ap-
plyed himfelf to the Cbinefe Literature,
he had neglected the other : He frank-

obtained his Doctors Degree.

this Jefmt was Father Adam Schall, who
lived above fifty Years in China with great

in the Country, by his Inter eft and by his
Underftandiig, as well as his Succefiors in
the lame Employs, might have difcovered
fomething more than we have concerning
the Jews in China ; but they have neglected
the Thing. It only appears, by what Fath.
Trigaut writes, That their IS umber was not
very great, and that it rather diminifhed
than not, becaule many, to qualify them-
felves for Offices,conformed to the Religion
of the Country: And it is remarkable that
the Jews excluded thole who apply ed
themfelves to the Chinefe Studies, which
were neceiiary to attain to their Degrees;
by which it is plain they thought the
P radices of the Literati not free from
Idolatry; and the Mohammedans, who
were more in Number, thought the fame

Father Ricci who thought thefe Ifraeli-
tes of Caifamfa might be iome Remains of
the ten Tribes tranllated by Sbalmanefer,
does not feem to be much out of the Way.
Benjamin the Jew relates that in the Coun- in term.
try of Nifapor there were fome who pre- p- in-
tended to be of the Tribes of Dan y Zebu-
htn, Afher, and Naphtali: But we want
many particulars to enable us to judge what
there may be in this Notion, or whether
it is a mere Conjecture or no. We mould
have their Books, we mould know which
they admit and which they are not ac-
quainted with: For the Israelites of the
ten Tribes could neither have nor acknow-
ledge the Books of the Prophets which
fo leverely reproach the Kings and People
of Jfrael with their Idolatry; no more
than what was written during and after
the Captivity. Wherefore what Father
tfrigaut relates of the jfavrj That he re-
hearfed the Stories of EJiher and Judith^
gives us to underftand that he knew thofe
Books of Holy Writ, which had been
impoffible if he had not been acquainted
with the other Jews.

But what Rica fays of the Story of
Judith muft not make us fulpefk his Ve-
racity, becaufe that Book is not in the
Hebrew Canon; for the Jews had fome
Knowledge of it as appears by de Voi/uis
learned Preface on the Pugio Fidei, and by
the Hebrew Tranflations of it that have

been printed ; and what is more, the Jews
oi Perjia have a Veriion of it in the Lan-
guage of that Country, whence it may
have reached China,

Father Ricci afterwards fent a Brother
Jefuit) a Chineje born, to the City of Cai-
famfu, to inquire into the Truth of what
the Jew had reported, and he found things
to be exactly as he had faid. He procur-
ed a Copy of the Beginning and Ending
of the Books theie Jews had in their Syna-
gogue; and upon collating thefe Copies
with the Hebrew Pentateuch , there ap-
peared an exacl Conformity of Parages
and Characters between them, excepting,
lays Trigaut, that, according to the ancient
Cuftom, theie Jews had no Points. The
Conformity of Character is a molt certain
Proof that thefe Books were not ol the
firft. Antiquity ; and the Obfervation add-
ed, That they were written without Points
is no Proof at all ; for at this Day the
Pentateuchs written upon great Rolls of
Parchment, as the Jews have them in their
Synagogues, are deftitute of Points. So
that irom fuch uncertain Documents it is
impoifible to fay whether the Jews went to
China foon after the Tranfmigration of the
Ten Tribes, or whether they came after-
wards, as did the Chr'tfiians and Moham-
medans, which is moft likely to have been
the Cafe. For without enlarging on this
Subject, we on all Sides learn That iince

Before- Mobammedifm there were whole

cens, with a Jew called Herb anus, and by

logies and other Authors, we underfbnd

to the Time thereabouts, and to their Hi-
ftorians who have written fince the Rife of
their Empire.

The Jews were perfecuted by the Chri-
ftian Emperors, and efpecially by Heraclius,
who put a very great Number of them to
Death, becaufe, fay the Arabs, he was
admonifhed to beware of a circumcifed
Nation, from whom he had every Thing
to dread : This he conftrued of the Jews,
not dreaming of the Arabs,who were many
of them circumcifed, as were afterwards
thofe who followed Mohammed', for all
the Arabs were not fo. This drove a
great Multitude of Jews into the Domi-
nions

nions of Perjia, where fome of them
had been ever fince the firft Captivity;
and Hiftory informs us that they often
ftirred up thofe infidel Princes againft
the Chriftians : But they afterwards en-
joyed more Liberty under the Mohamme*
dans, who never difturbed them in the
Exercife of their Religion ; which was the
Reafon they multiplyed greatly in all the
Provinces of the Eaft. And when the
City of Bagdad was built by the Kalif
Almanfur, and became the Capital of the
Mohammedan Empire, the Jews fettled
there, and became very wealthy, and
very potent.

They thrived by various Means ; many
of them cultivated the Sciences, particu-
larly Philofophy, Aftronomy, and Phytic;
others concerned themfelves with Trade,
in which the Nation has ever been very
induftrious; and fome got into the pub-
lic Revenues and Cuftoms, as Receivers
and Infpe&ors. In a Word, they became*
fo numerous and fo potent, that as the
Chriftians had obtained the Privilege to
have their Patriarchs, they obtained almoft
the fame for a Chief of their Nation they
called Rap Haggola, or Haggalut, whence
the Arabs have their Ras al Joint, or Prince
of the Exiles, who exercifed the fame Ju-

Jews by this imaginary Prerogative of
their Chiefs, have thought to elude the
genuin Drift of 'Jacob's Prophecy,7& Scepter
jhall not depart from Judah : But Confiantin
I'Emperear in the Preface to his Tranilation
of Benjamin's Travels, takes Notice of
fome Pafiages of this kind, and refutes
them very folidly ; for not to mention that
all their Authors agree They have had
no Prince of the Line of David to govern
them lince the Deftruction of the fe-
cond Temple } the Tellimony of Tra-
vellers, Ancient and Modern, confirm this
Truth beyond all Contradiction : But the
Jews for want of Proofs have embraced
and ever made a great Stir about the firft
Reports which have from Time to Time
prevailed of Jewijh Princes that have been
laid to be difcovered in far diftant Parts.

One of the moil remarkable Inftan-
ces of this kind, was upon the firffc News
that arrived in Portugal of the Difco-
very of the Prefter John or King of
Ethiopia. Thofe who had been fent out
reported that this Prince was of the Race
of Solomon, that all his Subjects were cir-

they abltained from the Flefh of Swine,
and that they obferved many Jewijh Cu-

in fome Parts of his Commentary upon*-
the Prophets, recur to the firft Accounts the
Portuguefe gave of the great number of
Jews they iound in the Indies. The Jews
of Conftantinopk there printed a Spanijb
Tranflation of a pretended Letter from
Prefier John, in Hebrew Characters, and
difperfed it about every where in different
Languages. But the Jews did not long
enjoy their Dream ; for the Portuguefe, go-
ing into the Country, found that as much
as the Ethiopians were wedded to certain
jfudaical Practices, in which fome Writers
have in vain endeavoured to juftify them^
they were neverthelefs Chriftians.

But, to drop this delufory Prerogative, it
is certain the Jews have for many Ages
fwarmed all the Eaft over; Perjia is full
of them, and they had a Synagogue at
Modain, the ancient Sekucia of the Par-
thiansy out of whofe Ruins Bagdad was
partly built ; and when the Jews removed
to this new City, they became very
powerful, and obtained of the Kalifs fuch
Privileges as differed but little from tnofe
the Chriftians were allowed. And parti-
cularly they attained to the Honour of
having a Chief, the fame the Arabs call
Ras al Joint, fo much talked of by Benja-
min and Abraham Zacui, the Author of the
Jukhajftn. Some learned Men of our

own

own Times have doubted of what the
Jews relate of the Ceremony of In-
italling this their Magiftrate, but it is
very true ; and ought not to be reckoned
a flight enfign of Sovereignty. We read
in the Hiftory of the Eafiem Chriftians,
that it was the ufual Cuftom for the Mo-
hammedan Princes to leave them the free
Choice of their Patriarchs ; but the Per-
fon elected, could not be inverted with this
Dignity, till approved by the Sovereign*
There were even Canons which made it un-
lawful for Bifhops to inaugurate or in~
throne a Patriarch till his Election had
been confirmed in public Form, which
thefe Chriftians wifely ordained to obviate
fuch Inconveniences as have frequently taken
Eirth from the Ambition and Jealoufy of
fome private Men. Wherefore, before they
Confecrated or inftalled a new Patriarch,
they, befides the Conge d'Eltre, ufually
brought him into the Soltan's Prefence,
or to the Governor of the Country ; and
when the Election was confirmed, the new
Patriarch was in great State conducted to
the Church, or the Patriarchal Palace.

We find many Inftances of this in the
Hiftory of Egypt y and in that of the Catho-
lics or Nefiorian Patriarchs ; while nothing
of the like is recorded of the Jermjb
Chief. But as they were very rich, and
oftentimes very powerful at the Courts of
thefe Mohammedan Princes, where every
Thing gave way to Gold, it is very likely
they obtained much the fame Honours

conferred on the Chriftians. According-*.
ly if we examin the Recital of Abraham
of Salamanca, and fome other Jews, as
Benjamin and others rince him, it will be
perceived thefe Cafes were almolt the
lame. It is impoffible to fuppofe their
"Writings are iabulous} they do not
prove That the Princes of the Exiles held
any Sovereignty over their own Nation,
nay, their belt Authors ingenuoufly confefs
there was no fuch Thing, if we except pri-
vate Regulations and Orders among them-
feives. So that they were not much better
than Chiefs of Synagogues, or of the San*
hedrtm of latter Times, and coniiderably
inferior in Authority to the Patriarchs^
when it bapned that the Prince confirmed
the Election.

The main Difference between the Chri-
stian Patriarchs and the Jewijh Chiefs,
was, The former were inverted with a
Power over all the Churches within the
Limits of their See, and fuch a one the
latter feem not to have enjoyed. For

been Families who boaited of a Defcent
by that Line. The famous Ifaac Abarbi~
ml was of this Number, who has been
fo kind as to let us know that a Branch
of the Houfe of David migrated into
Portugal,, and that it was his own; this
reflected an Honour on them from the
Jews, but void of all good Authors

It were needlefs then to recur to their
Fables , now a-days fufficiently known,
to inquire after their Origin in the Eaft
and at length in China. It is very
likely fome remains of the Ten Tribes
exifted in the Upper Afia. Ifaac Abarbinel
cites Letters from Jews in the Indies
who laid claim to that Defcent : But as
they had Communication with the reft,they
moffc certainly conformed with them; ib
that tho' we had any particular Tradition,
or Account of a Cuftom, handed down to us
by the former, this Medly would only puz-
zle us the more ; and in Fact we find thatal-
moft all the Eaftern Jews, mentioned in

Obfervance of the Law, and in the Read-
ing of the facred Books, excepting cer-
tain Things we lhall mention in the Se-

rajfan y in the Mawaralnahra, and in the
Provinces farther! remote and neareil bor-
dering upon China, as well as in Afrk,
not to fpeak of Egypt, where they have been
always very numerous. Antony TenreyrOy
a Portuguefe Gentleman, the firft that
travelled from the Indies to Europe by
£ v Land, whofe Book was printed at
Coimbra in the Year MDLX, found of
them at Lar, and other Cities of Per/ia*
in his way. Abulfeda often obferves there
were Multitudes of them in the Indies]
efpecially at Calayata and Cingala , as alfo
at Coulam, according to Marco Polo. Nil-*
veiri fpeaks of them at Modain as being,
fo powerful that in the Year of the Hejra-
DLXXIII, of Jefus Chrift MCLXXVII
they had a warm conteft with the Mo-
hammedans. At Cochin there was a Jewry,
where, according to Diego de CcutOy they
fpoke the ancient Tongue : There were
alio great numbers of them all over Ma-
labar, where they quite peopled fome
Places.

It is certain alfo that for many Ages
pari: they have been very numerous in
Perjia, and all the Provinces which for-
merly depended thereon, or that at pre-
fent belong thereto ; and in all the Parts
where the Perfian Language is fpoken, as
it is in aimoft all the Dominions of the Mo-
gul. This is confirmed by the Yeriions of
the Scripture the Jews have made into
that Tongue, of which the Pentateuch
only was printed, in Hebrew Chara&ers,

at



difcovercd in CHINA. ipj

at Conftantimpk in the Year MDLI. But /
there are almoft all the Books of the
Bible of this Verfion in Libraries, and
particularly in Monf. Colbert's. The prin-
ted Verfion is by the Jews themfelves
fuppofed to be the work of one Rabbi
Jacob, a native of Tits, a famous City in
Chorajfan. We have another to the full
as good ; and this as well as thofe of
the other facred Books is in Hebrew Cha-
racters, a Verfe of the original preced-
ing a Verfe of the Verfion, juft like the
Chaldee Paraphrafes in Manufcript. The
Verfion of the Pfalms, which John Bap-
tift Vecchietij a Florentin Gentleman, got
copied at Ormuz in the Year MDCI, and
which I have among my Books in Per-
Jtan Characters, is from three very ancient
Copies, in Hebrew Letters, whofe various
Readings are between the Lines of the
Text. This is what Vecchietti has taken
care to obferve at the end of the Book,
adding That this Verfion is the more to
be efbeemed as it has fome old Words
ufed by Fardu/Jt, AzraJd and other Po-
ets, wnich being now obfolete prove its
Antiquity.

And what Hill farther corroborates this ;
In thefe Copies, in Hebrew Charac-
ters, you have none of the Corrections
and "Variations the Maforets have intro-
duced into the Hebrew Text, now in the
Hands of the Jews^nd much fewer of thofe
various Readings called Kari or Katib^
as I have paticularly remarked in the

Again, the fame Per/tan Jews have
Books in their Tongue which the others
re j e&, as the Prophecy of Baruch, the
Hiftory of T'obit, and the Additions tq
Daniel^ which are not in the Hebrew.
Many Conjectures might be raifed upon
this Foundation, but nothing certain can
be thence deduced, no more than from
what little we are told by the ancient
Authors above cited. For the Antiquity
of thefe Perftan Tranflations tho* very
great, is not fufficient to determin whe-
ther or no they precede the Revifion of
the facred Books by the Maforets * and,
indeed, that they did not precede theni
appears plain by the Veriion of the Pfalms,
which tho* in fome Pailages it varies
from the Mafirets, there are important
Pailages where it follows them : The
firrl is in the 21 Pfalm the 22 according
to the Jt'dos'j and the 18th Verfe, where
the Jews inftead of Reading T\$!2 (ode-
nwtj as do the Septuagint and Vulgate,
read H&D Jicut Leo. The Per/tan reads
the fame; In the 144 or 145 Pfalm,
which is Abecedary, the 14 Verfe is
wanting in the Hebrew, tho* it ftands in
the Septuagint, the Vulgate and the Syr
riac Veriion which is very ancient, but
is not in the Perfian. As the Syriac is
from the Hebrew Text, and as there is not
the lean: Appearance that it was reformed
by the Greek, it bids fair to have been

once in the Original Text. For there is
no Caufe to be well afligned why in a
Pfalm, whofe Verfes are in Alphabetical
Order, there mould be one Verfe want-
ing, and we not be able to guels at any
Reafon for it ; and efpecially as nothing
of the like is to be obferved in others
of the fame kind. As old then as the Books
in the Hands of the Jews of Perfidy and
the moll remote Provinces of the Upper
Afta, where the Perjian Tongue was
fpoken, may have been, they cannot
have been lb old as the Tranfmigration
of the ten Tribes, nor even as the laffc
Difperiion, when Jeriifakin was deftroyed,
feeing their Books conform in fuch Ef-
fential Points, as thefe we have noted,
with thofe revifed by the Maforets.

It is moft likely then that the Jews
got into China as into all other Parts,
and that they may the more ealily
have done it, if true it be, as Benjamin
fays, That there were about fifty thoufand
of them at Samarcand, from whence they
may have travelled into China.

WhaitU II7HAT our Mohammedan Traveller,

Chinife 6 Sciences, muft feem fo extraordinary as

after fo many Elogies the Modern Tra-
vellers have lavifhed upon the Philofophers
and Philofophy of China. We might at
firft imaginThat illiterate Merchants could
not perceive what has been fince difcover-
ed, and that therefore we are not to mind
them when they prefume to go out of their
Reach, but Men to the learned Men who
know better. But it is not the Miffiona-
ries only that may be fufpe&ed of having
talked a little too largely of the Wit and
Learning of the Chinefe, who have fo done
under a Notion of discovering fuch Truths

which is or has been, has invented, thd they
have all brought forth very great things, the
whole together would not be more excellent and
various than thofe exhibited by the Seres

nefe. This is the Opinion of a Man that
was never in China ; that was unacquainted
both with their Tongue and their Books,
but by Tranflations he could be no Judge
of; and who, as fome of his Friends fay,
was ready to believe every Thing, true or
falfe, that could be told him concerning
China and the Chinefe. Now the Arabian
Authors of thefe two Accounts had been

they often ufe the Word Xangti to denote the

we have a aemonitradve Proof of this in
the Chincfe and Syriac Infcription difcove-
red in the Year MDCXXV, and printed
in the China Illuftrata : For the Syrians,
who ere£ted it as a lafting Monument of
their Million, having been then one hun-
dred and forty-fix Years in the Country,
could not be ignorant of the Tongue, and
could they have found any Word in
Chinefe to exprefs the Sovereign Entity,
they would certainly have ufed it ra-

as the Spaniards have fince done in Ameri-

no Idea of the Supreme Being, or Name to
call him by. And all that has been Jince
produced in the Progrefs of this long

barbarous Iroquois, who certainly had no
Notion of God. We might hearken to a
well meaning MifTionary, who, having
never ftudied the Ancients, fhould be
caught by fuch Ambiguities, and fancy
the Ancients had never once thought of
any Thing of the kind ; but it is hard to
conceive how a Man of fuch vail Reading

That the Pythagoricians, the Platonicians,
Arijiotle, and almoft all the other Greek

have not fpoke of God more intelligibly

This Antiquity being vouched by the
Chimfe only, is not much to be reived on ;
but tho' it were as far backward, as thefe
Moderns would have it, we mull grant
it can add no Sanction to fo frivo-
lous a Syitem as this. But when we
are afterwards told That the Chimfe : Phi-
lofophers pretend thence to derive not
only the Principles of natural Philofo-

it is almoit impoffible to think thofe !
who give out fuch Dreams, are in earnefl

Chinefe in the Philofophic way, is not a
whit better, nor can we entertain any very
great or very favorable Opinion of a Peo-

there are numberlefs Stories in the Per-

in the Writings of the old Pythagoricians,

happily and Ufefully exprefs than the
fmail Number the Chinefe have, which
are not to be underilood but by Para-
ph rafes as obfcure as the Text it felf, and
which it is oftentimes difficult to re-
concile together. Father Intorcetta, Mar-
tini, Rougemont, Couplet, and others have
given us Tranllations of fome of Confnci-
tis's Tracts, and their Cladics, in which
you muft eternally help the Letter, and
great Differences there are between thefe
Fathers and what is cited by Navarette and
other MifJionaries.

Vojfius does not much inilft on their q%e ChU
Philofophic Difcoveries, but for Phy- nefe Phi*
fie he cries them up to the Skies, and f cianU

Pulfe : he would have it that Galen, who
treated the Subject very amply, was quite
Ihort of them : " The Chinefe, fays he,

nor thought the Obfervations of any great
Ufe. But were they as ufeful as is fup-
pofed, it mult be granted That a Know-
ledge of the Pulfe is but a middling Part
of Medicine ; and hitherto the Chinefe have
afforded us nothing to make us fancy
they are as well acquainted with the
Principles of this Art as Hippocrates , or
that they have better explained them than
Galen, and the other Greek and Arabian

Miflionaries as well as their Aftronomical
Pieces, which is now time to fpeak o£

It is upon this Subject that our Mo-
derns have expatiated the moft, pretend-
ing That the Chinefe Aftronomical Tables,
their Cycle of fixty Years, and the Ce-
leftial Obfervations in their Hiftory, are
a Handing Proof that they have furpafled
all other Nations in Aftronomy. This
Notion gained confiderable Ground, when
Fath. Couplet brought Home thefe A-
ftronomical Tables, which had never be-
fore been feen in Europe.

They were firft examined by CaJJini and
Picard,who finding them to agree to a Mi-
nute, with the Tables of Tycho Brahe y began
to miftruft them a little ; and fpeaking of
the Thing to Fath. Couplet, who was a
very lincere Man, he ingenuouily told
them That the Tychonic Tables being by
all Aftronomers allowed to be the moft
exaS, his Brethren had reformed the
Chinefe Tables by them ; which I have
fince heard him fay my felf.

In the Year MDCLXXXVII the fame rtehChe^
Father printed his Abridgment of the ^£ %
Chinefe Chronology, together with the Cy- r^tlWms>
cles and fome Aftronomical Obfervations,
particularly that of the Conjunction of
the five Planets in the Conftellation the
Chinefe call Xe : But CaJJini undertaking
to Calculate this Phenomenon, difcover-
ed an Error in it of five hundred Years j
and the like in the Obfervation of a Win-

ter Solftice, made, according to Martini^
MMCCCXLII Years before the the Birth
of Chrift. This is to be feen at the end
of De la Loubieres Account of Siam y prin-
ted in MDCXCI, where alfo you have
Cajfiriis Opinion of the Chinefe Tables.
" This Agreement between the Chinefe
" and iychonic Tables, aim oft' to a Mi-
a nute, makes us believe they were cal-
c< culated by the Jefaits who have for
" a Century paft refbrted to China, and
u not by the Chinefe. For if they were
4C not indebted to the Tychonic Tables,
a how is it they fo exactly tally with
a each other ? Our Aftronomers of this
" prefent Age, cannot well agree to a
" Minute in the Places of the fixed Stars,
" and we all know that between Tycho's
" Catalogue and the Landgrave of Hejfes,
a undertaken at the fame Time by ex-
" cellent Aftronomers, there is a difference
" of feveral Minutes. It is not likely
ic therefore That the Chinefe Obfervations
" fhould almoft always agree with thofe
a of Tycho to the \ fame Minute. The
Judgment of this great Man may teach
us what to think of thefe Aftronomical
Tables which have tempted fome People
to prefer the Chinefe to all the Ancients
and Moderns.
<fhe Igm- To this Decifion of one of the greateft
rame of the Aftronomers of this Age we may add a
Chinefe ver y na tural way of arguing which every
^hJlrCa- k oc ty mav under ftand : Firft, The Manda-

the-

thematics, whole Bufinefs it was to fix their
Calendar, fucceeded fo ill therein, that not-
withftanding all their Intereft and Intrigues,
they were obliged to transfer the Task
to the Miffionaries, who were odious to
them, both as Strangers and Preachers of
a new Religion. The Chinefe were firft
fet right by Fath. Matth. Ric'ci ; but a few
Years alter wards they were never the wi-
fer ; fo that Fath. Adam Schall was again
obliged to reform their Calculations, and
in fpite of them became Prefident of the
Mathematic Tribunal, and Mandarin of
the firft Order, as were afterwards the
Fathers Verbieft and Grimaldi, It is far*
ther to; be obferved That thefe Miffiona-
ries and their Succeilbrs, were not pro-
feft Mathematicians, or known for fuch in
Europe ; and yet they were able to dif-
cern and confound the Ignorance of thefe
Chinefe Artronomers on whom it was fo
incumbent to confult the Honour of their
Nation, and keep themfelves in Authority.
The moft rational of them were thofe,
who, confeffing their Ignorance, ftudi-
ed Euclid's- Elements, Clavius's Sphere
and fome other Traces, under the Di-
rection of the Miffionaries; and thefe
they read with aftonifhment, which had
never been the Cafe of thofe who had
but the leaft fmattering of the Mathema-
tics.

We are now to difcufs the Grand Point 5 ^ -^-
and that is the Antiquity of the Chinefe ^Jg*
Aftronomy, this is the moft boafted by jp^my

O 5 thole examined.



jjjjj A Differtation on the

thofe who undertake to raife the Chinefe
above all the Nations that are or have
been : Now for the famous Cycle of iixty
Years, in which Martini and Couplet have
ranged the principal Fa&s of the Chi-*
nefe Hiftory, and the Succeflion of their
Emperors. Father Martini led the way,
and Couplet trod in his Footfteps. We
are at a certainty about this Cycle from
a Traft ordered by Ulug Beig, a Tartar
Prince^ deeply verfed in Aftronomy, who
imployed very able Mathematicians to
compile the Aftronomic Tables we have in
Epch Ce- feveral Libraries. John Greaves, a learn*
Uhi. Jo- ed Englijhman, who was both a great
han.Gra- Matter of the Oriental Tongues and an
yn > excellent Mathematician, did in the Year

MDCL print a Treatife, of this fame
Prince's, Of the various Epochs and their
Computations. Therein the Chinefe Epoch
is called the Cataian or Igurian, which e-
qually comprehends the Chinefe y and the;
Tartars all over the vaft Continent of the
Upper AJia ; and Qolius in Conjunction
with Martini have fhewn That the Cathayan
or Catuian Names therein, are Chinefe. This
fame fexagenary Cycle is, by our late
\ Informations, ufed in Siani and the adja-
\cent Countries, who may have borrowed
'it from China,
tfhe Qho- The Greeks had feveral Periods of
w>iogy ac- Years ; but as they doe not feem to have
wording to b een known to the Arabs, the Per/tans,
fair* or t ^ le ^ artars -> w ^o would have commu-
nicated them to the Chimfe> it were a

pre*



CHINESE Learning. %ij

preemption to deny them the Honour
of having invented the Period before
us ; but we have two very weighty Re-
marks to make upon this Head.

The Firft is That after the Rate Mar-
tint and Couplet have marfhalled the Chi-
nefe Chronology by thefe Cycles of iixty
Years, either the Chinefe or they murl
have been egregioufly out, there being,
as has already been obferved, two Pa-
rachronifms of above five hundred Years
apiece difcovered therein ; which makes
us think it poffible there may be more of
them, if fome skilful Man would but
give himfelf the trouble of examining in-
to all the Eclipfes and Planetary Con-
junctions they give us. But this done 9
there would be ftill another Obffcacle in
our way : for after the ingenuous Con-
feffion or thofe who give us thefe
Tables, That they rectified them by
thofe of Tycho, we fhould be at a lofs to
know whether they are the Obfervations
of the Chinefe, or of that great Aftro*
nomer.

The Second Remark is by no Means of M* '*»»«*
lefs Moment : They exhibit this Series of^J^\
Cycles as a plain Evidence of the Accura- thefe* cl--,
cy of the Chinefe Science, and a Demon- chs.
fixation of the Truth of their Hiftory.
But for this to be true, we lhould have
iome certain Epoch to count from, fuch
as that of Alexander, of Ifdejerd, of JD/o-
ckjian, of the Hejra, and di Jelahddin Ma*
o q he



he Shah; whereas they begin this Suc-
ceffion of Cycles from the Year MMDC
XCVII before Chrift. Now according to
iff the Hebrew Copies and the Vulgate, there
v are but JVLMCCCXXIX Years between the
Flood and the Birth of Chrifi; and to
fupply this Defect it is, that thofe who
ailert the Antiquity of the Chinefe Hiftory,
recur to the Greek of the SeptuaginU They
agree indeed that what is recorded in the
Chinefe Annals above Fohi r is fabulous, and
no Soul doubts of it • fo they dare not af-
cribe this Sexagenary Cycle to him, but
bring it down to the Reign of Hoamti y
who flouriihed the abovefaid Number of
Years before Chrift. But we ihall not
readily conceive how fo very complex
a Cycle as this mould have been fo foon
difcovered, or brought to Perfection as
Couplet * advances ; whereas Martini \ tells
vis that Emperor himfelf invented it. This
Difagreement between two Authors who
had one and the fame Drift, who wrought
with the fame Materials, and in Points of
fuch Importance, makes us very much mi-
itruft the Hiftory they fo applaud. Turn
this Fact which way you will, you mutt
eternally be at a Stand.
It is jfrk The firjt and main Difficulty is how to
culture- reconcile it with Scripture, even with the

CHINESE Learning. 2 j?

Septttagint itfelf ; and this not only with
Regard to Chronological Suppurations,
but in Things of greater Confequence } for
if we admit the Chinefe Hiftory, we niuft ,
reject the Univerfality of the Deluge, not \
to fay that it attributes many Inventions ;
to the Chinefe Emperors, which Scripture
afcribes to others. This has been an Ob-
fervation made by late Authors, and parti-
cularly by the ProtefrantSywho adhere to the
Hebrew Text, and therein agree with the
Catholics, who acknowledge the Authority
of no other than the Vulgate. Both the
one and the other are moil afluredly more
ancient than the Chinefe Hiftory as it fbands
with us ; feeing they have none but printed
Copies extant* and as old as the Chinefe
may boait their Invention of Printing, no
Paper could laft eleven or twelve Hundred
Years. They have no Books fo old, and
w r hen they have found an old Infcription
they have not underftood it, as is inrtanced
by Father Rougemont.

We ihall always be at a Lofs then to ^ e fi c y~
comprehend how the Chinefe fhould have ZToidl
regulated this intricate Cycle two Thoufand petendel
fix Hundred and Ninety-feven Years be-
fore Chrift j and much lefs how they
Ihould have contrived to teach it to others
at a Time when they were very imperfecl
in Arithmetic, invented, as fays Martini, Hifi. Sin.
under the fame Hoamti, by Means of a p. at
Contrivance he reprefents. But after all,
as exact and circumftantial as this Cycle
appears to be^ it was fo defective, that

five



j£i8 A Diflertation on th$

five Hundred Years after Hoamti, the Chi**
nefe Aftronomers could not foretel an E-
clipfe which hapned under the Emperor
Choukangy who for that Reafon put them
to Death. It is to our Purpofe, that their
Hiftories differ about the Time of this E-
clipfe 5 a plain Indication of the Ineffici-
ency of their Calculations. Many Exam-
ples of the fame kind might be produced,
and the like have been very frequent in
latter Times ; for what reflected fo much
Refpecl on the Miffionary Jefuits, was
their Accuracy in thefe Predictions, while
the Cbinefe themfelves were out.
*fht poht ^^ e fe con d Remark we have to make
cf qhne PP° n this Cycle is,That thofe who brought
they are d^ : jit to Europe and made it the Standard of
dmcedfrom^xhQ Cbinefe Chronology, date it from the
r^/pteign of Hoamti MMDCXCVII Years.
i^«W v before Cbrifi^ or twenty-eight Years after-

$M ™ when a great Mathematician called &anao %

that have already been made to this early
Epoch, fo irreconcileable with Scripture,
we. have another ; for Father Martini was
the firfl that ever deduced thefe Sexa-
genary Periods from that Point of Time,
| which the Cbinefe themfelves difown, and
is merely of European Invention. For

to the Year of our Mr* MDXCIV, and
foine of them made very great Additions
to this enormous Number. And yet this is
not to compare with what we read in Ulug
Eeig,who has treated more exactly of thefe
Cbinefe Cycles, than any Body elfe whatfo-
ever : He tells us that in the Year of the
Hejra DCCCXLVII, of Gbrift MCCCC^&Cfc'
XLIV, the Catalans or Cbinefe computed le ^
Eighty-eight Millions, fix Hundred thirty
nine Thoufand, eight Hundred and fixty
Years from the Beginning of the World ;
which infinitely exceeds the immenfe Cal-
culations of the old Cbaldees and Egyptians^ ■
fo juftly rejected as fabulous by Cicero and
other Authors, and which none have afler-
ted but Libertins and the Author of the
Preadamitic Syjtem.

Thofe who have favored us with Com- *fhm <7V*-

it fabulous till the Reign of Hoamti : but »™fi«»*
tell us that alter his Days we are to rai i„ an

prove by a Series of thefe Cycles chiefly, Work than
according to which they compute the Years *Chinefe,

Chinefe Tables, tho' reformed by lycho^ are
falfe. This is the Opinion of Mr. Co/fini,

Words it may not be amifs to produce:

a vary about ten Degrees ; Father Mar-
a tint fixing it in the fifteenth Degree of

a ded ten Degrees fince Martini wrote.
cc It is certain i that a great many of the

" Chinefe give as obferved, cannot have.

the Thing, That he asks, What the
Europeans have to ,fay to it? Mr. Caffini
has on the behalf ot all Europe replyed,
That this firlt Obfervation is falfe, and fo
all the Confequences thence deduced mull
fall to the Ground.

After this we may judge if Vojjias could ACovfe
iuftlv include the Altronomy of this Peo- ^ ence
ple when he prelumed to lay 01 them, ^ uc n,jg m
That they alone had invented moreThings •
ufeful in Life, in the Arts, and the Sci-
ences than all the Nations of the World
put together. For we can know their Ob-
servations but by the Tables we have; and
fince thofe who turned them into Latin re-
formed them by Tycho \ iince the Con-
junctions and Eclipfes they contain prove
falfe ; and iince by the Help of tliefe Ta-
bles, rectified as they are, they have, for a
Hundred and fifty Years pari, never been
able to fettle a Calendar, or.ioretelan E-
clipfe; we mull pronounce them far infe-
rior not only to the great Aftronomers
that have graced our Days, but to the
very meaneft, fuch as were moll of thofe
who put them into fome certain Method.

And far lefs are they to be compared ^ he Chi-
with or preferred to the Greeks, whofe A- ne ^ e ^^

wherein no fuch Thing as an Anachronifm wttb the

ftry of our own Aftronomers. Nor can the

found Principles of the Mathematics, in the
Greek Writings, improved them fo well,
that when our Authors went to China they
had able Geometricians and Aftronomers,
whofe Tables and Obfervations ferved as
a Rule to all Europe for many Ages toge-

be drawn up in the Year MCCLXX : To
do which he employed fome learned Jews,
as is obferved by the Hiftorians who fpeak
of this Event : But they have not obferved
to us That thefe Jews were beholden to
Tables which had a long Time before
been prepared by Arabian Mathematicians,
the moft ancient of which were calculated
at the Command of the Kalif Ahnamun,
the feventh of the Abbaffids, who got
moft of the Greek Books translated into
Arabic.

nbmers, called the Children of Mufa, made Ebn Ka^
that famous Obfervation on the Meafure of likan -
Earth, which they firft did in the Plains
of Sinjar, in Scripture Shinar, and which
they afterwards repeated at Kufah. A
little while after this, they had very learn-
ed Aftronomers, among the reft Abuabdallah
Miihamed, the Son of Jaber, who calcu-
lated Aftronomical Tables very exactly, as
did many others down to Jelaloddin Make

regulate the Epoch called Makkean or Jela- fJw^db

underftood Arabic, it being common in the Ulug.Be-
Country, while the Moors- were Matters of %• %<*e.
Corduba, Granada, and many other confi- ^M' f
derable Cities- had tranflated the Aftrono- p ix [ e ~
mical Books and Tables of the Arabian
Mathematicians into Hebrew, as well as
moft of thofe that treated of the Sci-
ences in general, which gained thern
great Credit and Reputation, After this
there was a great Number of very learned
Aftronomers among the Mohammedans, and
Ulug Beig, a Tartar Prince, having caufed
very nice Obfervations to be made at Sar-
tnarkand, ordered the Tables called Ilaka-
nian to be formed, which have been admi-
red even by the Aftronomers of our Age.
They did not, like the Chinefe, miftake in
their Calculations, they never obtruded
falfe Eclipfes, they never were at lofs to
fix the Beginning of their Years, tho', as
they reckoned by Lunar. Months, it is

more

more difficult to compute them than the
Cbinefe Cycles ; and by what Uhtg Beig fays
j of the Matter, he feems to have known
the Myftery of thefe fame Cycles better
than the Mathematic Mandarins themfelves.
We muft not wonder then that Mohamme^
dan Travellers from Bagdad, the Abode
of the Kalifs, who were fenfible how well
thefe Sciences were cultivated in their own
Country, ihould, upon obferving nothing
like it in Cbtna, pronounce the Cbinefe igno-
rant of the fame.

ftbe Arabs We mi & ht here exhibit a lon S. V 1 ^
were great °f Arabian and Per/tan Mathematicians
Jdathema- from Almamun down to later Times • and
titians* their Works being extant and in our
Hands, we find them to have been perfect-
ly acquainted with all the Branches of the
Mathematics. They had tranilated Euclid
from the Beginning, and their Comments
upon him convince us they underftood
him thoroughly ; fo they tranilated Arcbi*
medes, Tbeodojius, Apllonius Perg<zas y and
almoft all the other moffc difficult Authors;
and by their Demonstrations it appears,
and by their Schemes That they were fully
poffeifed of them, and that they made
very intricate Calculations to the greateft
truth. We muft coniefs then that in this
RefpecT; they were far beyond the Cbinefe
who have had fuch Wonders told of them,
Wonders not confirmed by a long Series of
Time, or by Perfons not to be miftrufted,
but by a Handful of prejudiced Europeans,
Tranilators, and Reformers, as they them-
felves



CHINESE Learning. 22$

felves confefs, of Books they could hot
underftand. If the Chinefe had been but
middling Geometricians, Euclid's Elements
had not been fo novel to them } if they
had been grounded in the Principles of A-
rithmetic, they had long ago thrown away
the Frame or Mechanical Contrivance
they ftill ufe; by whole Affiftance it is
hard to conceive how they fhould have
calculated their Cycles with as much Exact-
nefs as the Perfians did, who actually knew
them, or as Greaves has done it for us in
his Epochs Celebrires.

Now if we take in Hand the Arts that rt* Chi-
depend on the Mathematics, we mall at nefe«»<K>
the firft Glance perceive the Chinefe are not ^ith^he
only far inferior therein to the Greeks, and j rts t { at
the Moderns \ but alfo that they are quite depend on
ignorant in Optics, Proportions, Painting, theMath^
Sculpture, Architecture, and in general maUcs -
every Thing that tends to the Improve-
ment of the fine Arts. We cannot appre*
hend that any Body will compare the Chi-
nefe Buildings, not even their Triumphal
Arches, no nor the Porcelane Tower, with
the noble Remains in Greece and Italy. If
you will go ftill farther back, there is Shih
minar, which many take to be the old
Perjepolis ; The Ruins of this far exceed
any Thing to be feen in all China. But if
it is thought too much that we compare
the Chinefi Architects with the Greeks, the
Romans, and the ancient Perfians, compare
them with the Americans, m<i they will ftill
be inferior ; For what Authors of undoubt-

they Ihould have completed fuch vait
Works as they did,without the Ufe of Iron.
As thefe never had lb great an Opinion of
themfelves as the Chinefe have had, and
were never Ihy of learning what they
knew not, they in a very lhort Time at-
tained to a Perfection in the Arts, as may
be read at large in Palafox* This we can-
not fay of the Chinefe, who in a Hundred
and fifty Years Time, have not learned to
make a Dial,or draw a Figure. But welhall
refume their Arts hereafter} we are now go-
ing to touch on one of the principal Parts
of their Philofophy, which is Morality.
tffceChi- . This is one of the Articles late Au-
nefe J/o- thors are prolix upon, particularly extol-
?ahty. Y[ n g the great moral Truths which fo Urine
in the Works of Confucius, the moffc famous
of all the Chinefe Philofophers, honoured
by the Literati as a Saint, and whom many
compare with, nay prefer to the greateit
Genius's of Antiquity* For a long Time
we knew nothing of this Treafure but by
loofe Sentences, in Martini and others, till
; ,njhe Year MDCLXXXIH, when Couplet
gave us a Tranilation of the Works of this
Philofopher, or rather a Paraphrafe upon
it, without which it had been imporlible to
make Senfe thereof When we attentively
confider thefe Works, we find it a difficult
Matter to give a more natural Account

of



CHINESE Learning. 227

of this Philofophy than Lorenzo Magdhtti^
and Carlo Ddti, Florentine, very ingenious
and learned Men did upon the Conference
they had about China vith the Jefuits
Gruehcr and Orville, who were juft returned
from thence, E una Jpecie di Filofophia mor~>

common to all Nations as to China } and
when explained more amply by Interpre-
ters and Commentators, they generally tend
to trifling Ceremonies, and frivolous Su«
perfHtions* This it were eafy to, demon-
ftrate, if we had leave to examin the chief
of them, even the moft marvellous; but as
this would require a Volume by itfelf, let
it fuffice that we attempt a few important
Obfervations upon this Chapter.

No Body can deny but that all the great Mrai
Truths in Confucius, are more happily ex- truths of
prefTed, and more plainly taught in the C °^ JC 7 1U$
Scripture: His Friends to .be lure would ^nuiMnk
never allow him to be beholden to the of them.
facred Books, or that he thence ex-
haufted his Lights, and indeed it feemshe
did not ; for had he, in the leaft, known
the Truths revealed to the Patriarchs and
People of God, he had never contamina-
ted thofe afcribed him, by fuch great Ab-
furdities. And yet it is not impoffible but
fome feeble Rays may have reached China,
thro* other Nations } for the Antiquity of
the Sacred Writings, is as certain as that
of the Ghinefe is doubtful : But up©n this
Head we have wherewithal to fuggeft,
p z That



%i$ A Diflertation en the

That moffc of thefe Truths fo afcribed to
the Chinefe and to Confucius, are not of
their own Growth, and that they had
them from abroad.
Mofi of There is hardly any Truth in Morals

thefe J but is to be found in the old Gnomics, in
<f ruths an the Golden Verfes of Pythagoras, in the
w the old Mayings of the Seven Wife-Men, and in the
fcattered Fragments of the Pythagorics.
Now it is certain That the Arabs tranflated
moil of thefe old Collections of Sentences,
and that the fame were afterwards rende-
red into Per/tan ; fo it may have been That
by this Means they made their Way into
China; and that the exceffive Vanity of
the Chinefe may have prompted them to
call that their own, they had only borrow-
ed. For it does not appear by any Author,
Ancient or Modern, That the Arabs or
Perfeans ever had any Thing from the
"Chinefe, not even Fables: In their fabu-
lous Pieces mixed with Morality, as Kalila-
ve Damna, and others fuch, the grave
Perfons introduced to pronounce Sentences

The Writers who have given us Extracts
from their moft famous Authors, have beeif
very brief upon this Head,feemingly aware
That if it was explained we fcould therein
dii'cover fomething like the Do&rin of the
old Maaichees, or thole the Arabs call Tan-
wisy becaufe- they admitted two equal Prinr
cipies, the one Good the other Evil : But
in Head of this, ibme have thought them

u The Knowledge of Man, according to
a the fame Author, comprehends Morality,
# Piety towards God, towards our Parents,
P towards all Men, and towards ourfelves.
If we. believe Martini, the Chinefe by this
Piety, recommended in the Books of Con-
fucius ^ underrland " The Love of God, of
4 * our Relations, of our felves, and of all
f c Men." But how ihould the Chinefe have
prefcribed Rules for the Love of God, and
not at this Day have any Notion of him,
no Naine to fignify this Supreme Entity
we are bound to adore and to love as foon
as we know him the Author of all Things,
and of all Good. He endeavors indeed
%o make the Words Thien and Xamti ex-
preflive of our Idea of God ; "but this
Point has been rnoft minutely difcufled in

long Detore this Deciiion at Rome, Navar,
rette and other Millenaries maintained
That the Cbmcje did net accept thefeWords
jn Mar Urn's Seine, that they had no Idea
pf the true God, nor Name for him.

It follows then That this Piety towards
God is not what Martini Would have it,
but what the Chinefe practice. Now what
they practice, are Sacrifices, in theirWay,
offered up to Heaven, to Genii, and their
ancient Heroes; to Confucius, Laoffu, and
to Foe or Fohi, one of their firft Emperors,
whofe Story is quite Fabulous, And
herein confifts the primary and principal
Part of the Chinefe Piety, void of any Ve-
ftige of true Worihip, the Sum and Sub-
fiance of Religion : But befides the un-
doubted Proofs we have of this, in the moft
lincere Travellers,we have fpeaking Proofs .
thereof in the Pictures we fee in theirBooks; p^in. &:
for above all the reft you have the Picture U ' '
of Fohi, and very far beneath you have
thofe of Confucius and Laojfu. Now Fohi y
according to the Chinefe, was one of their
old Emperors; according to the Indians^
one of their Gods. The two others were
their Saints, and great Philofophers; and
before thefe Figures do the Chinefe offer
Flowers, Perfumes, living Creatures, and ■
other Things ; in this confifts the Piety of
the learned Chinefe. If the Idolatry of the
People be more iimple and groveling, and
if the Idolatry of thefe Grandees be more
polite and refined ; they are never the lefs
equally Criminal,and equally Superftitious :

no idolatrous Nation has pufhed the

mean Train to be the Refult of Philofo-
phical Meditation, and, as it were, founded
upon the original Principles of Wifdom.

The ancient Greeks and Romans were q-^ e Qil-
unhappily involved in the grofTefl Super- nefe Cere-
ftitions : but they were far from being ap- monies hut
proved by the Philofophers, tho' few of %%f™
them ventured to attack them openly ; ^.^
they left the People to their Sacrifices, their
FeitivaJs, and all their religious Trum-
pery; the wifeft Legiflators gave Way
to thefe popular Errors. But if they hap-
pened to ordain a Sacrifice or any reli-
gious A £1, they did not derive it from Phi-
lofophic Reafbning ; they had Recourfe
to Oracles, to Revelations, which the
Philofophers always rejected, if we except
the latter Times ; when to maintain them-
felves in the Veneration of the People,
and as much as poffible to deter them from
Chriitianity, they carryed the Error to
its utmofl Length. If then we are to fay,
as by all Accounts it feems we mure, That
Confucius and the other Sages of China
taught the ridiculous Ceremonies in vogue
with the Chinefe^ and confidered the fame
as conftituent Parts of Morality and Piety,

what the Chinefe underftand by the other tms accor 7 d
Virtues, which lead to this Piety of Cere- chinefe

which we meafure the Senfe of others. We
muft not wonder That thofe who had learnt
no -better after fo long a Study, fhould ad-
mire the Philofophy of Coimbr a : Or that

on fuch abfurd Diftin£t.ions \ nor can any
Thing be more out of the way, than to
make a Virtue of what they call Meafuring
the Senfe of others. If thefe enigmatical
Words are expreffive of any; Thing, they
mean the Talent of diving into the
Thoughts of others, of gueffing at their
good and evil Intentions, of getting at
their Capacity, and of thence forming a
prudential Judgment, according to which
we are to behave. But this is not having
the primary or fimple Idea of Virtue, to
apply it to fuch a Character ; for a cunning,
inquifirive, miftruftful, artful, designing
Man, is for the generality better able to
Meafure the Senfe of other s y than an honefiy

nefty ; the Fury wherewith they lay vio-

Mind; which, as they fay, has been upon
them for above two thoufand Years pall :
Tho', by the way, this their Attachment
to Chemiftry, makes their Antiquity look:

very doubtfuL For notwithstanding the
Fables the Chemifts have forged among
themfelves, to prepoflefs us with a Fancy
That their Art took Birth from the Patri-
archs and Sages of the firft Times, it was
never heard of before the third Century of
Cbrift. Moil of the Learned have taken
the Word Chemiftry to be of Greek Ety-
mology jbut they are wrong, the Word be-
ing no where to be met with in ancient
Authors, and being written with an H ?
whereas it mould be fpelt with a r to
be Greek. It is on all Hands agreed that
the firft Books of this frivolous Art, that
we know of, appeared firft of all in Egypt ^
and that, as feveral relate, under the Empire
of Dioclejian. &»/« is Egypt in the Lan-
guage of the Country, where it is pro-
nounced Kimi ; whence the Arabs^ who are
as much infatuated with this Spell as any of
the Orientals, have formed the Word
Chimia. It is very likely then That by
their Means it was the Cbinefe became ac-
quainted therewith, there being, as fhall
be obferved hereafter, no ftrefs to be
laid upon their Hiftories. The modern *
Greeks have many Treatifes of this kind,
which tiiey fet off with pompous Titles,
to perfuade us they are very Ancient :
Thefe the Arabs and the Per/tans have
tranflated, and afcribed to Hermes^ to Py~
thagoras, to Arijiotle^ and to other great
Perfonages of Antiquity; but we have no
Arabian Writer (and they are no very fcru-

After Morality come Politics, as one

fufficiently admire That Men veried in
Antiquity, as many were who have
fo extolled the Chinefe, fhould fo empha-
tically in lift on the Sentences of Confuci*
us and Menciusj which are fo very trite,
that the heft of them are not comparable
to thofe which in a manner fill the Greek
and Latin Writings, not to fpeak of Scrip-
ture which contains more political Truths
than the whole Clafs of Profane Authors.
But if the Chinefe Philofophers have utter-
ed fome fine Sayings, It does not ap-
pear they have contributed much to the
forming of great Princes, or able Minifters ;
to the Rife of wholfom Laws, or to make
the People happy. For many Ages it has
been a faying, The People would be happy if
Kings were Philofophers^ or if Philofophers
reigned ; and we may fafely fay That if
Philofophers ever reigned in any Country,
China has been the Place. For the Manda*
rinsj who are all Men of Letters, and con-
fequently Philofophers, Difciples, and Fol-
lowers of Confucius ; have for many Ages
paft filled all the great Offices, both
Civil and Military, have enjoyed all
Governments, and prefided in all Tri-
bunals. And yet if we fearch into
the Hiftory of this Empire, embellifhed
as much as poffible by fruitful Pens,

of any great Ufe in the extraordinary
Revolutions that have hapned in their
Country, or that they have exhibited iuch
Examples of Fidelity and Courage as a-
bound in the Hiftory of every other Na-
tion. This is particularly obfervable in
the very laffc Revolution, when the Tar~
tars made a Conquer! of China^ and placed
the reigning Family on the Throne. In
ihort, all the Defects which have been
deemed the Ruin of the great Empires
of the Earl:, defpotic Rule, the Luxury of
the Prince fhut up in a Palace with Wo-
men and Eunuchs, the Neglect of State
Affairs, the Contempt of Military Arts;
all thele infect the Government of
China. The Tartars without one jot of
Philofophy over-ran this vaft Empire
almoft as foon as they invaded it ; but
when they conformed to the Chtnefe Ways,
they flood expofed to the fame Misfor-
tunes as their PredecefTors. ^r havt

fucius to have been a Man infpired of God,
and that he forefaw the Birth of Chrijt y
becaufe in his Days certain Hunters killed
an uncommon Creature which looked
fomewhat like a Lamb. The Holy Patri-

have thought, and will upon better Founda-
tion think, That this Condefcenlion is ra-
ther adapted to confirm them in their old

of the Way he is to be truly worfhipped,
mould reveal himfelf in the Old and New
Teftament to plain illiterate Men without the
Intervention of Philofophy, and that to this
general Rule of Providence there fhould
be an Exception for China, And it is ftill
more unworthy of the Divine Majefty to
fuppofe any Infpiration in Men who had
no Knowledge of his Supremity, of the
Soul, of the Origin of Things, and who
for two thoufand Years paft have perfifted
in vain and frivolous Tenets. The Moham-
medans with the bare Knowledge of an Al-
mighty God, the Creator of Heaven and
Earth, the Author of all Good, the Judge
of the Quick and the Dead, the Avenger
of wicked, and the Rewarder of good
Works, could not but exprefs themfelves
of the Chinefe with the Contempt obierv-
able in our two Voyages, a Contempt
of ancient Date with the Arabs } for in
Hircory we read of a Saying which came
from Mufa, who conquered Spam, to the
following Effefit : When Wifdom or Know-
ledge was fent down to Men, /he was lodged

own Tongue and Eloquence ; but they
yeilded the Greeks the Honour of having
iurpafled them in Philofophy and the Scien-
ces, tho' they would never allow the Chinefe
to have been any thing but ingenious Me-
chanics. Vojfius and the Authors of la-
ter Times, have not been unmindful to
extol them as fuch, and at the fame time
allow them to be the Inventors of many
ufeful and curious Things, which is not io
certain as to be beyond all Difpute. For
it will never be readily granted That
they found out the Compafs, and the Art
of Navigation. The Antiquity of Print-
ing among them is afTerted from the Te-
ftimony of their own Hiftories only, which
are much to be doubted, as is alfo the
Claim they lay to the Invention of Ar-
tillery and Gunpowder, the Conftruction
Martp.44 °f Celeftial Spheres and Globes, together
with other Items of a Mathematical Ap-

and if their firft Inventors be as old as is
fuppofed, it were aftonifhing That if we
except their Varnifh and Porcelane, every
thing elfe attributed to them fhould be
in iuch a State of Imperfection. For the

Miffi-

Miffionaries inform us, they were obliged
to get Mathematical Initruments made to
oblerve with, becaufe what the Chinefi
had of the Kind would not. do. As
much as they are pretended to ha\e been
skilled in calling of Cannon, Father
Adam Schall and Martini were at the Head
of all the Meltings in their Time ; and
notwithstanding what is commonly faid
That the fevere Prohibition againfb Infrin-
gements on the ancient Ufages,or receiving
Inrtru£tion from Strangers, has prevented
them from improving the Arts they inven-
ted ; thefe Strangers have taught them an
infinit number of Things, before unknown
in the Country. We muft then confine
our Elogies on the Cbinefe, to what they
have actually invented and cultivated, ani
not extend them to Inventions which are
none of theirs 5 for it can only ferve to
confound Hiftory, make us doubt of the
Authority of Holy Writ, and adminiiter

they want the Sound of fome of our
Letters as R, and fome others. Thofe
who have impartially confidered this Mat-
ter, have agreed it to be a very grievous
Defect, and it is ealily conceived : For one
and the fame Noun, and one and the fame
Verb, admitting a great variety of Moods,
of Tenfes, of Numbers, may always be di-
ftinguiihed with us, becaufe the Characters
never vary. But this Multiplicity of Cha-
racters is what Voffius would have us moffc
admire, adding 'That hence their Tongue
has fuffered no Alteration for three or four
thoufand Years paft, and that thus they
xnurl have retained all the Difcoveries their
ancient Sages had made in the Sciences
and fine Arts, as well as the Hiftory of
their Empire. Thefe great and founding
Words ftrike us at firft, efpecially when
delivered with that Air of Authority Vqf-
fius aflumed, when fpeaking of Things he
knew the leaft of; but if we examin them
nicely, we fhall find that what they figni-
fy is quite falfe. For jirft he takes it for
granted that the Chinefe Characters have
always been as they are at prefent ; fecond-
ly, that they underftand them as readily
as a Gnek would read an old Infcription,
or a Jew the Hebrew Bible, which is a
Miftake. He might have informed him-
£-*3- felf from Martini^ That the ancient G&-
nefe Characters differed widely from the
Modern, and that they were not very un-
like

like the Egyptian Chara&ers upon the Obe«
lisks at Rome. He adds, That he once
favv a Book written in fix feveral Sorts of
thefe old Symbols, which the Chinefe va-
lued and admired for its Antiquity : But
he does not fay they understood th6m, and
there is great Reafon to believe they knew
no more of them than of the Infcription
mentioned by Rougemont^ who frankly
confefTes That no Body could explain it.
Thefe Characters were ftrange to them,
and confequently the Tongue had under-
gone a Revolution, which overthrows
Vojfius's Argument.

But when he takes the Chinefe Books to
be fo very old, he advances a decifive
Fact without affording us any one Proof of
it. He himfelf could furnifh us with none,
for he was ignorant of the Language j nor
could he pretend to fay any Thing he had
not from Martini and others. Thefe have
indeed affirmed the Chinefe Hiftory to be
very Ancient,and feem unwilling we ihould
doubt it; but they have never faid They
had any Books fo very Old ; nay they even
fupply us with a confiderable Argument
againrt. this boafted Antiquity, by telling
us more than once That they have none
but printed Books ; and altho* they dis-
agree about the Time when the Art of
Printing was invented, no one has given it
out to be as Old as the earlier! Times of

was known in Europe. It is alfo on all

they omit moll of the Vowels, which are

Comparifon of the Chinefe Writing, which
cannot be mattered but by a long and te-

never find that the Greeks and Latins were
obliged to ufe the Pen to be underftood in
immediate Converfation together, as the
Chinefe are forced to do with their Pencil :
This is what Trigaut exprefly obferves
from Rica's Memoirs: For having laid
that each Word has its Hieroglyphic, and
that there are as many Letters as Words ;
that they are to the number of Seventy or
Fourfcore Thoufand ; and that the Perfon
who understands ten Thoufand has as
many as are neceflary to write, and that

dred Thoufand, and perhaps, a Hill great-
er number if we took in the Variations of
the different Dialects, and if we thereto
added the vulgar Tongue, as the Chinefe
reckon the ancient and modern together.
If to this we accumulated all the Inflecti-
ons of Nouns and Verbs, which have each
a Character apart in the Chinefe Writing,
the Number would infinitely furpafs that
of the Chinefe Characters. The fame might
be alledged of the Latin y and ftill more
of the Arabic, the Perjian, the Armenian
and moll of the Oriental Tongues.

Accordingly, as the Chinefe have thought
it beneath them to learn any Thing of
Strangers, the few who were rational
enough to fubmit to the Inftruction of the
Miflionaries, have been obliged to ufe, or
to form an infinite number of new Words,
and confequently new Characters, or it is

confefs the Chinefe Tongue to be very
imperfect,as well in the Pronunciation, as in
the Writing* and that the ancient Hebrews

Beginning extend this admirable Inven-

other Nations with lefs than thirty Figures

to fettle their Pronunciation, or the Senfe

€fheChan- ^ ne Experience of many Ages allures
ges of Pro- us it is impoflible to fix any Pronuncia-

Idngun- derns; tho* we can neither difcover the

cannot doubt but that the ancient Greeks
pronounced the B like the Latins^ and yet
they for many Ages pari have been obliged
to ufe the Conjunctive /^tt, to exprefs the
Power of that Letter, efpecially in exotic
Names. A like Alteration has befallen
the Latin Tongue, whofe genuin Pronun-
ciation we rather guefs at than know ; and
by the various Ways the Hebrew Words
and Names are written by the Greek In-
terpreters, and by the MaforetSj we learn
that the fame has betid ed the Hebrew Ton-
gue : But this great Variation has been
no Hindrance to the reading of the old
Greek and Latin Books and Infcriptions, or
the facred Books of the ancient Jews.

thefe laft Words, and needlefs to attempt

much at a Lofs to conceive what Poetry
can be formed out of Monofyllables, which
tor that Reafon mould have but little or
no Harmony ♦ perhaps it is kept up by the
Richnefsand Pomp of Expreffion. In this
we mutt fubmit to the Judgment of thofe
who are Matters of the Tongue, and the
rather as there has been no Nation fo bar-
barous but has had its Poets, and preferred
its Poetry before all others. The Ameri-
cans have their Poetry as well as the Bar-
barians of Afric, the old Gauls, the Saxons,
the Goths, and generally fpeaking every
Nation we have ever heard of, tho' infinit-
ly inferior to the Chinese in point of Civi-
lity. Nor muft we wonder at this Prepo-
fieflion in Favor of our own Country ', for
in our Days the Learned of the North
have beftowed great Elogies on the Runic
Poetry, the Ifelandifh and others fuch. Lu-
doJfus out of his lingular Efteem for the

of their own Eloquence, in which they
imagin they furpafs all other Nations, have
ftill a fonder Conceit of their Poetry ; and
indeed were we to judge of it by their
number of Poems and Poets, no Nation
may compare with them : Were we to collect
all their Pieces of this kind, we actually
know of, they would form a Library of
feveral thoufand Volumes. But they kindled
not their Genius for Poetry from the
Greeks >xogethei with their Tafte for Philo-
fophy, Mathematics, Phyfic, and other
Sciences ; for they feem not to have known
any of the old Poets, tho', according to
fome Authors, Homer was formerly tran- Atmlfa-
flated into Syriac. But the Arabs knew "&_E mir *
fo very little of him, that when they
happen to mention him, which is very fel-
dom, it is as an old Philofopher, not as
a Poet. This Genius obtained in the Na-
tion long before Mohammedi[m\ they fpoke
in Verfe at their public Meetings, in their
formal Vifits, and even in the Field of
Battle. In the firft Ages of their Empire
they had an infinit number of Poems, made

jham the Son of Abdahnalec, Tazid and
Walid, for he lived ninety-five Years ; be-
caufe of his great Skill in the Arabefque y
and becaufe he was particularly verfed in
the old Poets before Mohammed. Another
could repeat eighty thoufand Diitichs of
thefe fame Poets by Heart ; this was the
Emir Afama y who dyed in the Year
DLXXXIV . But Jafar, the Son oiAbdaU
M, who dyed in the Year CCCLXXXIV,
outdid him, he could repeat one hundred
thoufand. Their mofh ferious Hiftories are
full of Verfes, and yet the Rules they are
made by are as hard as the Greek and
Latin, which they feem to have known as
little of] as of the Cbinefe. But tho* the
Chinefe were more barren of Expreffion
and Thought than the Arabian, Perfian,
and Turktjb Bards, who err from our Rules,
they might not be the lefs valuable \ all
that we have faid of their Learning is
not to take away from the Efteem we
ought to have for them, but to reduce their
Merit to its natural Bounds.

The Writers of the laft Age have ftray-
ed too far out of the Way, in preferring
a few faint Sparks of Reafon, and cer-
tain Truths veiled over with Enigma, to
what has been ftarted by all other Nations,
and in offering to excufe the eflential De-
fects of their Philofophy. Thefe exceffive
Commendations might be excufable were
they not productive of dangerous Confe-
quences j but chiefly as they tend to make

us doubt the Authority of the facred
Books, which, fetting aiide Religion,
ought not to be compared with the Chinefe
Hiitory. Thofe indeed who are moft
tenacious for them, give them up in this
refpecl;* but by labouring all they can
to prove and confirm the Antiquity of this
fame Hiftory,the Anfwers they make to Di-
fficulties are much weaker than the Objecti-
ons raifed, and thus they put Weapons into
the Hands of Libertinsand Free-Thinkers.
An Initance of this we have had in the
Author of the Preadamite Syftem, who
tho' as is faid by his Acquaintance, he was
fo ignorant that he fcarce underftood La-
tin, yet having formed a jSyftem by wrert-
ing fome Paflages of Scripture to his own
Mind \ and being informed, by fome, who
had moreLearning than himfelfjofwhat was
reported of the great Antiquity of the Cki-
nefi] and the fame being confirmed by Mzr-
ft»i ? sHirtory,which appeared juft at the fame
Time ;he laid hold on it not only as a very
valid Proof of his own Whims, but alfo of
the infinit number of Years the Myrians y
Babylonians, and Egyptians reckoned, which
the very Heathens themfelves rejected as
fabulous. He met with People who fur-
nifhed him with the Memoirs in his fecond
Dillertation, where the Subject is more
amply treated ; and but too true it is that
many have been infnared thereby; not to
become Preadimites indeed, but to harbor
other Notions equally fubverfive of Religi-
on, For thefe preteaded Antiquities of the

Chinefe infenfibly wipe away the Con-
tempt which not only Chriitians but the
old Philofophers have had for the Egyptian
and Babylonian Traditions. On the o-
other Hand we are told the Per/tans have
Hiftories which go much farther back than
the facred Books ; and tho fuperficial Peo-
ple, Scioliits, and thofe who believe they
know every Thing, becaufe they react
much, do not abfolutely admit thefe Fa-
bles, they yet fuppofe they mult be found-
ed upon ibme fort of Truth. They
dive after this Truth in their wandring
Imagination, but find it not, it being re-
pugnant and foreign to what we know
of the Origin of Things, revealed to
the People of God, and contained in
holy Writ. Now every Thing contra-
dictory thereto, ought not only to be
fhrewdly miftrurted, but to be abfolutely
rejected as Falfe, as well on a rational
as a religious Account ; for it muft be
allowed There is no Book fo old as the
Books of Mofes ; not even the Chinefe y
it being by themfelves recorded That
they were all burnt about two hundred
Years before Chrift, and that but a ve-
ry fmall Number of them was faved.
Our Con- The Advantage the Miffionaries thought
defavfion to h ave obtained by flattering the Chi-
towards ne fiy anc ^ letting them believe the moft
their Con- fublime Truths were in the Writings of
verjten. their own Philofophers, has not always
anfwered Expectation ; this Complaif-
ance has been more apt to fwell their

monnrous

monftrous Pride than to difpofe them to
an humble Reception of the Gofpei
Simplicity. The Athenians had at leaft
as much Senfe as the Chinefe\ we fancy
no Body can prefer the Books of Confucius
to thofe of Plato and Arijlotk ; or the
Chinefe Treatifes of Phyfic and natural Phi-
lofophy to Hippocrates j Diofcoridcs y Theo>
phrajius and feveral others 7 and yet when
St. Paul preached to them he did not of-
fer to convince them they had any Know-
ledge of God, but declared to them That
they were Strangers to him, that they
were ignorant of him ; tho' at the fame
time he might have proved to them that
their old Poets, and greaterl Philofophers
had owned a Supreme Beings much clearer
than thofe who have undertaken to de-
monftrate Thien and Xanti to mean the
fame Sovereign Entity. For the old Phi-
lofophers at leaft, and even the Bo-*
dy of the People had fome confufed I-
dea of God, which ever obtained, not-
withstanding the Cloud of Fables that in-*
terpofed : But nothing can be added to
what has already been faid upon this Subje£h
what the firft Authors of Accounts and
Hiftories of China, cited as from Books
of that Country, was implicitly believed
by many learned Men 5 for as they knew
nothing of the Tongue and Books of
the Country, they were of Courfe to rely
on thofe who had made it their particu-
lar Study ; and others who fince that

vanced. The Point w r as of immediate relati-
on to the Miffionaries, as they had taken
on them to propagate the Faith ; but the
Learned who were not fo immediately
concerned look'd upon the Thing as a
Curiofity that might help them to fome
Knowledge of thofe remote Parts* whence
Golius and VoJJtus who had frequent Dif-
courfe with Martini, while he ftaid in Hol-
land to print his Chinefe Atlas, without
any Scruple received all he told them
about China. As for Golius, he applyed
what he heard to the Improvement of Geo-
graphy and Explanation of the Cycles,
Gnaws had given us by Tranflating
the Original of Ulug Beig ; but Vojfius who
was quite fond of the Marvellous, did not
confine himfelf to what he had from Mar-
tini ; he went on farther, he laid it down
as a certain Facl:, that the Chinefe Hiftory
was much elder than the Books of Mofes y
which the Miffionaries never advanced;
on the contrary, it is what they have
endeavored to refute; tho' by very
weak Arguments, it mull be owned, while
they fuppofed the Chinefe Hiftory to be
as ancient as they gave out. Vojftus did
not trouble his Head about the Con-
fequences that might attend his AfTertion
he did not perceive what a Handle it
might be made by Free-Thinkers and
Libertins, but at once declares for the An-
tiquity of the Chinefe Eooks : But, con-
trary ta the sprnmQa Cuftom of the

pecially when he was upon fome new Para-
dox, tho' upon fuch Occafions, it is more
than ever incumbent on the Party to call up
WitnefFes. It hapned indeed he had
none to call but Martini, who in the Year
MDCL publiihed the firft Decade of his Hi-
ftory of China. This Author himfelf con-
fefles The Chimfe carry their Hiftory much
higher ; and when he allows the reft to be
fabulous, he only fpeaks for himfelf, not
for the Chinefe, who admit the whole as
equally authentic, except they have been
undeceived by the Miffionaries. Be-
fore Martini, we had fome Summary
of their Antiquities, extracted from Books
that are cited, but whofe Falfehood is
perceived at firft Sight : This fufficed
to raife an equal doubt as to the one and
the other, and no Man will ever be able
to decide the Matter without under-
Handing the Tongue, and actually peruf-
ing the Books, which was not Voflius's
Cafe. He could then only form his judg-
ment by what he was told by Fath. Mar-
tini, who never pretended That the Chi**
nefi Books were older than Mofes* On
the contrary, he has endeavored to evince
That by recurring to the Chronology of
the Septuagint we may reconcile the
Chinefe Hiftory with the Scripture, which
was the leafi of Voffius's Care. This
his Inadvertency is of fuch a Nature as
to fap the Foundations of Religion *

AN OTTOMAN TRAVELLER


SELECTIONS FROM THE

Book of Travels of Evliya Çelebi


INTRODUCTION





The Book of Travels (Seyahatname) of Evliya Çelebi occupies a unique place in the literature of travel. It is probably the longest and most ambitious travel account by any writer in any language, and a key text for all aspects of the Ottoman Empire at the time of its greatest extension in the seventeenth century. It is also the product of an unusual personality – a cultured Ottoman gentleman, pious yet unconventional, observant and inquisitive, curious about everything, obsessive about travelling, determined to leave a complete record of his travels.

Who was Evliya Çelebi?1 Born in Istanbul in 1611, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed, he was the scion of an established Turkish family with ties to the court. His father was chief goldsmith to the sultan. As a young boy he had a medrese education. In 1623, the year in which Sultan Murad IV assumed the throne, he was apprenticed to the sultan’s imam, Evliya Mehmed Efendi, who tutored him in Koran recitation. ‘I became his pupil,’ he writes, ‘and he made me his spiritual son.’ Perhaps he owed his name to his teacher and spiritual father.2 He goes on:



From Evliya Efendi I mastered the science of reciting the Koran from memory, and I could recite the entire Koran in eight hours, without addition or subtraction, and without error whether open or hidden … And every Friday eve (Thursday night) I was appointed to complete a Koran-recital. God be praised, from childhood until the present, whether at home or during my travels, I have not abandoned this practice.3





Soon he was performing Koran recitations in public, including in Aya Sofya – the great Byzantine church of Hagia Sofia that served, since the Ottoman conquest in 1453, as the chief imperial mosque. It was on one such occasion, in 1636, that he attracted the attention of Sultan Murad IV himself, who drew him into the palace. The sultan was so taken with the young man’s skills – which included singing and witty conversation as well as Koran recitation – that he made him a royal entertainer and boon companion.

Evliya writes:

God be praised that my noble father served as chief goldsmith to all the Ottoman sultans from Süleyman to Ibrahim, and that I was honoured with the companionship of such a noble sovereign and jihad warrior as Murad Khan Gazi. Just before the Baghdad campaign I received his blessings and graduated from the harem into the cavalry corps with a daily allowance of forty akçe.4





Sultan Murad IV earned the title Gazi – warrior for the faith – with his two successful campaigns against the Shi‘i (and therefore heretical) Safavids of Persia, recovering for the Ottoman Empire Revan (Erevan in Armenia) in 1635 and Baghdad in 1638.5

Despite Evliya’s claim to have graduated into the cavalry corps, he did not graduate to officer status (which would have earned him the titles Agha or Pasha). All his life he avoided official appointment, whether military or bureaucratic, which would have limited his travel options. Instead, he took advantage of inherited wealth and family and court connections in order to pursue his avocation. Free of marriage ties, renowned for his wit, his learning, and his fine voice, Evliya had no trouble attaching himself to the retinue of various pashas sent to all parts of the Empire as provincial governors, or outside the Empire as emissaries. He served them as secretary; as prayer-leader (imam) and caller-to-prayer (muezzin); as messenger and courier; and as boon companion, confidant, and raconteur. The religious offices, including Koran recitation, qualified him for the title Efendi, by which he is sometimes designated. But Çelebi – a title roughly equivalent to Gentleman or Esquire – better suited his status as courtier, musician, and littérateur.

With all his savoir-vivre and cultural refinements, Evliya nevertheless likes to portray himself as a dervish or Sufi type – a man without worldly ties, not dependent on the employment or favours of others; thus one who does not have to flatter and deceive. This personality trait, if we can take it as such, coexists with what seems to be its opposite, for we often find him flattering and seeking gain, and taking account of his personal goods. At one point an interlocutor characterises him in this fashion:

Evliya Çelebi is a wandering dervish and a world traveller. He cries the chant of every cart he mounts, and sings the praises of every man who feeds him. Wherever he rests his head, he eats and drinks and is merry.6





Even the inclination to travel is itself associated in his mind with worldly attachments as contrasting with the inclination to perform pious deeds, such as sojourning at the Prophet’s mosque in Medina.7

Wanderlust was his dominant passion – the urge, as he puts it, to be a ‘world traveller’ (seyyah-ı alem). Growing up in Istanbul, he explored all aspects of the metropolis and at the same time eagerly imbibed accounts of the far-flung conquests of Sultan Süleyman (reg. 1520–1566) and Sultan Selim II (reg. 1566–1574), as related by his father and other veterans.8 Once he ventured outside the capital, it was his father who told him to keep a journal, and even suggested the title Seyahatname or Book of Travels.9 The initiatory dream – a highly stylised narrative, in which the Prophet Muhammad blesses his intention to travel10 – sets this urge within familiar Islamic parameters: pilgrimage to the holy cities (Hajj); visitation of the tombs of saintly individuals (ziyaret); fighting for the faith (gaza).





It was the Ottoman elite – including the sultan, court officials and artisans like his father, military leaders and statesmen like his uncle Melek Ahmed Pasha, and other administrators, religious personnel (ulema) and literati, both in Istanbul and the provinces – who provided him encouragement, employment, and patronage. Whenever Evliya returned from one of his journeys, he found in one of these elite circles a forum for recounting his adventures. Thus in May, 1656, returning to Melek Pasha’s entourage in Van after eight months travel in Kurdistan, Mesopotamia and Azerbaijan:

I was not absent from our lord Melek Pasha’s company day and night for a single moment. He inquired about my travels over eight months, the great fortresses and ancient cities that I had seen, the wonders and the marvels, and the condition of every region, whether thriving or ruined, and how justice was administered. I played the part of royal companion, and we had wonderful conversations … 11





On his way back to Istanbul from travels in Özü (Ochakov) and the western Black Sea region in October 1659, he stopped in Edirne, which at that time was serving as the capital:

I resided in the houses of all the statesmen and nobles, and attended the salons during that winter season with all my patrons and lords. I regaled them with descriptions of the towns and villages I had passed through and the fortresses I had toured, and we conversed heartily, day and night.12





In 1665, while Kara Mehmed Pasha waited impatiently on the outskirts of Vienna for the Habsburg emperor’s invitation to court, Evliya went off touring the city and in the evening reported back what he had witnessed. He wheedled a passport out of the young emperor himself (Leopold I) after impressing him with his knowledge of the Christian holy places in Jerusalem. And following his second (largely fictional) trip to Western Europe he again regaled listeners when he set foot on Ottoman territory.13

Two years later Evliya’s audience was the Sultan himself. Sultan Mehmed IV made his court in Edirne in order to indulge his passion for the hunt and also to avoid the plague raging in Istanbul. In May of 1667, when Evliya returned from the Crimea and the Caucasus, he first stopped at Edirne to report to the Sultan’s deputy and promised to bring him the falcons he had captured in Circassia in order to present them to the Sultan. He then went home to Istanbul where, he reports, six of his slaves died of the plague in a single week. Setting out toward Crete in late December, he again stopped at Edirne, delivered the falcons, and this time had a direct interview with the Sultan.14

At the end of his road in 1672 Evliya found a patron in the governor of Egypt, Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha, who even provided him an apartment in the Cairo citadel where he resided, so he tells us, for seven years. Aside from Ibrahim Pasha, whom he explicitly names as his patron, Evliya provides long lists of religious personnel in Cairo during that period and of ‘beys and notables who are my benefactors and to whom I owe a debt of obligation.’ They are, almost exclusively, members of the Turkish ruling elite. The first to be named in the second list is Özbek Bey, Emir of the Hajj for Egypt in the 1670s, with whom Evliya had struck up a friendship during the pilgrimage journey. Pierre MacKay may be right in speculating that the autograph manuscript of the Book of Travels, of which volumes 1–8 have come down to us, was in Özbek Bey’s private collection from the time of Evliya’s death around 1684 until it was brought to Istanbul in 1742.15 In any event, it is clear that Evliya had no lack of patrons and supporters during the time that he was completing the final redaction of his work.

* * *



The Book of Travels encompasses much of what was considered in Evliya’s day the Ottoman realm, which comprised a multitude of peoples – Christians, Jews, and Muslims; Armenians, Greeks, Serbs, Hungarians, Arabs, Kurds, and Turks – and whose sway extended over the traditional seven climes, from the first – Dongala at the equator – to the seventh – the Volga River. Evliya ventured north to Azov in the Crimea, south to Ibrim in Lower Nubia; he visited Baghdad on the eastern frontier, Stolnibelgrad on the western frontier. But his ambition as a traveller was not limited to the Ottoman realm. North of Azov, he spent some time in the land of the Kalmyks; southward from Ibrim, he travelled to the Funj kingdom in the Sudan. He went on two official missions to Persia, in the wake of the Ottoman-Safavid truce of 1639; and he joined an Ottoman embassy to the Habsburg court in Vienna. His travels beyond the borderlands of the Empire paralleled Ottoman efforts to secure their strategic and territorial interests. Evliya also participated in a number of military campaigns, most notably the battle on the Raab River (Battle of Saint Gotthard) in 1664 and the Candia campaign that resulted in the final Ottoman conquest of Crete in 1669.

What kind of traveller was he? For Evliya, travel was not a diversion but an obsession. He had to see everything, and he had to record everything he saw. He was nothing if not systematic. The town descriptions – the most characteristic literary unit of the Book of Travels – generally follow the same pattern, with subheadings introduced in elaborate Persianate phraseology. Sometimes the headings are all we have, followed by a blank space where he provides no information. It looks as though he had a checklist drawn up and for each town he simply went through and filled out the list. Sometimes he is at pains to explain why he cut his description short. For example, he apologises for not counting the shops in Sidirkapsi, in northern Greece, saying that he was too depressed because of the loss of his runaway slaveboy.16

For one whose primary identity was ‘traveller’ Evliya had a strange distaste for sea travel. He soured early in his travel career when he suffered shipwreck during a storm on the Black Sea – an episode he describes with great pathos.17 Returning home after a long recuperation, he vowed never again to venture by boat onto the Black Sea – a vow he seems to have kept, despite subsequent journeys around its littoral.18 Mentioning a trip on the Caspian in 1666, he says that he has always had an aversion to sea travel, and that this was the main reason he did not go either to the Maghreb or to India.19Of course, he did go to Crete and other islands off the Turkish coast, including Cos and Rhodes. But when he boarded a frigate heading to Cyprus in 1671, it was attacked by enemy galleons and had to return to port; Evliya disembarked, consoling himself that he had seen enough of Cyprus when he went there in 1650 – a journey mentioned nowhere else!20

Evliya rarely travelled alone. Even when not leading an official delegation, or attached to an Ottoman governor or commander, he was generally accompanied by friends, a suite of servants and hangers-on, often a bodyguard when the roads were unsafe; not to speak of horses, for which he had a special fondness, and even at times dogs. For example, setting off in 1671 from Istanbul – for the last time, as it turned out – intending to go on pilgrimage, he had in his train three travel-companions, eight slaveboys, and fifteen Arab horses.21 More than once, his itinerary was interrupted by the need to pursue a runaway slave.22

Travelling in the Sudan in 1672, Evliya encountered two Bektashi dervishes, one riding a rhinoceros and one an oryx. They joined his party and accompanied him all the way to Suakin on the Red Sea coast. When the rhinoceros died and the oryx ran away, Evliya provided camels as substitute mounts.23 Some of this, if not all, is surely fictional. But he did like having travel companions. At one point, in Dagestan in 1666, he even lists the names of five of them – all dervishes of one stripe or another!24

Evliya frequently expresses the notion that a traveller must conform to the ways of the country he is in. Thus, in the Sudan in 1672, he complains of his host’s stinginess but remarks: ‘I was in a foreign land, so I bowed to necessity.’ He was unaffected by the heat in the Sudan, and says that he conformed his dress to the climate.25 The cold was more difficult for travelling, which is perhaps why he eventually settled in Egypt. Azov is a proverbial hell because of the cold, he tells us, just as Damascus is a proverbial paradise because of the pleasant climate. In January 1667 while he was in Azov he slipped on the marble floor of a bath that was icy; and after returning to Istanbul he suffered pains and discharges in his eyes for two months, symptoms (of glaucoma?) that he attributed to the cold weather he had just endured.26 He occasionally complains of fever and other ailments, but in general had a strong constitution.

What were the circumstances under which he undertook his journeys? The Ottoman Empire fell heir to a system of road networks and sea-lanes going back at least to Roman times. These networks were maintained for official uses: military – the transport of armies, garrison troops, and supplies; bureaucratic – raising taxes that were forwarded to the capital, issuing orders from the capital to the provinces, and circulating state agents and their retinues;27 and religious – the annual Hajj pilgrimage and dispersal of state monies to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Just as important were the private uses of these networks: commercial – the transport of merchant caravans28 and the attendance at periodic markets and fairs; religious – the visitation of shrines, the search for religious knowledge or for spiritual guidance, and the attendance at annual festivals and birthday celebrations of the great Sufi leaders; and touristic – seeking out natural and man-made wonders, enjoying pleasure parks, summer pastures, and hunting grounds, glorying in the achievements of present and bygone civilisations.

Evliya participated in all of these activities. What made him distinctive as a traveller was the systematic nature in which he conducted his journeys and recorded them.

We must imagine a typical travel party of ten or twenty individuals, consisting of the traveller (merchant, scholar, government agent, or tourist) and his associates, his servants or slaves, and their mounts – generally horses, but also donkeys, mules or camels as pack animals. In many cases this travel party was accompanied by an armed guard. In any case, it had to be strong enough to counter bandits and wealthy enough to purchase supplies along the way. For Evliya the scholar and writer, it had to accommodate his books and his writing equipment.

It is clear that Evliya kept systematic notes en route, and that during the periods he was home – first in Istanbul, then in Cairo – he organised the notes into a coherent narrative, the Book of Travels. What were his aims in writing this huge book, and how did he compose it? An analysis of the ten volumes29 shows that throughout the work there is a clash between two organising principles: on the one hand, spatial or geographical; on the other hand, temporal or chronological.

Evliya’s first aim was to provide a complete description of the Ottoman Empire and its hinterlands. In pursuing this aim, the spatial or topographical survey is the favourite mode. These town descriptions generally follow the same pattern, beginning with the history and administrative organisation of the town, its names in various languages and their etymologies, and its geographic position; continuing with a description of the town’s topography, with particular attention to fortifications; including descriptions of houses, mosques, medreses, primary schools, hans, baths, and fountains; town quarters and religious affiliations; climate; the appearance, dress, manners and customs of the populace; proper names and speech habits; the ulema, poets, physicians, and other notables; markets, shops, products, and comestibles; and parks, gardens, and picnic spots; and concluding with graves and shrines, along with biographies or hagiographies of the dead.30 His second aim was to provide a complete record of his travels. In pursuing this aim, the first-person account of his itineraries and adventures comes to the fore.

The first mode is imperial in scope, having sources in the ‘Roads and Kingdoms’ (Arabic: masalik wa mamalik) tradition of Muslim geographers.31 Evliya’s human geography embraces history, customs, folklore, and much else; but all tends to fit into pre-established formulas and grids. The second mode is personal or autobiographical, with sources in the rihla tradition of Muslim travellers, the best known of whom is Ibn Battuta (fourteenth century), whose life and travels overlapped with those of Marco Polo.32 Evliya’s junkets and adventures follow recognisable narrative patterns and tend to be quirky and anecdotal, sometimes sliding into satire or fantasy. At certain points Evliya adopts a different kind of chronological ordering, viz. according to historical sequence, based on the ta’rikh tradition of the Muslim annalists.

Evliya belonged to a group of educated men at the time who had a keen interest in geography. The scholar Katib Çelebi, at his death in 1657, left unfinished the first major Ottoman work on world geography. His ‘Cosmorama’ (Cihannüma) incorporated the writings of Arab geographers, the itineraries of Ottoman military campaigns, and European cartographic works such as the Atlas Minor of Gerhard Mercator.33 Evliya was familiar with some of those sources and consulted them before composing his own account. Yet what makes the Book of Travels distinct from the ‘Cosmorama,’ or other comparable works, is the mixture of the factual and the personal. Indeed, as Cemal Kafadar has observed, the Book of Travels is the most monumental example of first person narratives in Ottoman literature.34 The generic novelty of the Book of Travels perhaps explains its relative neglect among Ottoman literati until the middle of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, parts of the Book of Travels parallel another kind of travel writing that now appears – the ambassadorial report (sefaretname). One of the earliest was written by Kara Mehmed Pasha about the embassy to Vienna in 1665.35

The Book of Travels, with its first-person narrative and focus on human geography, is also reminiscent of another tradition of travel writing altogether – the Chinese ‘lyric travel account’ (yu-chi). In these accounts, the travel itineraries were primarily domestic and, compared with early modern European travel writing, there is little evidence of ‘the idea of self-fashioning, both of the individual traveller and of the collectivity of home society.’36 This is also the case with the Book of Travels. And when Evliya did venture into the realm of the ‘other’ we do not get the impression that any of the encounters was transformative. Evliya usually felt out of his element beyond the Ottoman borders, and seemed most at home among the Tatars, who were partially Ottomanised.

* * *



The trajectory of Evliya’s travels – of his life – follows a path between the two great metropolises of the Empire: Istanbul, his birthplace and home town; and Cairo, where he lived his last ten years and where he drew up the final redaction of his magnum opus. Thus, Volumes 1 and 10 are devoted to these two cities. Evliya’s description of Istanbul is without question the best guidebook to that city ever written. If Evliya had left us nothing but chapter 270 of Volume 1 – the panorama of the Istanbul craftsmen and merchants parading before the sultan – he would still enjoy a reputation as one of the greatest Ottoman writers. His description of Cairo in Volume 10 is equally impressive, the most elaborate and complete survey of that city written between the two Khitats, that of al-Maqrizi in the fifteenth century and that of Ali Mubarak in the nineteenth.

These two volumes, while serving as the frame for the larger work, appear to be modelled on each other in various respects. For example, the description of the shops and guilds in Cairo (Volume 10, chapter 49) is a reduced and more straightforward version of the corresponding sections in Istanbul (Volume 1, chapter 270). And the survey of quarters and villages up and down the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus (Volume 1, chapters 235–66) has its analogue in Evliya’s trips up and down the Nile (Volume 10, chapters 65–74), although in the latter case these are tied in with the chronologies and itineraries of the work as a whole.

Only Volumes 1 and 10 have the chapter organisation. What about Volumes 2–9? While these do not have the same tight structure as the frame volumes, there is clear evidence that Evliya intended to provide a kind of shape to each volume. The dividing points are not haphazard, although all ten volumes are roughly the same size. Volume 2 begins with a reprisal of the dream, described much more elaborately at the beginning of Volume 1. This is a clear indication that Evliya conceived of the Book of Travels as a single text, since his journeys, and his account of them, all have a common motivation and share common goals. These goals include the traditional triad of seyahat (‘travel’, i.e., tourism, satisfying curiosity), ticaret (‘commerce’, i.e., making one’s fortune), and ziyaret (‘pilgrimage’, i.e., fulfilling religious obligation).37 But they also include such things as serving the Ottoman state; eulogising patrons and associates; and providing his contemporaries – and later generations – with instruction and amusement. It is suggestive that Evliya’s first foray outside of Istanbul is the old Ottoman capital of Bursa; and that his last journey before settling in Cairo is the pilgrimage to Mecca, of which his account provides a vade mecum. When he sets out on the Hajj at the beginning of Volume 9, again from Istanbul, he has another (much shorter) dream in which his long-dead father and his old teacher Evliya Efendi both appear and urge him to go.38 Compositionally, this dream parallels the reprisal of the initiatory dream at the beginning of Volume 2.

Although his itineraries over forty years repeat and crisscross, his accounts of them tend to be coherent and interrelated. Broadly speaking Volume 2 can be characterised by the rubric ‘Anatolia’, Volume 4 by ‘Safavid Borderlands’, Volume 6 by ‘Hungary’, Volume 7 by ‘Habsburg Borderlands’, Volume 8 by ‘Greece’, and Volume 9 by ‘Pilgrimage’.

Evliya’s account naturally begins with the capital, also his birthplace, Istanbul, to which he devotes an entire volume. The historical and geographical surveys of the metropolis proceed systematically, although with frequent digressions and anecdotal asides. Volume 2 opens with Evliya’s early journeys outside Istanbul, first to the old Ottoman capital of Bursa, then along the Black Sea coast as far as the Caucasus region, the homeland of his mother’s kin, and around to the Crimea. He participates in raids against the infidel. He suffers shipwreck. Returning to Erzurum in the train of the newly appointed governor of that province, his kinsman Defterdarzade Mehmed Pasha, he accompanies an envoy to Tabriz in the country of the heretical Kızılbaş (i.e., the Safavids of Persia), his first venture outside the Ottoman realm. Later Mehmed Pasha is caught up in one of the frequent Anatolian disturbances of that era, a revolt by a disaffected provincial governor or ‘Celali’. Learning of his father’s death, Evliya returns to the capital in time to witness the deposition of the extravagant Sultan Ibrahim and the accession of the seven-year-old Sultan Mehmed IV (1648).



In Volume 3 Evliya accompanies the newly appointed governor of Syria, Murtaza Pasha, to Damascus. Luckily he is back in the capital when his kinsman Melek Ahmed Pasha is appointed grand vizier (1650). From that time on he is almost constantly in Melek’s service, following him to Özü, Silistre, and Sofia, and back to Istanbul where the pasha serves as deputy grand vizier until the arrival of Ipşir Pasha from Aleppo. Ipşir ‘exiles’ Melek to Van. After reaching Van, in Volume 4, Evliya once again goes on an embassy to Persia, and takes the opportunity to travel to Baghdad and make an extensive tour of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, returning to Van only at the beginning of Volume 5. The remainder of Volume 5 covers the latter part of Melek’s career, as governor of Özü and Bosnia, interrupted by the blow caused by the death of his beloved wife, Kaya Sultan. At the beginning of Volume 6 Melek is recalled from the Transylvania campaign to marry another sultana, Fatma Sultan, the daughter of his original patron, Sultan Ahmed I. The unhappy match is short-lived, ended by Melek’s death in 1662.39 Though left patronless, Evliya rejoices in the lack of family attachments and goes off to join the German campaign. The remainder of Volume 6 includes a detailed description of Hungary.

Volume 7 includes eyewitness accounts of the Battle of St Gotthard (1664) and the Ottoman embassy to Vienna under Kara Mehmed Pasha (1665), followed by travels in the Crimea, Circassia, and Kalmykia. Volume 8 is largely devoted to Greece, including an eyewitness account of the Candia campaign and the final Ottoman conquest of Crete (1669). Pilgrimage to the holy cities of Jerusalem, Mecca, and Medina is the subject of Volume 9. In 1672 Evliya finally reaches Egypt, his goal and haven after forty years of travel; and his leisurely description of Cairo in Volume 10 (plus journeys up and down the Nile) recalls his description of Istanbul. In the second half of Volume 10 he engages in expeditions and safaris in the Sudan and Ethiopia, finally returning to Cairo to write up his memoirs. The last date mentioned corresponds to 1683. Evliya probably died in that year or shortly thereafter.

His autograph manuscript – of which eight of the ten volumes have come down to us – apparently languished unread until 1742 when it was brought to Istanbul and copied.40 Modern scholarship begins with Joseph von Hammer [-Purgstall] who hit upon a manuscript of the first four volumes as early as 1804. Hammer thought that these comprised the entire Book of Travels. He began to publish excerpts and translations (in German) in 1814. These efforts culminated in an English translation of Volumes 1 and 2.41 Hammer’s translation – though hastily done, abbreviated, and faulty in detail – captured the spirit of the original, and has served to make Evliya known to the English-speaking world.42

Meanwhile, an imprint of the complete Turkish text appeared between 1896 and 1938.43 The first six volumes suffered from bowdlerisations, rewritings, errors, omissions, and censorings. Volumes 7–10 were much better, though still falling short of a critical edition. It was not until the 1970s that Richard Kreutel and Pierre MacKay showed the way.44 A new edition, based on the autograph manuscript and a critical evaluation of other manuscripts, appeared between 1999 and 2007.45 There is also a ‘corpus of partial editions’ with English or German translations.46

Aside from several translations into modern Turkish, substantial portions of the Book of Travels have been rendered into Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Hungarian, Romanian, Russian and Serbian. These portions were chosen based on national and geographical criteria – thus the sections on Greece were translated into Greek, the sections covered by the Soviet Union into Russian, etc. Especially noteworthy is Richard Kreutel’s German translation of the Vienna section from Volume 7.47 An attempt to break the mold is Faruk Bilici’s French translation of three battle accounts.48 Most recently, Hasan Javadi and Willem Floor have published their translation of Evliya’s travels in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus region.49

The choice of texts for the present anthology was governed by several criteria. We wished to have samples from all ten volumes, and to have examples of the various descriptive and narrative types – the city monograph or town description; the itinerary; descriptions of mosques, churches, and other monuments; language specimens; descriptions of natural phenomena such as oil wells (Volume 2, selection 8) and manufacturing processes such as iron works (Volume 6, selection 3); descriptions of processions, festivals, and entertainments; narratives of battle and the hunt; dreams; pilgrimage accounts; and personal adventures, such as narrow escapes and encounters with bandits.

While most of the translations are new, we have made use of some published elsewhere. For Volumes 1 and 2 we have occasionally borrowed Hammer’s phraseology. The Diyarbekir and Bitlis selections in Volumes 4 and 5 and the Albania selections in Volumes 6 and 8 are based on materials in the ‘corpus of partial editions’ mentioned above. Some shorter selections are borrowed from An Ottoman Mentality and other books and articles by Robert Dankoff. For the Vienna section in Volume 7 we profited from Kreutel’s German translation and also made use of Livingston’s version of the surgical operations.50 For Dubrovnik (Volume 6, selection 5) we consulted the translations of Turková and Rocchi;51 for Cairo and the Funj kingdom (Volume 10), those of Prokosch;52 for the pyramids, that of Haarmann. 53 Some parts of the Athens section in Volume 8 employ earlier translations by MacKay.54 And for the sections on Safed and Jerusalem in Volumes 3 and 9 we made use of Stephan’s versions from the 1930s.55 In all cases, we made revisions and corrections based on the original Ottoman Turkish text, and other changes for the sake of readability and stylistic uniformity.

Evliya Çelebi is not an easy author to translate. He wields a vocabulary greater than any other Turkish writer.56 His own style tends to prolixity and exuberance and abounds in word play. He swings between the factual and the fanciful. He is sometimes exhaustively detailed to the point of tedium, sometimes vivacious and sparkling with wit. We have tried to convey his meaning accurately and, occasionally, to suggest his stylistic virtuosity. Where uncertainties remain, we have signalled this by a question mark (?).

The selections from each of the ten volumes are preceded by brief introductions. An appendix provides an outline of the entire work. It lists all the chapter headings for Volumes 1 and 10, and gives a rough outline of the untranslated portions for Volumes 2–9. It shows where all the translated selections fit and indicates the folios of the original manuscripts that have been translated.

Koranic citations are given in the Dawood translation,57 sometimes adjusted to fit the context. These and other quotes in Arabic and Persian are given in italics. Bold in the main text corresponds to overlining or orthographical prominence in the manuscript, mainly used for headings. Rounded brackets { } enclose Evliya’s own marginal notes, added when he was revising the text. Blanks left in the original text the size of a single word are indicated by (—). The large number of such blanks is characteristic of Evliya’s descriptive style, which strives for exactness. Rhetorically, the blank means, ‘To be filled in when more information is available’. Lines left blank are also indicated. Otherwise parentheses enclose explanatory notes supplied by the translators.

Evliya invariably refers to Istanbul as Islambol, meaning ‘Islam-plenty’. In the translation, the city’s name is rendered as Istanbul. Frequently he calls it Kostantiniyye, rendered here as Constantinople. The term Rum at this period usually referred to Asia Minor or the core Ottoman lands extending into Thrace; we have usually rendered it as Turkey or left it as Rum. A common designation for Christian Europe is Kafiristan meaning ‘Land of the Infidels’ (the coinage Infidelia suggests itself as an equivalent); we have consistently rendered it as Christendom. On the other hand, we have let Frengistan – meaning land of the Franks, i.e., Western Europe – remain in the translation. When he refers to himself, Evliya generally uses the locution bu hakir which we translate as ‘this humble one’ or, more often, simply ‘I’ or ‘me’.

As a general rule, we have rendered Turkish personal names and place names in modern Turkish orthography, Arabic and Persian ones in a transcription compatible with that of the Encyclopedia of Islam. Thus Turks will have names such as Mehmed, Ömer, Osman, Hüseyn as opposed to Muhammad, Umar, Uthman, Husayn. Note that in the Turkish orthography, c is pronounced as English j, ç as ch, ş as sh, j as s in measure. This orthography is also used for the specimens of various languages.



1 Practically everything that we know about Evliya must be derived from the Book of Travels, since no other Ottoman source has yet turned up that mentions him. Only a list of the retinue in Kara Mehmed Pasha’s 1665 embassy, discovered in the Vienna court archive, includes an ‘Evlia Efendi’, which must be Evliya Çelebi (published in Teply 1975; also in Kreutel 1957 2nd ed. 1987, 17). Recently Pinelopi Stathi turned up the draft of a Greek patriarchal letter, of uncertain date, recommending Evliya as ‘a man of honour, and peace. He has the desire and the inclination to be a traveller of the world, and describe places, cities and nations of men, having no harm in his heart to make injustice or hurt anyone’ (Stathi 2005/ 2006, 267; and see MacKay 2007). This is similar to the ‘patents’ or safe-conducts that Evliya mentions several times (e.g., see Volume 7, selection 6; Volume 9, selection 10). Also, five actual graffiti have been preserved. Four of these have been known for a long time; see Prokosch 1988–89 for photographs, hand-drawn copies, transcriptions and translations. A fifth has been reported by Mehmet Tütüncü. See Dankoff 2004, 149–50 for comparison with the thirty or so graffiti that Evliya records in the Book of Travels. In addition, a map of the Nile in the Vatican library can be attributed to Evliya; it was made known in Rossi 1949; an edition is being prepared by Nuran Tezcan and Robert Dankoff.

2 Evliya, which designates the ‘friends’ (Arabic: awliya) of God who, according to Koran 10:62, ‘have nothing to fear or to regret.’ Evliya is also the term for saintly individuals whose tombs are the objects of pilgrimage and visitation (ziyaret). The usual translation in this anthology is ‘saints’.

5 The Revan and Baghdad Pavilions, added to the Topkapı Palace, may be considered Murad IV’s counterpart to the great imperial mosques of earlier gazi sultans – Fatih (Mehmed II), Süleyman, and Sultan Ahmed. These pavilions were later used as libraries, the Baghdad pavilion eventually housing the autograph ms. of the Book of Travels, which accounts for the designations in the bibliography. (Only Volume 6 got separated from Volume 5 and ended up in the Revan Pavilion instead.)

LITERARY ALLUSIONS





A notable feature of Evliya’s literary style is the plethora of references to Islamic and Persian lore. He could assume that his audience – the Ottoman elite – would instantly recognise allusions to Koran and Hadith, and to such Persian classics as Firdawsi’s Book of Kings (Shahnama, completed in 1010) and Sa‘di’s Rose Garden (Gulistan, completed in 1258).

Especially the legendary Persian kings and heroes served as templates; the mere mention of their names was enough to lend a rich associative gloss to whatever is under discussion. Thus Jamshid, an early king and culture hero, stands in for majesty and inventiveness; Kay Kavus for fine cuisine; Farhad for mining and engineering. Chosroes (Khusraw) is famous for his monumental vault, which still stood near Baghdad; while his beloved Shirin is associated with fine royal structures. The tyrant Zahhak stands in for a grim executioner, hence ‘sword of Zahhak’.

A mountain suggests Mt Qaf which, in the traditional geography, surrounds the inhabited world; or else Bisutun, a lofty range in Iran. A strong fortress or dam elicits a comparison to the Wall of Iskandar, referring to the rampart against Gog and Magog constructed by Alexander the Great, who was identified with Dhu’l-qarnayn – ‘The Two-Horned’ – mentioned in the Koran (18:83). Or a mighty fortress is likened to that of Qahqaha (near Alamut in Iran); while a glorious palace is likened to Khawarnaq (near Najaf in Iraq). A fountain may evoke that of Salsabil, mentioned in the Koran (76:18), and a river that of Kawthar (108:1); while a beautiful garden invariably recalls that of the many-columned city of Iram (89:7). In Muslim lore, this last was built by Shaddad ibn Ad, who for Evliya serves as another example both of a great builder and a tyrant.

Mani – the founder of the Manichaean religion, but remembered for the artistry with which he adorned his book of revelation, the Arzhang – is often conjured up in connection with painting or any fine handiwork. (Evliya apparently thought that Arzhang was the name of another painter.) The other figure invariably mentioned in this connection is Bihzad, the famous master of the Persian miniature, who lived in Herat in the fifteenth century. Evliya also mentions more recent Persian masters such as Shah Quli, Vali Jan and Agha Riza. When it comes to calligraphy, first place goes to the Persian Yaqut Musta‘simi (d. 1298); then the Turks take the palm with Karahisari (d. 1556) and Sheikh Hamdullah (d. 1519); and also the master of paper cutouts, Fahri Çelebi of Bursa (d. 1611?).1 Musical performances, on the other hand, invariably recall those of Sultan-Husayn Bayqara, who presided over the Timurid court of Herat in the late 15th century.

There are frequent allusions to pre-Islamic sacred history, from Adam to Jesus. A seductress is dubbed Zulaykha, referring to the figure known as Potiphar’s wife in the Old Testament who tried to seduce Joseph. (In the Koran she is simply called ‘His master’s wife’ – 12:23.) The Biblical Korah (Qarun in the Koran, 28:76) is proverbial for great wealth. Also in the Koran he is joined with Haman and Pharoah as figures of tyranny (29:39, 40:24), and Evliya follows suit, sometimes adding the Umayyad caliphs Marwan and Yazid to the list. Loqman, on the other hand, is proverbial for wisdom (31:12).

Hızır (Arabic: al-Khidr) is associated with the Water of Life that bestows immortality; and he comes to the rescue of those in distress, especially seamen. These traits are based on interpretations of the Koranic figure identified simply as ‘one of Our servants’ (18:65) who guided both Moses and Dhu’l-qarnayn/Iskandar. David – both a king and a prophet – is patron saint of ironsmiths stemming from his association with ‘the armourer’s craft’ in the Koran (21:80). Someone sleeps like the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, referred to in the Koran as Sleepers of the Cave (18:9).

Other allusions are to figures or events in Islamic history. Any cave – or something that just resembles a cave – calls up the Cave of Orphans, which probably refers to the cave near Mecca where the Prophet Muhammad and his companion Abu Bakr took refuge from their enemies. Salman – known as the Pure (Pak) or the Persian (al-Farisi) – was a Companion of the Prophet who became the patron saint of barbers and was thought to have a role in the initiation of various craft guilds. Bilal the Ethiopian was the Prophet’s muezzin, and so the patron saint of Evliya himself in that role. Hassan ibn Thabit, known as the Prophet’s poet, serves as a figure for poetic skill. Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas, a leading Companion of the Prophet and commander of the Arab armies during the conquest of Iraq, was the patron saint of archers; Amr Ayyar al-Zamiri, the Prophet’s messenger, of runners and tumblers. A certain Mahmud Piryar Veli was the patron saint of wrestlers, Kassab Cömerd that of butchers.

Ma‘di-karib, associated with the semi-legendary exploits of the Prophet’s uncle Hamza, was proverbial for his large appetite; while Ma‘noghlu, a Druze rebel in Mt Lebanon whom the Ottomans executed in 1635, was proverbial for his imprisonment. Abu Muslim, leader of the Abbasid cause in the eighth century, was known as a halberdier and so his name gets associated with hatchets. The ascetic and saintly Rabi‘a al-Adawiya (d. 801) was a model of chastity. The philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (d. 1037) had a reputation as a great physician, but also as a great magician. And an elephant can be qualified as Mahmudi, named for Mahmud of Ghazna (reg. 998–1030) who famously used elephants in his military exploits.

Sunnis as well as Shi‘is recalled the trials of Husayn and his followers, who were martyred at Karbala in Iraq in the year 680; and so the Plain of Karbala is a figure for all who suffer thirst or are wounded in battle. The villain of the Karbala drama was the Umayyad caliph Yazid, whose name is enshrined in the pejorative term Yazidi for a certain heretical group.

VOLUME ONE





Istanbul





EVLIYA BEGINS THE Book of Travels with a volume devoted to Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and his birthplace. The volume opens with an account of the dream he has on his twentieth birthday, 19 August 1630, in which the Prophet Muhammad blesses his desire to travel. It proceeds with a historical and geographical survey of Istanbul, including its suburbs along the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus.

The opening volume of the Book of Travels is like a guidebook to Istanbul as well as a tribute, offering a vast panorama of life in the city, with descriptions of buildings, monuments and gardens, dress and cuisine, types of occupations and social groups. It also provides a template for Evliya’s narrative and descriptive styles, which aim both to instruct and amuse. And as the centre of his world, Istanbul would become the touchstone and measure of everything he witnessed during his travels.

We have included here Evliya’s description of one of the great imperial mosques of the city; also the churches and taverns of Galata; and the pleasure park of Kağıthane.

The systematic nature of Evliya’s account is reflected in the chapter divisions – a feature found only in this and in the final volume. By far the longest is chapter 270, comprising the 47 guilds of Istanbul craftsmen and merchants parading before the sultan. The excerpts included here (furriers, circumcision barbers, tightrope walkers) give the flavour of these sections that are such rich sources for Ottoman life.





1. Introduction: The dream





In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful, and to Him we turn for help.

Praise be to God who has ennobled those honoured with worship and travel, and has vouchsafed for me the path to the holy places and shrines. May blessings be upon him, who laid the foundations of the fortresses of Sharia (the sacred law of Islam), and established them on the basis of prophethood and tariqa (the mystical path of Sufism), and upon his good and pure family. And may abundant blessings and the most excellent salutations be upon him, the protector endowed with exceptional character, the most noble and perfect of creation, the model for prayer who said, ‘Pray as you saw me,’ the infallible guide, Muhammad, who spoke Arabic best. In his honour, God, the Lord of the Realms and Creator of the Heavens, made the earth a pleasant home for the sons of Adam and made them the most noble of all the creatures:

Blessed be God, who ordered all affairs by His will,



Without oppression, and without injustice!





May blessings be upon the shadow of God on earth and good order of terrestrial things, sultan and son of the sultan, Sultan Gazi Murad Khan IV, son of Sultan Ahmed Khan, son of Sultan Mehmed Khan (III), son of Sultan Murad Khan III, son of Sultan Selim Khan II, son of Sultan Süleyman Khan, son of Selim Khan I, son of Bayezid Khan II, son of Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror. May God’s mercy be upon them all.

May God’s mercy be especially upon Sultan Murad (IV), the gazi khan, may his earth be sweet, the Padishah majestic as Jamshid, the conqueror of Baghdad, with whose service I was honoured when I began these jottings. It was in the year 1041 (1631), in the time of his reign, that while making tours and pleasure outings to the villages and towns and thousands of parks and Iram-like rose gardens around the pleasant land (belde-i tayyibe, cf. Koran 34:15), i.e. Constantinople, the desire to make extensive travels came to mind.

I beseeched the Creator at every moment to grant me health of body, complete journey, and faith to the last breath, asking myself, ‘How can I get free of the pressures of father and mother, teacher and brother, and become a world traveller?’ I was always on good terms with heart-wounded dervishes and glad to converse with them. And when I heard a description of the seven climes and the four corners of the earth, I longed to travel with all my heart and soul. So I became utterly wretched, a vagabond crying out, ‘Might I roam the world? Might it be vouchsafed to me to reach the Holy Land, Cairo and Damascus, Mecca and Medina, and to rub my face at the Sacred Garden, the tomb of the Prophet, glory of the universe?’

By God’s wisdom – Reason for travelling and roaming the land – this humble one and poor supplicant full of fault – world traveller and boon companion of mankind, Evliya the unhypocritical, son of Dervish Mehmed Zılli – always desired God’s guidance in dreams while praising Him abundantly, and sought His succour for a sick heart while reciting Koranic chapters and verses. So I lay down on the pillow of lamentation, in the corner of my hovel, in my birthplace Istanbul, to a sleep of wish fulfilment. It was the night of Ashura in the month of Muharram, the year 1040 (10 August 1630), in a state twixt sleep and wake, that I had a dream.

This humble one saw myself in the Ahi Çelebi mosque, near the Yemiş landing – a mosque built with money lawfully acquired, an ancient mosque where prayers are accepted by God. There were soldiers bearing arms. The door was opened and the light-filled mosque was crowded with a luminous congregation, who were busy performing the dawn prayer. It seems that I stood motionless at the foot of the pulpit and gazed in astonishment at this congregation with their beaming faces.

‘Good sir,’ said I, turning to the person beside me, ‘please tell me who you are, and what your noble name is?’

‘I am one of the Ten Promised Paradise, the patron saint of archers, Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas,’ he replied. I kissed his hand and said, ‘And who, good sir, are the lovely congregation immersed in light on this right side?’

‘They are the spirits of the prophets. In the row behind them are the spirits of the saints and the pure ones. And these are the spirits of the Companions of the Prophet, the Emigrants (from Mecca), the Helpers (in Medina), the People of the Bench (Arbab-ı Suffa – a group of pietists during the lifetime of the Prophet), the martyrs of Karbala, and the Friends. Those to the right of the prayer niche are Abu Bakr and Umar; those to the left, Uthman and Ali. The man in front of the prayer-niche wearing a cap is Uways al-Qarani, the Prophet’s brother in this world and the next. The dark-skinned man at the left wall of the mosque is Bilal the Ethiopian, your patron saint and the caller to prayer of the Prophet. The short-statured man who groups the congregation into rows is Amr Ayyar al-Zamiri. These soldiers marching with the standard, whose garments are dyed red with blood, are Hamza and all the spirits of the martyrs.’

Thus he pointed out to me the entire congregation, one by one. As I gazed at each in turn, I held my hand to my breast, nodding in acquaintance, and I found my soul refreshed.

‘Good sir,’ I asked, ‘what is the reason of this congregation’s gathering in this mosque?’

‘The fleet-footed Tatar soldiery, among the Muslim forces in the vicinity of Azov, have come here to Istanbul which is under the protection of the Prophet. Later we will go to help the Crimean Khan. Now the Prophet is coming to perform the morning prayer. With him are Hasan and Husayn and the rest of the Twelve Imams, and the rest of the Ten who were Promised Paradise. He will signal you to begin the call to prayer. So cry out loud, God is great. After the salutations, recite the Throne Verse (2:255). Bilal will repeat, Glory be to God, and you, Praise be to God. Bilal will repeat, God is great, and you, Amen, Amen. The entire congregation will join in to profess His unity. Then after you say, And blessings upon all the prophets and messengers, and praise be to God, Lord of the Universe, rise immediately and kiss the Prophet’s hand while he is sitting in the prayer niche. Say, Intercession, O Messenger of God, and make an appeal.’

Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas gave all these instructions while sitting at my side. What should I see next?

A clear light broke through the door of the mosque. While the inside had already been filled with light, it was now light upon light (24:35). All the noble Companions and the spirits of the prophets and the saints rose to their feet and stood ready. The Prophet appeared felicitously at the foot of his green standard, with face veiled, staff in hand and sword girded at his waist. Hasan stood on his right and Husayn on his left. He placed his right foot inside the light-filled mosque, uttering, In the name of God. Then he removed the veil from his face and said, Peace be with you, my community. The entire congregation replied, And with you be peace, messenger of God, lord of the religious communities.

The Prophet at once advanced towards the prayer-niche and performed the two prostrations of the dawn prayer. This humble one was overcome with fright and my body trembled, yet I was able to observe all of his features. They were just as described in the Hilye of Hakani (on the Prophet’s physiognomy, completed 1599). His veil was of crimson Kashmir cloth. His turban was a white Arab-style turban with twelve bands. His mantle was of camel hair, yellowish in colour. On his neck was a yellow woolen shawl. On his feet were yellow boots. And a toothpick had been stuck in his turban.

After the salutation, the Prophet looked upon this humble one, struck his right hand on his knee, and commanded me to begin the call. I started immediately, according to Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas’s instructions, by intoning in the segah musical mode, May God bless our lord Muhammad and his family and grant them peace, and completed the call with God is great. Then the Prophet, in the same mode and with a mournful voice, recited the Fatiha and followed it with the decade of verses beginning: We gave Solomon to David, and he was a good and faithful servant (38:30). The entire congregation listened, the Prophet leading them in prayer. After the salutation, this humble one recited the Throne Verse. Bilal repeated, Glory be to God, and I, Praise be to God. Bilal repeated, God is great, and I did the call to prayer in sequence with Bilal. Following the benediction there was a royal tevhid that made me drunk with divine love, as though I had just awakened from sleep.

To sum up the dream: I completed my duties according to Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas’s instructions. The Prophet recited Ya Sin (Sura 36) in the uzzal musical mode with a doleful voice, al-Nasr (Sura 110) three times, and the Mu‘avvizeteyn. Bilal recited a Fatiha. As the Prophet rose to his feet in the prayer niche, Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas at once lay hold of my hand and brought me before him, saying, ‘Your loving and faithful servant, Evliya, begs your intercession.’

He told me to kiss his blessed hand. As I shamelessly put my lips on that blessed hand, out of awe and dread, instead of saying ‘Intercession (şefa‘at), O messenger of God!’ I said, ‘Travel (seyahat), O messenger of God!’ The Prophet smiled and replied, ‘My intercession and my travel and my pilgrimage, may God give you health and well-being.’ He recited a Fatiha, and all the noble Companions recited it after him.

I kissed the hands of everyone present in the assembly and received each one’s blessing. Some of their hands smelled of musk, some of ambergris, some of hyacinths, some of roses, some of sweet basil, some of wild basil, some of violets, some of carnations. But the scent of the Prophet was of a blooming saffron rose. And when I kissed his right hand, it felt as if it had no bones and was soft as cotton. The hands of the other prophets were scented with quinces. The hand of Abu Bakr had a scent of melons, Umar’s of ambergris, Uthman’s of violets, and Ali’s of jasmine; the hand of Hasan smelled of carnations and that of Husayn of white roses. May God be pleased with them all.

When I had duly kissed the hands of the entire congregation, the Prophet again recited a Fatiha and his Companions repeated it in a loud voice. Peace be with you, O brethren! the Prophet pronounced from the prayer-niche and made his way out of the mosque. The Companions gave this humble one various benedictions and they too left the mosque. Only Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas removed his bow-and-arrow case from his waist and girded it on mine, uttering God is great.

‘Go forth,’ he said. ‘Perform the gaza with bow and arrow. Be in God’s protection and safety. And receive these good tidings: Of all the spirits you met in this assembly and whose hands you kissed, you are vouchsafed to visit their tombs. You will be a world traveller and unique among men. The well-protected kingdoms through which you pass, the fortresses and towns, the strange and wonderful monuments, and each land’s praiseworthy qualities and products, its food and drink, its latitude and longitude – record all of these and compose a marvellous work. Make use of my weapon and become my son in this world and the next. Do not abandon the path of truth. Be free of envy and hatred. Pay the due of bread and salt. Be a faithful friend but no friend to the wicked. Learn goodness from the good.’

Having finished his counsel, he kissed my brow and departed from the mosque.

Waking from the sleep of comfort, I was in a quandary, uncertain whether it was a dream or reality or a true vision. As I pondered, my mind was at ease and my heart filled with joy. At dawn I performed my ablution and the morning-prayer, then crossed over from Istanbul to Kasımpaşa and consulted the interpreter of dreams, Ibrahim Efendi, who gave these good tidings, ‘You will be a globe trotter and world traveller. Your journey will be sealed with a good ending. You will be admitted into paradise by the intercession of the Prophet.’ And he recited a Fatiha.

Next, I went to Abdullah Dede, the sheikh of the Mevlevi convent in Kasımpaşa. I kissed his hand and again related my vision. He told me, ‘Since you have kissed the hands of the twelve Imams, you will be a champion in this world. Since you have kissed the hands of the Ten Promised Paradise, you will enter paradise. Since you have kissed the hands of the first four caliphs, you will have the honour of conversing with all the padishahs in the world and will be their boon companion. Since you have beheld the beauty of the Prophet, kissed his hand, and received his blessing, you will attain happiness in both worlds. Following the counsel of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas, do your utmost to chronicle our dear Istanbul; then you will surely obtain the lot that is decreed for you, in accordance with the dictum, What is destined will happen.’

He gave me seven rare and valuable books of chronicles and said, ‘Go forth, may your affair come out right. A Fatiha!’ Having received his benediction, this poor humble one took the treasure of books to a corner of my hovel. And now, having studied some of those histories, I begin the account of my birthplace, the envy of kings and harbour of vessels, mighty fortress of the province of Macedon – Istanbul.





2. The Süleymaniye Mosque




Description of the Mosque of Sultan Süleyman




May God’s mercy and forgiveness be upon him





It was begun in the year 951 (1543) and finished in the year 963 (1557), and is an exemplary mosque beyond description. The learned men who compose histories, and thus strike the die on marble, have confessed the inability and failure of the best chroniclers to celebrate this unequaled mosque. Now, this humble Evliya ventures to write down its praises as much as I am able.

First, this mosque divides in half the ground of the old palace that the Conqueror had earlier built. On top of the high hill, Süleyman Khan built a unique mosque overlooking the sea. How many thousands of master architects, builders, labourers, stonecutters and marble cutters from all the Ottoman dominions had he gathered! And for three whole years 3000 galley slaves, foot-bound in chains, would lay the foundation deep into the ground, so deep that the world-bearing bull at the bottom of the earth could hear the sound of their pickaxes. They dug until they had reached the deepest part, and in three years, by erecting a platform, the foundation was built up to the surface.

In the following year construction was halted while workmen cut stones for the buildings above the foundation. A year later, the prayer-niche was installed to the same measurement as that of the mosque of Sultan Bayezid II the Saint. In three years they completed the walls as far as the vaults of the dome on all four sides. After that, they constructed the lofty dome on top of the solid square pier base.





Features of the Süleymaniye mosque. The bowl of the indigo-coloured dome of this great mosque, up to its lofty summit, is more spherical than that of Aya Sofya, and is seven royal cubits in height.

Apart from the square piers supporting this incomparable dome, there are four porphyry columns on the right and left sides of the mosque, each one worth ten Egyptian treasures. These columns were from the city of (—) in Egypt,1 transported along the Nile to Alexandria. From there Karınca Kapudan (‘Admiral Ant’) loaded them onto rafts and, with favourable wind, brought them to Unkapanıı in Istanbul and then to Vefa Square. When he delivered the four columns to Süleyman Khan at the mosque, he recited the verse:

The ants presented Solomon



A locust’s leg;



Whatever of ours suits you



Accept, I humbly beg.





Süleyman Khan was pleased, and, as a reward for his service, Karınca Kapudan was duly granted the governorship of Yılanlı (Spurie) and Rhodes islands. These four columns of red porphyry are each fifty cubits high. God knows, there is nothing like them in the four corners of the world.

A semi-dome above the prayer-niche and another one above the qibla gate opposite it are fixed to the great dome. But there are no semi-domes resting on the aforementioned piers. In order not to overload them, the chief architect Sinan put windows of cut glass and crystal, (—) in number.

The multicoloured stained windows above the prayer-niche and the pulpit are the work of Sarhoş (‘Drunkard’) Ibrahim. Mere men are too impotent to praise them. At noon, when these windows let in the rays of the world-illuming sun, the mosque interior shines with light, dazzling the eyes of the congregation. Each pane contains a myriad of varicoloured glass bits, in designs of flowers and of the beautiful names of God in calligraphy. They are celebrated by travellers on land and sea as a sight not matched in the heavens.

The prayer-niche and pulpit and the muezzins’ gallery are made of pure white marble. But the master stonecutter set the muezzins’ gallery above (—) columnettes so that it is like the galleries of paradise. The lofty pulpit is made of raw marble and has a crown-like canopy, matched only by the pulpit in the Sinop mosque. And the prayer-niche could be that of Solomon himself. Above the niche, gold on azure by the hand of Karahisari, is inscribed the verse, Whenever Zacharias visited her in the Niche (3:37).

To the right and left of the prayer-niche there are columns with spiral braids that are white magic. Also there are candlesticks tall as a man, gilded with pure brass and gold, which hold candles of camphor wax, each one twenty quintals in weight. The candles are reached by wooden staircases of fifteen steps and are lit every night to illuminate the mosque interior.

In the left corner of this mosque, there is a lofty gallery raised on (—) columns, with a separate prayer-niche, for the sovereign’s private use. Apart from this gallery, there are four others, one in each corner of the four piers, for the Koran reciters. On either side of the mosque there are (—) side benches of stone. Inside the mosque and flanking the side galleries there are congregational galleries resting on columnettes of various sorts. Outside the mosque and overlooking the sea there are again galleries on slender columns, similar to those indoors, and on the right side, the market. When the congregation gets crowded, people perform their devotions on these galleries.

Within the mosque, around the dome, there are two more rows of galleries supported by columns, which on holy nights are lighted with oil lamps. There are 22,000 lamps in total and thousands of chandeliers. And there are (—) windows all around the mosque, through each of which blows a gentle breeze that refreshes the congregation as though they had entered paradise. By God’s command, this mosque has a pleasant fragrance that perfumes the brain; but it has no resemblance to the scent of earthly flowers.

On the side of the qibla gate and next to the two piers in the back of the mosque there is a fountain. The entire congregation drinks from the clear water, satisfying their thirst. And beneath some of the arches on the upper storey there are storage rooms where the notables of the province and thousands of travellers keep their money, the amount of which the Creator only knows.





Praise of the calligraphy of Karahisari. There has never been to this day, nor will there ever be, any calligraphy like that of Ahmed Karahisari both inside and outside this mosque. The Creator granted him success in this field. First, in the centre of the big dome, is inscribed the verse: God is the light of the heavens and earth. His light may be compared to a niche that enshrines a lamp, the lamp within a crystal of star-like brilliance (24:35). He has truly displayed his skill in rendering this Light Verse.

In the semi-dome above the prayer-niche is written: (—). In the semi-dome above the qibla gate is inscribed: I will turn my face to Him who has created the heavens and earth, and will live a righteous life. I am no idolater (6:79). On one of the four piers is inscribed Allah, on another one Muhammad, on another Abu Bakr, and on the last Umar, Uthman, Ali, Hasan, and Husayn. And above the window to the right of the pulpit is the verse: Temples are built for God’s worship; invoke in them no other god besides Him (72:18).

Apart from these, over the upper storey windows, are written the beautiful names of God. These are in the şikafi style, while the large inscriptions in the dome are in the güzafi style where every alif and lam and kaf is ten cubits tall – they were written in proportion to the height of the dome, so that they can be read plainly from below.

This mosque has five doors. On the right side is the imam’s door; on the left, below the sultan’s gallery, is the viziers’ door; and there are two side doors. Written over the left side door is: Peace be to you for all that you have steadfastly endured. Blessed is the recompense of paradise (13:24). Written over the right side door is: (—) (—) (—) (—). And the inscription above the qibla gate is:

[2 lines empty]

In this inscription is added: Ahmed Karahisari wrote this in the year (—).





Description of the white courtyard. A flight of (—) stone steps leads up to the above mentioned portals of felicity of the noble mosque and to the three lofty gates of the delightful courtyard. This courtyard is a white plateau paved with white marble, every slab the size of a carpet, smoothed and polished and even, forming a crystalline valley. It is square in shape and, along with its side galleries measures (—) feet. But the mosque interior is larger than the courtyard, the distance from the qibla door to the prayer-niche being (—) feet and the width (—) feet. Above the side galleries, forty feet wide, that go all around this courtyard, over the varicoloured piers, there are (—) precious columns. And rising above these column are varicoloured stone arches, giving the impression of a rainbow. Still further above and all around are (—) domes.

Overlooking this courtyard on all four sides are (—) windows, each with iron gratings and bars thick as one’s arm. The master ironsmith wrought these windows with the skill of David, wielding his file so that even now no trace of dust affects their polished surface which gleams like Nakhchivan steel. And over these windows are (—) panes of glass.

In the middle of this white courtyard is a square basin that has to be seen, a work of white magic. But it is not for ablutions – all four sides have marble latticework, and the congregation drinks its Water of Life. It is roofed by a squat dome covered with flat leaden tiles. The strange thing is that because jets spring up from the basin, it is called a fountain, but the water actually flows down from the dome like the Salsabil fountain in paradise. It is a marvellous spectacle that amazes anyone who inspects it.

Over the windows along the qibla gallery of this courtyard, the verse (—) (—) (—) is inscribed on azure porcelain tiles. The verse (—) (—) (—) is written over the gate on the left side, the verse (—) (—) (—) over the gate on the right side, and the verse (—) (—) (—) over the qibla gate.

This qibla gate is the tallest of all the gates and unequaled on earth in its fine white marble filagree decoration. The master stonecutter has joined the blocks together such that no man can differentiate between them. Above the lintel and within the marble recesses resembling a prayer-niche, there are nodding tulips and an array of other carvings, and marble chandeliers suspended by chains, wrought with the skill of Jamshid. On either side of this gate, in cells four stories high that reach up to the dome, dwell the timekeeper, the caller of the hours of prayer, the gatekeepers and caretakers.

Just inside this gate, the floor is paved with a large round block of red porphyry that is an unparalleled piece of polished stone. It is the size of a Muhammadan dinner-spread, and one side is slightly cracked.

Then, to the right, is a square slab of porphyry on which a cross was engraved, traces of which are still visible. The infidels offered a million of money for it, but it was not for sale. Finally, during a water festival, a şahi cannon was deliberately fired over the mast of the infidel galleons moored at Galata. The ball broke the threshold of the left gate of the courtyard of the Süleymaniye mosque, rolled onto the slab with the cross and came to a stop. But since it was set in the ground, it was not damaged. The import of this is that the cursed Franks were so hostile, and the master gunner so skillful, that they could take aim from Galata and strike the threshold of the Süleymaniye. Traces of the strike are still visible, and people come to view it.

On the pedestals of the columns along the four sides of this courtyard, there are brass plates on which are incised all the great events, such as fires and earthquakes, enthronements and public uprisings, and the like. The engraver of the chronograms is provided for by the endowment. They are marvellous pedestals with dated inscriptions.





Description of the minarets. This mosque has four minarets, each one used for the Muhammadan call. Since Sultan Süleyman Khan was the tenth Padishah of the Ottoman dynasty, ten galleries were built on the four minarets. The two adjoining the mosque have three galleries each, and the climb to these incomparable minarets is (—) hundred steps. The two minarets in the rear corners of the courtyard are lower and have two well-proportioned galleries each.

The minaret on the left with the three galleries is called the Jewel Minaret. The reason is that, in order for the foundation to settle, Süleyman Khan had the building of this mosque stop for a year and built other pious works. Shah Tahmasp, the king of Persia, when he heard of the halt to construction, dispatched a great embassy with 1000 purses of money and a box of all kinds of valuable jewels. In his letter he wrote, ‘I heard that you did not have the funds to complete the mosque and so you put a halt. Due to your friendship, I have sent to you this amount of money from the treasury and these jewels. Sell them and spend the money, and take pains to finish the mosque. Let us have a share in your pious works.’

The emissary arrived with such taunting letters before Süleyman Khan, who was surrounded by a sea of labourers and masons employed about the mosque. Süleyman was incensed by the letter. In the presence of the emissary he distributed the 1000 purses of money to the Jews in Istanbul, and not a grain was left. He addressed the emissary, saying:

The heretic on judgement day



Will be an ass beneath the Jew.





To your masters the Jews then, who will mount you when the time comes, let your money be allotted, so that when they do mount you on judgment day, they may spare you the spur and whip. Otherwise, what do folk like you who reject ritual prayer have to do with pious works like founding a mosque?’

Then he gave the architect Sinan the box of jewels while the emissary was still present and said to him: ‘The so-called precious stones he sent are worthless beside the stones of my mosque. So put them with the rest and use them in the construction.’ When the emissary had understood the situation, he was dumbstruck. Several facetious letters were written in reply to the emissary’s letter, and he set out toward Revan (Erevan, part of the Safavid kingdom at that time).

Meanwhile, the chief architect used the jewels to decorate the grooves of that minaret with artistry of all sorts, also for the marble roses decorating the inscriptions. This is why it is called the ‘Jewel Minaret’. Some of the stones shine when the sun’s rays strike, but others have faded and lost their lustre from exposure to the heat, snow, and rain. However, in the centre of the arch above the qibla gate, there is a Nishapur turquoise as large as a round bowl that dazzles the beholder.

On both sides of this mosque, there are forty taps for renewing ablutions.





Description of the bower of the light-filled tomb. Within a bow-shot’s distance from the prayer-niche wall, in the midst of a rose garden, is the tomb of Süleyman Khan, may his earth be sweet. He lies under a lofty dome that has no match beneath this celestial dome. For the master builder has put a larger dome on top of a smaller dome. Such a well-wrought dome, with such a strange and wonderful design, and such artful and intricate carvings of marble, is not to be seen in any other country.





Description of the outer courtyard. On three sides of this mosque there is also a single-layered outer courtyard. Two sides are an arena long enough for a horse to gallop in. It is a vast courtyard adorned with lofty plane trees, weeping willows, cypresses, lindens, and ashes. And on its three walls are (—) windows in total.

The courtyard has ten gates: two on the qibla side, the Mera Gate and the Old Palace Gate; on the south side, the Mekteb Gate, Market Gate, Sağmedrese Gate, and Chief Physician’s Gate; on the west, the Imaret (Soup Kitchen) Gate, Tevhane (Guesthouse) Gate, and the Agha’s Gate, reached by (—) steps. On the north is the Dome Gate of 1001 Nails, reached by twenty stone steps – it is called so because that was the number of nails used to construct the dome. And on the east side is the Hammam Gate, with (—) steps leading down to the public bath. On this side, the courtyard is not enclosed by a wall but by a low parapet so that one can view Istanbul. The entire congregation stops here to enjoy a panoramic view of the imperial palace, Üsküdar, Boğazhisarı (Rumeli Kavağı), Beşiktaş, Tophane, Galata, Kasımpaşa, and Okmeydanı. And there are fine views of the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus, with thousands of ferries and caiques plying the waters and other boats unfurling their sails.

The circumference of the Süleymaniye mosque, around the four sides of this courtyard, is (—) thousand paces.

There is also a small courtyard between the Süleymaniye and the walls of the old palace. It is known as the Pehlivan Demir square, after the chief of the wrestlers. All the champions from the Lodge of Wrestlers grapple with one another at that pleasant place after the mid-afternoon prayer. The proper Turkish term is güraş.

To the right and left of this mosque, there are the four great medreses for the chief muftis of the four schools of law, filled completely with men of the most profound learning.

There is also a Hadith school, a Koran recitation school, a medical college, a primary school, a hospital, a soup kitchen and dining hall, a guesthouse, a caravanserai for travellers, and a palace for the Janissary Agha; markets for goldsmiths, button makers and boot makers; a resplendent public bath; quarters for theological students; and 1000 houses for servants. 1001 domes can be counted in the vicinity of this mosque.

Seen from Galata, the Süleymaniye complex seems like a vast city covered with dark blue lead. There is a total of 3000 servants attached to it. They are maintained by secure endowments from Süleyman Khan, including the revenues of several islands in the Aegean – such as Sönbeki (Symi), Istanköy (Cos), Sakız (Chios) and Rhodes – that are governed by the endowment’s administrator and his 500 agents.

Because Süleyman Khan is the conqueror of the seven climes, his name is mentioned not only here but in (—) Friday sermons. And in all the lands of Islam, there is no building stronger and more solid than the Süleymaniye. All architectural experts agree on this, and also that nowhere on earth has such an enamel dome been seen.

Within and outside this mosque the foundation is firm, the buildings elegant, and every piece of ornamentation the work of wondrous magic of extreme perfection. When the construction ended, the Grand Architect Sinan said, ‘My Padishah, I have built for you a mosque so solid that on Judgement Day, when the mountains of the world are carded like cotton, the dome of this mosque will roll like a polo ball before the carder’s bow string of Hallaj Mansur.’2



Indeed, built on a lofty hill, the foundations are firmly supported by walls below, beginning from the upper wall of Tahtakale, to the wall of the palace of Siyavuş Pasha, to that of the Janissary Agha, to the cistern wall of Küçükbazar, and to the walls of the Agha’s school, the guest house, the soup kitchen, the lead magazine, and the hospital.

Once, this humble one observed ten Frankish infidels with expert knowledge of geometry and architecture who were touring this light-filled mosque. The gatekeepers had let them in, and the caretakers had given them special shoes so they could walk around and see it. Wherever they looked, they put finger to mouth and bit it in astonishment. But when they saw the doors inlaid with Indian mother-of-pearl, they shook their head and bit two fingers each. And when they saw the enamel dome, they threw off their Frankish hats and cried out in awe, ‘Maria, Maria!’

Then they saw the four vaults at the skirt of the dome, resembling the Vault of Chosroes. They are like the rainbow, in accordance with the verse:

Like the milky way, with head raised high



He threw the lasso to the vault of the sky.





– each one as it were a vault created by the hand of God. {In fact, these vaults can be dated from kudret kemeri (‘Vault of Power’), the year 944 (1537).}3

They gazed at these arches and at the rest of the mosque’s interior for an entire hour, with finger in mouth, then went outside into the courtyard. When they saw the four minarets, the four pedestals, the six lofty gates, the delightful courtyard and surrounding arches and domes, the columns and row on row of well-proportioned cupolas topped by gilded Muhammadan finials, their eyes were dazzled from the splendour. Once again they threw off their hats and walked all around this noble mosque bareheaded. Now in their awe they bit all ten fingers, that being their way of expressing extreme astonishment.

This humble one requested their interpreter to ask them how they liked this building. One of them turned out to be capable of speech. He said, ‘All things, whether created beings or man-made structures, are beautiful either on the inside or on the outside. Rarely are the two beauties found together. But both the interior and the exterior of this mosque were constructed with such grace and refinement. In all of Frengistan we have not seen an edifice built to such perfection as this.’

‘How does this mosque compare with Aya Sofya?’ I asked.

‘To be sure,’ they answered, ‘that is a larger building, constructed with brick, and an ancient work, solid and well-built for its time. But this is a finer construction in terms of grace, elegance, and beauty. It also required greater expenditure than Aya Sofya.’

In fact, they say that every ten miskals of stone used in this mosque cost one gold piece.





Expenditures for the Süleymaniye Mosque. When the mosque was completed, all its expenses – according to the accounts of the superintendent of construction, overseer, and treasurer – amounted to 890,383 yük of florins.

1 In Vol. 10, fol. 383a Evliya identifies the source of these columns as Luxor.



2 The mountains ‘carded like cotton’ are reminiscent of the Koranic image of the mountains on the Day of Judgement being ‘like tufts of carded wool’ (101:5); while the mention of carding evokes the ninth-century Sufi martyr al-Hallaj whose name means ‘The Carder’.

3. The antiquity of smoking





A curiosity. This ancient mausoleum (tomb of Sultan Mustafa), was built by King (—) at the time of the construction of Aya Sofya, (—) years before the Prophet. So it is a thousand and (—) years old. While (recently) the master builder and miners, with chisels like that of Farhad, were carving a hole in the south wall to put in a window, an iron tobacco pipe appeared between two bricks. All of them saw it, and they could still detect the scent of tobacco smoke. This is evident proof that smoking tobacco is an ancient practice.





4. Galata





Chapter 246: Account of the ancient edifice and great fortress of the city of Galata, its founding, its features, the buildings within it, and all its qualities


First, King (—) built the fortress of Constantinople after the time of Alexander the Great. The area of Galata was a meadow of pleasant air and a rich pasture where shepherds tended their sheep and cows, always milking them and bringing the milk to the king. Since delicious milk came from this fertile pasture, it was named Galata – galata being the Greek word for milk. Later, in order to quarter the shepherds, a fortress-like shelter was built near the present-day Kurşumlu Mahzen (‘Lead-Covered Magazine’). And so Galata became more and more built up, until the reign of (—).

{It is north of Istanbul, and a mile-wide strait separates them. It is eighteen miles long, reaching Kağıthane at its western extremity. One crosses from Stanbul to Galata by caique, ferry, or barge. In the era of the infidels there was a bridge of chains.}

[…]

Circumference of the walled town of Galata. Its circuit is 10,060 paces. In the year (—) (1634), when Sultan Murad IV went on his expedition to Revan, his lieutenant Bayram Pasha repaired and whitewashed the walls of Galata and measured them with an architect’s cubit. The circuit, together with all the towers and ramparts, was calculated to be 18,000 cubits. There are 205 towers and 13,000 crenellations. The height of the walls is forty royal cubits. Some of the towers are eighty royal cubits in height.

But Galata Tower, built by Mehmed the Conqueror, is 118 cubits high, and its sky-scraping summit is covered with lead. From nowhere can one see the entire circuit of the walls of Istanbul, and its triangular shape, except from Galata Tower. In clear weather, the Mountain of Monks (Cebel-i Ruhban, today Uludağ) which looms over Bursa is visible, and even the buildings of Bursa can be seen through a spyglass. {This tower, cylindrical in shape, is visible from three parasangs’ distance.} The tower interior was a dungeon in ten layers; it is now a storage for Ottoman naval equipment. It has a single iron gate that opens to the south and is reached by a stone staircase of (—) steps. This humble one used to fly paper from there (i.e., from the top of the tower). One time I strung a rope to get a tightrope walker’s view of Istanbul.

On the land side of Galata Tower is a deep moat, extending from Meyyit Gate to Tophane Gate. I have seen thousands of fortresses but never a moat like this; only that of Akkerman, where the Dniester flows into the Black Sea, might match it. There are always sailors in this trench twisting ship cables, marlines, and life ropes. It is broad and deep, and all along its edge are graveyards and cemeteries. {But there is no moat on the sea side, which is entirely covered with markets.}

[…]

This city has eighteen Muslim quarters, seventy quarters of Greek infidels, three of cranky Franks, one of Jews, and two of Armenians. No infidels reside in the first castle, and none at all in the second castle as far as the Arab mosque – the inhabitants of the quarter possess a noble rescript from Mehmed the Conqueror according to which no infidel is allowed in, and if they see an armed Christian they give no quarter and kill him immediately. The majority of these inhabitants are grief-stricken Mudejars who came from Spain, driven out by the infidels, in the time of Sultan Ahmed. If they see an armed infidel in Galata, they kill him right away.

Aside from these two castles, the two walled areas of Galata as far as Tophane are filled with Franks of the Seven Kings (i.e., from the Habsburg Empire) and other Christians. According to the land survey of Murad (IV) Khan, there are 200,000 infidels and 64,000 Muslims. May God preserve it.

There are seventy churches. First, the Church of the Organ belonging to France. It is on a dyke; the gate is reached by a staircase of seven steps.

Near it is the Venetian church. It had burnt down, and lay in ruins for twenty years until it was restored at the time of the Candia truce (1669) by permission of Köprülüzade Ahmed Pasha. It has a sky-scraping square bell tower.

Inside and outside these churches, there are strange and wonderful images and icons that seem to be alive.

The Greeks have (—) churches.

[1 line empty]

They have one hospital according to their false claim.

[1 line empty]

The Armenians have three churches.

[1 line empty]

And the Jews have two synagogues. But the Jews are always in fear of these infidels (i.e., Christians).

As for the infidel quarters, they are patrolled day and night, because they have girded their loins for rebellion more than once, and many of them were put to the sword.

[…]

The manners and customs of the inhabitants of Galata. The people of Galata are in (—) categories: the first are sailors, the second merchants, the third craftsmen of various sorts, and the fourth joiners and caulkers. Most of them wear clothing of Cezayir (the Aegean archipelago) {because they are mainly marines. There are fabulously rich captains, among them Elvan Kapudan.}

The Greeks are tavern keepers. The Armenians are sellers of pressed meat (pastırma) and wealthy merchants. The Jews are intermediaries in the marketplace. The Jewish boys are male prostitutes – there is no more despised group of catamites than they.





The praiseworthy food and drink of the city of Galata. First is the fine white Mudejar francala bread. The thousands of coloured candies, flavoured with musk and ambergris and worthy of a padishah, in the glass jars at the confectioners’ market are found nowhere else, unless it be paradise-scented Damascus. The Mudejars also sell spiced sweetmeats topped with decorative leaves and spiced ring-bread (simit).

Among the artisans are sellers of compasses and watches, cut-crystal lenses and hourglasses, and infidel apothecaries.

As for drinks, in the taverns – named Taş Nerdüben (‘Stone Steps’), Kefeli, Manyalı, Mihalaki, Kaşkaval, Sünbüllü, Kostanti, and Saranda – are sold various notorious forbidden ruby-dripping wines, including misket (from Bulgaria) and wines from Ancona, Syracuse, Mudanya, Erdemit, and Bozcaada (Tenedos). When I pass through that wicked locale and see hundreds of downtrodden tavern-slaves lying in the highway, bareheaded and barefooted, and inquire about their wretched state, some put forth this verse:

I am so drunk I do not know



What is worldly or divine.



Who am I? Who is the cupbearer?



What is the crimson wine?





Or:

I have quaffed his ruby wine:



Drunk I am, drunk I am!



Captivated by his locks,



Mad I am, mad I am!





Or:

My foot takes no step but to the tavern,



My hand holds nothing but the cup of wine.



Stop the rant, preacher! My ear hears nothing



But the bottle’s glugging and the drunken cry.





Some denizens of the tavern recite this couplet:

Ascetic, to the tavern



Politely go.



What this convent is



Do you think you know?





This humble one swears by God the Knower of Secrets that I have never partaken of a single drop of these intoxicants. Being of a sociable and impertinent nature, I have mingled among all the craftsmen and learned their secrets. But I only drank sherbet of Athenian honey, known as Mudejar sherbet. Galata has such types of craftsmen. But these bankrupted drunkards and addicts are put in the dungeon just inside the Yağkapanı Gate to reform their manners.

This city, because of the delightful climate, is famous for its darling boys and girls. Its blessings are abundant for rich and poor alike. All the people are impertinent lovers, of dervish temperament. They are famous for their salons in wintertime. When the grand ship captains return from their voyages, they take all their friends in their faluccas and frigates to the vineyards in Boğazhisarı and have intimate gatherings.

The harbour of Galata, being an extremely fine one, is protected from the eight winds, and in winter time 1000 ships lay anchor here without fear. The suburb to the north of the walled town of Galata is considered to belong to Tophane, because it has a separate governor. There is no record of (Muslim) pilgrimage sites in Galata.





5. Kağıthane





The pleasure-park and resort lodge of world-adorning Kağıthane.


It is a promenade famous among travellers in Arabia and Persia, India and Yemen and Ethiopia. The Turkish poets have penned the praises of its air and water. It is a delightful river that flows through the valleys of Levend-çiftlik near the Bosphorus. Fullers wash their turbans and shirts and trousers without the need for soap – after two rinses the garments come out fresh as a white rose. Some Indian merchants bring their stuffs to Kağıthane and dip them in the water just once, which is sufficient to clean them.

On both sides of the river are grassy meadows with clover, alfalfa, couch grass, levşe (?), buttercups, and tulips; and shady bowers adorned with thousands of plane trees and poplars and weeping willows. In the river one gets sweet flag, the like of which is not found at Azov or in the lake of Kanizsa and whose root is extremely beneficial.

On holidays, thousands of old and young lovers come to this place to flirt with one another and go out in caiques and ferries. Some come with their boy sweethearts to take a plunge in the river and swim and embrace without fear. It is a river of love. But the tree roots along the banks sometimes catch the feet of swimmers like fishing nets and drag them down to a watery death, crying, ‘Oh, a sea sprite has got me!’ So one must be cautious, even though there are no sea sprites. Withal, thousands of sweethearts wrap their rosy pink bodies, like peeled almonds, with indigo-coloured silk aprons, then dive into the river like fish and flatter their lovers. There is much commotion, with musical entertainments in every corner worthy of Husayn Bayqara. In charge of this place of enjoyment is a regiment of janissary conscripts and their colonel, who also oversee the gunpowder mill.





Praise of the gunpowder mill. Bayezid the Saint built it at the border of this Spring of Life in the year (—). Later, Süleyman Khan made it into a stone building roofed with lead. But the dome is not made of stone. The staff, from the munitions corps, includes the chief gunpowder maker, his warden and guards, and 200 soldiers.

In this factory are 100 bronze mortars, each weighing ten quintals; and various wheelwork mechanisms that have to be seen and cannot be explained in words. There are also water wheels on the river. When the barrages are opened, the water wheels turn, as do the wheelworks inside them. Then iron pestles, each weighing 40 to 50 okkas, pound and grind the gunpowder in the mortars, while the workers stir it with wooden sticks. Heaven help us, if an iron pestle strikes a mortar and a spark lights the gunpowder, all the workers get blown in the air like the birds of Ababil (105:3). It is a dangerous place, and not a pretty sight. And the thundering noise from the wheels turning and the pestles pounding makes a man tremble to the marrow of his bones. It is a noteworthy sight for reckless tourists. Those who are sensible will view it from a distance and then will repair to the lodge of Kağıthane for carousing.

For this lodge has thousands of benches and galleries for lovers to sit in, a seventy-hearth kitchen and pantry worthy of Kay Kavus, twenty shops, a bread oven, a coffee house, a mosque, and a well of sweet water. There are 200 cells for the janissary conscripts, and storerooms full of dishes, pans, ladles, kettles, and copper utensils. Lovers who wish may put up here as guests for fifteen nights and enjoy themselves.

Once every forty years,4 in this meadow of Kağıthane, the guild of goldsmiths assembles and holds parties for twenty days and nights according to the kanun of Süleyman Khan the Goldsmith. Guildsmen from all the Ottoman dominions flock to this festival, 300 purses are spent on it, and 12,000 journeymen graduate to become master goldsmiths. And it is a kanun of Süleyman Khan that the Ottoman Padishah in person attend this great gathering, pitch his Solomonic tent-pavilion, and give the chief goldsmith a gift of twelve purses. For when Süleyman was a prince in the city of Trabzon, he apprenticed under the Greek master Kostanta and himself became a goldsmith. Later, when he became sultan, he founded the goldsmiths’ workshop near the Water-carriers’ fountain.

First, twelve goldsmith apprentices kiss the hand of the glorious Padishah, then that of the şeyhülislam and the other great viziers, then the hands of the chief goldsmith, their sheikh, and their warden, and lastly the other masters, as established by Süleyman Khan. Then the chief goldsmith presents gifts to the Padishah – such as a chest, an inkstand, a bridle, a sword, or a scimitar – all encrusted with jewels.

In short, in the valley of Kağıthane, five to six thousand tents and pavilions are pitched. It is a sea of men for twenty days, and powerful torches turn the nights into bright days, as on the night of the Feast of the Sacrifice.

Once every twenty years the saddle makers’ guild also has an outing here, and that is also a noteworthy event. And every year, from the first day to the last day of the month of Sha‘ban, the people of Istanbul pitch tents in this plain of Kağıthane in anticipation of the fast of Ramadan. For a whole month they make amusements, under the name of şeb-bük.5 Such a place of joy is Kağıthane.





The town of Kağıthane is situated 1000 paces north of this promenade. It has 200 houses of Muslims with Iram-like gardens. There is the mosque of (—) Hatun who was (—)’s wetnurse (daya), with the following chronogram over the qibla door:

[1 line empty]



There are also a fine bath and twenty shops. In Byzantine times there was a paper mill (kağızhane) here, a large structure with masonry domes. And there were water wheels turned by the river that passed beneath the Daya Hatun mosque. The paper mill is now in ruins, but it could easily be restored and turned into a gunpowder mill.

In this place and as far as the wooden bridge there are lofty plane trees on both sides of the river, reaching up to the sky, on whose branches nest myriads of herons. Their plumes, that are left behind on their perches, are collected by the keeper of Emirguneoğlu’s garden (today’s Emirgan).





Convent of the fire-worshipping Hindus. It is on the western side of this town, a small convent with a grassy meadow and a few weeping willows. If a Hindu dies in Istanbul and its environs, the body is brought here and cremated. This humble one witnessed it three times.





Convent of the Indian Kalender dervishes. It is at the head of the Kağıthane bridge. They are all Muslims. Sultan Ibrahim Khan, like Ibrahim ibn Adham (a famous Sufi, d. 777), used to set aside his crown and share food with the dervishes at this Indian convent.

4 Elsewhere (Vol. 1, fol. 186a) Evliya reports that this festival is held once every twenty years, and that he attended it three times.

5 A rare word apparently signifying hand-clapping or the like; see Dankoff 2008, 215.





6. Guilds’ parade





Chapter 8: Guild of Mediterranean captains


[…]

Following the procession of the Mediterranean Sea captains, the butchers were supposed to pass, according to imperial decree. But all the great Egyptian grain merchants, including dealers in rice, hemp, Egyptian reed mats, coffee and sugar gathered together and began quarrelling with the butchers. Finally they went before the sultan and said, ‘My Padishah, our galleons are charged with transporting rice, lentils, coffee, and hemp. They cannot do without us, nor we without them. Why should these bloody and tricky butchers come between us? Plagues have arisen from cities where they shed their blood, and for fear of this their stalls and shambles in other countries are outside of the city walls. They are a bloody and filthy band of ill-omen. We, on the other hand, always make Istanbul plentiful and cheap with grains of all sorts.’

Now the butchers’ eyes went bloodshot.

‘My Padishah,’ they said, ‘Our patron saint is Kassab Cömerd and our occupation is with sheep, an animal that the Creator has made the object of mercy, and whose flesh He has made lawful food for the strengthening of His servants’ bodies. Bread and meat are mentioned as the foremost of God’s gifts to mankind: with a small portion of meat, a poor man can subsist for five or six days. We make our living with such a lawful trade, and are known for our generosity (cömerdlik). It is we who make Istanbul plentiful and cheap. As for these merchants and dealers and profiteers: concerning them the Koran says, God has made selling lawful and profiteering unlawful (2:275). They are such a despised group that after bringing their goods from Egypt they store it in magazines in order to create a shortage, thus causing public harm through their hoarding.

‘The Ottoman state has no need of their rice in the first place, because there is excellent rice already available from Filibe and Beypazarı and (—). Nor do the people Turkey have a need for Egyptian hemp which they praise so highly, since there are various kinds of hemp available from Manastır, Florunya, Serfice, Tırhala, and Drama in Rumelia, and from numerous places in Anatolia, not to speak of the linen and cotton shirts from Trabzon which are sold for a straw – one can get a beddavi shirt for 20 dirhems – so why do we need your hemp, which anyway has been the cause of so many huge fires in Istanbul? As for the lentils you speak of, this is a product found all over Rumelia and Anatolia.

‘Egyptian sugar? But in the Koran the rivers of paradise are praised as being made of pure honey (47:15). Now we have honey from Turkey, Athens, Wallachia, Moldavia, each with seventy distinct qualities. Furthermore, if my Padishah wished, thousands of quintals of sugar could be produced in Alanya, Antalya, Silifke, Tarsus, Adana, Payas, Antakya, Aleppo, Damascus, Sidon, Beirut, Tripoli and other such provinces – enough to make it plentiful and cheap throughout the world – so why do we need your sugar?

‘As for coffee: it is an innovation; it prevents sleep; it dulls the generative powers; and coffee houses are dens of sedition. When roasted, it is burnt; and in the legal compilations know as Bazzaziya and Tatarkhaniya6 we have the dictum that Whatever is carbonised is absolutely forbidden – this holds even for burnt bread. Spiced sherbet, pure milk, tea, fennel, salep, and almond-cream – all these are more wholesome than coffee.



‘You speak of henna. True, it is a Sunna of the Prophet, used by women and to dye the white beards of old men. But if you pound laudanum root in a mortar, mix it with water, and rub it in your hair or beard, it makes an excellent red dye, and furthermore rids hair and beard of lice and dust; so we have no need of your henna either.’

To these objections of the butchers, the Egyptian replied, ‘Our rice is fine and white and cooks nicely, especially that grown in the regions of Manzala, Damietta, Faraskur and Birimbal, which has a wonderfully fragrant scent when cooked with butter. Before the Prophet there was no rose-water, rice, bananas, or jujubes; so the creation of rice is one of the miracles of the Prophet. As for our lentils, they are mentioned in the Koran – and lentils (2:61) – and grow in the soil of paradise and in the water of Egypt, and are tastier and cook better than the lentils of Turkey. No henna in any other land compares with our henna, and there is no argument that its use is a prophetic Sunna. It is true that Turkey has no need of sugar and hemp, and that sugar from Frengistan is also very fine. But tell us this, O band of butchers: What benefit and return do you offer to the public treasury?’

The butchers had nothing to say to this, and the Egyptian merchants continued, ‘My Padishah, the goods arriving in our galleons provide the public treasury an annual revenue of 11,000 purses from customs dues. As a matter of justice, we ought to have precedence in the Muhammadan procession and the butchers ought to come after us.’

The şeyhülislam Yahya Efendi and Mu‘id Ahmed Efendi cited the Hadith, The best of men is he who is useful to mankind, and the sultan gave the Egyptian merchants a noble rescript authorising them to go first, and the butchers to go second.





Chapter 28: Guild of furriers


They are 1,000 men, with 500 shops, and their patron saint also is the prophet Idris, since they work with needles. But it was Hushang Shah who first hunted animals and wore their skins.7 He roamed the mountains in the guise of those animals in order to hunt them. Other people wore them in imitation of him, and took pleasure in wearing them. The patron saint of furriers at the time of the Prophet was Amr ibn Amiri. His light-filled tomb is in (—) (—) (—) and he is the fourteenth patron saint to be girded by Salman Pak.

A marvellous battle broke out between the furriers and the tanners. Finally the sultan and the nobles and grandees decided that wearing furs was a necessity and the order was given for them to go in advance accompanied by a special military band.

So they file past with their shops on drawn carts and carried on shoulders, adorned with the furs of sable, ermine, marten, red squirrel and Russian silver fox, the head and leg furs of sable, the neck furs of duck, swan and goldfinch, the neck and belly furs of fox, and the furs of astrakhan lambskin, all worth hundreds of thousand of guruş.

Next, the Greek furriers in the Mahmudpaşa market form a separate grand procession, wearing hundreds of furs which they put on backward.8 On their heads are outlandish bearskin caps. Their trousers are also animal skins. Some are covered head to foot with skins of leopard, tiger, lion and wolf. Others have sable kalpak crowns on their heads and pikes and javelins in their hands, and pass with their horses, also smothered in animal skins.

Another group wrap themselves in animal skins, pretending to be wild men, each one dragged along by five or six men with chains. These wild men of strange aspect – Heaven help us! – make mock attacks on the spectators, frightening them out of their wits. Others dress up as demons or fairies and stand on their heads, then leap to their feet and attack the crowd. Some are strangely attired as jinn, confounding the minds of any who see them. Still others put on lion or leopard or tiger skins and go on all fours, giving the onlookers threatening glances, and are hardly restrained from attacking them by their keepers who drag them along by chains and strike them with rattan staffs.



Next some men in skins of bear, boar, wolf, stag and roe deer enter the arena unchained and swaying back and forth. Behind them come a band of hunters with their motley hounds and brandishing pikes and maces. They attack the first group as though they were hunting boars and bears and wolves, and so pass before the sultan.





Guild of sable kalpak makers. Eighty shops and 105 individuals. Their patron saint is unknown. This headgear is the crown of the Chingissids. They deck their shops with sable kalpaks and entertain the crowds by stuffing kalpaks with cotton and manipulating the resulting puppets with strings.





Guild of sable merchants. 1,000 individuals, all of them Rumelian Greeks – from the cities of Serfice, Florunya, Liçista and Gölikesri – with no religion and no patron saint. They are wealthy merchants who every year import sables and squirrels and other furs from Muscovy. They put their sables on backward and pass in parade with their litters and horses adorned head to foot with sables and with leech teeth, also known as fish teeth.9





Guild of falconers {and other hunters}. 200 individuals. They are the furriers’ hunters and possess sultanic rescripts exempting them from taxes. None of the other hunters – whether the chief falconers, or the keepers of hounds of the palace gardeners or of the janissaries, or the janissaries of the Istıranca hunters’ corps – can interfere with these furriers’ hunters. They shoot swans, goldfinches, mallard drakes and speckled ducks in the Great and Little Çekmece inlets and in the Terkoz lakes, and give their throat-fur to the chief furrier and their wings to the chief arrowsmith. They too pass in procession with their game.





Guild of leopard keepers. One agha – his shop is in the Lions’ Den (Arslanhane) – and fifty-five individuals. Because the chief furrier possesses leopard skins and lynx skins, these leopard keepers parade with all the sultan’s leopards, dragging them along by gold and silver chains10 and keeping them in check with rattan staffs, crying ‘My leopard did not take it, my leopard did not see it!’





Guild of lion keepers. Their patron saint was Ali, the Lion of God, at whose feet all the wild beasts used to grovel. The chief lion keeper, in charge of lions and tigers, was originally supposed to march with the mastiff sheepdog keepers under the authority of the chief butcher; but the chief furrier persuaded the sultan to have them under his authority instead, since he had control over the skinning and tanning of lion and tiger skins. So the fifty lion-keepers too go in the procession with the furriers, dragging their chained lions and tigers – and panthers, bears, wolves and hyenas – like so many vicious dragons.

Following them come the Greek and Muslim darling boys (i.e., apprentices) of all the furriers, with their Tatar kalpaks and armed to the teeth.

The chief falconer of the furriers, the chief leopard keeper, the deputy of the chief lion keeper, and the chief furrier go together in front, stirrup to stirrup and bridle to bridle, dressed in the finery of their respective guilds. Following after are their darling boys and their eightfold band, all passing in ceremony.

This guild of furriers is very necessary to the Ottomans, whether at home or on campaign.





Chapter 34: Guild of barbers


[…]

Guild of circumcision barbers. They are 400 men, with 300 shops, and their patron saint is Abu’l-Hawakin Muhammad ibn Talha ibn Abdullah. Salman Pak girded him and he circumcised all those who were honoured with the glory of Islam. But the Prophet, by God’s command, when he was born from his mother Amina, was already circumcised, and his eyes were tinged with kohl.

The wife of Abu’l-Hawakin Muhammad was Rabi‘a, daughter of Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud. She circumcised her chaste-starred daughter by cutting off the excess flesh called the ‘little red tongue’ in the middle of her vagina. This was first done by (—) (Sarah), Abraham’s wife, who out of anger at Hagar had circumcised her by cutting off that very flesh. Since that time, the practice of circumcising girls has become peculiar to Arabia. Even in Egypt there are a people known as Hadari who make great merriment on the night of the circumcision of girls. The advantage of this for women, reportedly, is that it eases childbirth.

Here the circumcisers adorn their shops drawn on carts with various circumcision razors and, as they pass by in procession with drums and tambourines, pretend to circumcise some boys.





Chapter 41: Guild of acrobats


First are the master acrobats, i.e., tightrope walkers, who perform world-admiring feats. In Istanbul today there are thirteen masters, each one capable of climbing to the sky on rope ladders and conversing with Jesus and the cherubim. First is Mehmed Çelebi of Üsküdar, then Hacı Nasir of the Maghreb, Hacı Ali of Alexandria, Şaşı Hüsam of Harput, Kubadi of Bursa, Kara Şücah of Arapgir, Kemberoğlu, and Kız Pehlivan. They exhibit their skill in the Padishah’s presence, wearing Kubadi slippers, some with balancing beam, some without, some with a tray in each hand and a donkey on their backs, or with a naked sword in each hand – in short, demonstrating their skill with one of the 260 props used by acrobats. They are Arab and Persian, Indian and Yemeni masters, who have set foot in the heavenly sphere at the summit of Galata Tower.

Chief of the guild, appointed by a noble rescript, is Mehmed Çelebi of Üsküdar, who performed in the Hippodrome on the occasion of the imperial circumcision. According to his register, there is a total of 200 tightrope walkers wandering about this island world, with 2,000 men in their train.

Their patron saint is Dawud Habli, son of Imru’l-Qays. Dawud scaled the fortress of Khaybar by tightrope and upon its conquest was girded as patron of the tightrope walkers by Salman the Persian. His tomb is in Hamadan. His father Imru’l-Qays was unique of his age, one of the most eloquent of the Arab poets, from the tribe of Quraysh. He recited these couplets –

In summer man desires winter;



When winter comes, he desires summer.



He is never satisfied with one thing.



Let him perish! How ungrateful he is!





– before the revelation of the Koran. Later, the Koranic verse: Let man perish! How ungrateful he is! (80:17) was revealed. Imru’l-Qays eventually went to King Heraclius and was buried in Caesarea.

7 Elsewhere (Vol. 3, fol. 47a; Vol. 9, fol. 70a) Evliya attributes the tanning of animal skins and the wearing of furs to the innovation of Jamshid rather than Hushang. In the Shahnama Jamshid, son of Hushang, is a culture hero, founder of the civilized arts; and in the Book of Travels he is the patron saint of many things (see Dankoff 2004, 92).



8 This means wearing them fur-side out, as we do today – as opposed to wearing them with the furry side next to the skin, which Evliya takes to be the norm, and which was apparently the common practice among the Russians and the Tatars (the source of furs for the Ottomans), for the practical reason that they provide greater warmth that way. Elsewhere (Vol. 10, fol. 173a) Evliya asserts that Hushang Shah, the patron saint of furriers, started out wearing furs backward or fur-side out (ters geymek) – apparently because he could hunt other animals more effectively dressed in animal-like fashion; but his more sophisticated imitators began to wear them fur-side in; although fur-side out is still the fashion in the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia and Tatary.



9 Perhaps walrus ivory. There is a confusion of sülük ‘leech’ and süñük ‘bone’; see Dankoff 2008, 213, citing Vol. 7, fol. 169b on ‘the bone known as fish tooth’, one of the imports from Muscovy.

10 At this point in the description appears the phrase seraser çullar ile which might mean ‘with embroidered hair cloth bags’ (used to restrain the animals?) or else ‘dressed in hair cloth from head to foot’ (but unclear whether this would refer to the animals or their keepers).





7. Lağari Hasan Çelebi





On the sixth night after the chaste-starred daughter of Murad (IV) Khan, named Kaya Sultan, was born, in celebration of her hair being shorn, this Lağari Hasan created a rocket with seven prongs, to be fired by 50 okkas of gunpowder paste. Overlooking the sea at Sarayburnu, in the Padishah’s presence, Lağari mounted the (main) rocket and his assistants ignited it. As he was soaring to the summit of heaven, he cried out, ‘Goodbye, my Padishah. I am going to converse with Jesus.’

Offering praises to God, he ignited the rocket prongs around him, illuminating the sea below. But as he mounted to the roof of the sky, the gunpowder for the main rocket ran out and he plummeted back to earth. He had attached eagle wings to his arms in order to break the fall. Now he plunged into the sea before the palace of Sinan Pasha and swam ashore. Emerging naked, he kissed the ground before the Padishah and joked, ‘Jesus greets you, my Padishah.’

He was rewarded with a purse of gold and an appointment in the cavalry corps with a salary of 70 akçe per diem. He went on to serve Selamet Giray Khan in the Crimea, and died there. He was my close friend. May God’s mercy be upon him.





VOLUME TWO





Anatolia and beyond





EVLIYA RELATES that he always wished to travel and make the Hajj pilgrimage but found it difficult to escape family obligation; and he recalls his dream of the Prophet. Finally, on the eve of his thirtieth birthday in 1640, he departs Istanbul without informing his family and ventures to the old Ottoman capital of Bursa, famous for its hot springs (cf. those of Sofia, Volume 3, selection 8).

In August 1640, Ketenci Ömer Pasha, a protegé of his father, is appointed governor of Trabzon, and Evliya seizes the chance to set out in his retinue. One of the features of Trabzon is the fish known as hamsi (anchovy), of which he gives an amusing account. In October 1642, after many adventures, including shipwreck during a storm on the Black Sea, he returns to Istanbul. (While he claims to have witnessed the Canea campaign in 1645 – the opening salvo in the twenty-five year long Ottoman conquest of Crete – the account lacks veracity).

It is not until August 1646 that Evliya again hits the road, this time in the retinue of Defterdarzade Mehmed Pasha, a kinsman who is appointed governor of Erzurum. Once in Erzurum, Evliya accompanies an envoy to Tabriz, which marks his first excursion outside Ottoman territory. While shocked at some of the Shia religious practices and the harsh punishments meted out to criminals, he also finds things to approve of in this provincial capital of Safavid Persia. Stopping in Ardabil, he finds Divriği cats being auctioned (cf. Volume 3, selection 6). His roundabout journey in the Caucasus takes him to Baku, where he observes oil wells, and to the Armenian religious centre of Echmiadzin, as well as parts of Georgia, before returning to Erzurum.

Later Mehmed Pasha forms an alliance with Varvar Ali Pasha, the dismissed governor of Sivas who had turned rebel (‘Celali’). Eventually the rebel forces are defeated outside of Ankara, but both Mehmed Pasha and Evliya are spared. Meanwhile, Evliya learns about the manufacture of mohair, visits the shrines of saints and has an encounter with a festival of tightrope walkers – all narrated with his typical flair. Getting news of his father’s death, he returns to Istanbul in July 1648 and witnesses the events surrounding the deposal of the mad Sultan Ibrahim and the accession of the child Sultan Mehmed IV.





1. Setting out





Praise to the Creator of specks and scents, Fashioner of the pied universe, Who brought into existence this lowly slave from the realm of non-being and commanded me to obedience and service. With the Koranic injunction I created mankind and the jinn that they might worship Me (51:56), He enjoined upon His slaves the five daily prayers and the other obligations of Islam: fasting, alms, and pilgrimage.

This humble slave too wished to perform the Hajj pilgrimage and avidly desired to set out on the journey. How, I asked myself, can I get free of the pressure of parents and siblings and become a world traveller?

Then, on the first day of Muharram in the year 1040 (10 August 1630), as I aimlessly wandered the streets of Istanbul, I wrote down in Volume 1 the complete description of this matchless city, recording, as far as possible, its important buildings and noteworthy matters; all of its guilds, with their patron saints and rules and statutes, in forty-seven chapters; and the parade of the army as Gazi Sultan Murad (IV) set forth on his campaign to conquer Baghdad.

So my desire to travel and sightsee, and to visit the tombs of the saints, was satisfied within Istanbul. Still, day and night I longed to gird my loins and set out for the Holy Land, towards Baghdad and Mecca and Medina and Cairo and Damascus.

One blessed night – as I recorded at the beginning of Volume 1 – while asleep in my hovel, I dreamed that I saw the holy Prophet in person. I kissed his hand and, instead of begging him for intercession, by a slip of the tongue begged for travel instead. He raised his blessed veil, revealing his beauteous countenance, smiled, and said: ‘My intercession and my travel and my pilgrimage, may God give you health and well-being.’ He recited a Fatiha, and the entire congregation of the Prophet’s companions recited it after him. Then I kissed their hands and woke up – as I recorded above in detail.

When God desires something He prepares the intermediate causes. The following morning, by God’s wisdom, I happened to visit my old friend Okçuzade Ahmed Çelebi in the Gedikpaşa quarter. What should I see? They were making preparations for a journey to the city of Bursa. That faithful friend and dispeller of grief said, ‘Come join me, my brother Evliya. First the companion, then the road. Be my companion for five or ten days. We’ll tour Bursa with its magnificent countryside. Thus we’ll gladden our saddened spirits and scour the rust of grief from the mirror of our hearts. We’ll see thousands of noteworthy monuments and visit the tombs of hundreds of saints and Ottoman sultans. In particular, we’ll enlighten our hearts by rubbing our faces at the threshold of his holiness Emir Sultan. And we’ll have loads of fine conversation.’

At this I was lit with an inner fire, overcome with the desire to take up my loyal friend’s proposal and go to Bursa. As though overtaken by a divine inspiration I uttered a besmele and cried out to all the friends and lovers who were present, ‘May the journey be blessed, and God vouchsafe us a safe and prosperous return!’

I uttered a benediction and recited a Fatiha. Then immediately, without informing parents or siblings, I joined the party of twenty friends. We came to Eminönü and boarded a caique for Mudanya.

Account of my first journey, to Bursa, setting out in the year 1050 from my birthplace Constantinople; comprising the stages, villages and towns and noteworthy monuments, countryside and ancient cities; recording what I observed with careful attention; travelling about on the face of the earth according to the definitive Koranic texts Roam the earth (27:69, 29:20, 30:42) and Travel through them by day and night in safety (34:18); day and night viewing the sights of the seven climes in the four quarters of the world; also the hardships encountered in mountain and plain, on land and sea; and how my precious life was spent according to the dictum, Travel is a fragment of hell, though it be but a single parasang.

Setting off from Eminönü with a besmele amidst the surging waves, we struggled across the whirlpool of the Golden Horn in front of the Kurşumlu Mahzen, as it is called, located at the Galata promontory. The sea was rough at first, and we recited the Koranic verse, It is He who guides them by land and sea (10:22). It quieted down as we sailed in front of the town of Fındıklı, where we took on some passengers, expert seamen and wayfarers according to the saying, First the companion, then the road.

It was the first Friday of the month of Muharram in the year 1050 (27 April 1640). At mid-morning the burning sun stood in the sky at a height of two javelins. ‘Praise God, the winds are favourable,’ said the mariners, as they weighed anchor and raised the yard. All the sailors, after hauling up the anchor, presented themselves and hoisted sail with prayer and praise, crying ‘May God ease the journey!’ and reciting a Fatiha. With wind astern we quickly crossed the whirlpool current at Sarayburnu (the Topkapı Palace promontory) and headed in the direction of Muradiye in Bursa province. All on board were having lively discussions, and some singers in our party were intoning the hymn:

O God our Guide



Stand by our side



And hold our hand



As we cross sea and land.





It turned out that among our party were some musicians – playing the pandore, zither, reed flute and fiddle – from the retinue of Sefer Agha, Sultan Ibrahim’s chief snow procurer; also a guitar player and two singers from the retinue of Kara Recep Agha, the grand vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha’s courier. ‘Come,’ they said, ‘we’ll play you a concert in the segah musical mode which will scatter your cares in this whirlpool of grief.’ This lowly one kept the beat as we modulated through the segah and maye and gerdaniye musical modes, settling at the last of these. After two overtures we performed a sema‘i concert consisting of three quatrains composed by Dervish Ömer. It was delightful, a concert worthy of Husayn Bayqara, such as was never performed on the sea since the sea of mercy was created. Some of the mariners – Kışlakcı Dayı, Çördüm Dayı and Cıvık Veli – came with their own guitars and also played some rapturous pieces, which made the other guitar owners’ mouths water.

Proceeding in this delightful manner we stopped at Heybeli Island. It is eighteen miles from Istanbul and nine miles in circumference. It has a flourishing monastery where once a year thousands of Christians foregather, having come over from Istanbul in their caiques. They visit the grave of the monk Angilia who is buried here – the one who through his austerities took flight from Aya Sofya during Byzantine times. The people of the island are wealthy Greek ship-captains. The island has a delicious stream of water and some orchards; its administrators include a chief gardener and a janissary constable.

Departing from Heybeli we sped across the sea like lightning – it was as though flames were emerging from the prow – until five hours later, by the grace of God, we reached the shore and dropped anchor.

On the boundless sea



Are benefits galore



But for security



It’s best to stay ashore.11





11 A well-known verse from the Gulistan of Sa‘di.





2. Hot Springs of Bursa





There are a total of (—) ancient hot baths. The one with the best atmosphere and the cleanest attendants and furnishings is the Çelebi Sultan Mehmed (I) bath, beyond description. Then there are the İnebeği market bath, an endowment of Bayezid the Thunderbolt; the Tahtakale bath; the Kayağan market bath; the Gardener’s (Bostancı) bath; the Castle (Kal‘a) bath; the Knifemaker’s (Bıçakcı) bath; the Muradiye bath; (Bayezid I) the Thunderbolt bath; etc. […] These are all double baths (i.e., with separate compartments for men and women), open to all and sundry.

In addition there are 3,000 private baths in people’s houses – there are so many because water is very abundant in this city. Some people have turned their private baths into public establishments for profit, giving access from outside their house through a new door that they open up for this purpose.





Description of the natural hot springs


In Anatolia hot springs are called ılıca, in Arabia (—), in Persia germab, in Turkey kaynarca, in Bursa kaplıca, in Mongolia kerense, in Rumelia bana. They are found in many countries. According to the natural philosophers, wherever, by God’s decree, a water source comes in contact with a sulphur mine, that water boils up as though placed over a fire. It would – Heaven help us! – cook a man to death, except that cold water mixes in and moderates the hot spring. Furthermore, more benefits accrue the more one washes in it or drinks it. The ancient physicians record seventy beneficial properties. They warn, however, that drinking too much causes teeth to drop out; and that is correct, since those who take pills with sulphur or with mercury lose their teeth.

Bursa has hundreds of these hot springs. In Byzantine times the infidels were unaware of their beneficial properties and so did not build any baths here.

The Eski Kaplıca (‘Old Bath’) was built by Gazi Hudavendigar (Sultan Murad I, reg. 1362–89). In the middle of a domed space is a large pool, ten-by-ten in dimension according to Imam Zufar.12 On all sides are Hanafi basins, and there are two cubicles. It is life-restorative to anyone who enters the pool; it makes one’s skin as soft as one’s earlobes and so smooth that one’s hand slides over it like soap. The water is extremely hot by nature, but is moderated by mixing it with cold.





This is a most beneficial hot spring. Drinking the water wards off palpitations, dysentery and heart murmurs. Entering the water, however, is curative only if you know the proper procedure; otherwise it can give you pleurisy and in a single day can land you in the hospital or the graveyard. The procedure is as follows:

Go to the edge of the pool. Perform a canonical ablution. Wash your head well first with the hot water, then pour it over your body so that you become gradually accustomed to it. Now you may put your feet in the pool, immerse your entire body, and enjoy it. But you must not stay immersed for very long, and when you go out to the changing room you must not remain naked; because the body, enervated by the hot pool, is subject to a variety of illnesses when out in the cold. So you must cover yourself quickly, rest a while, let the wholesome sweat be absorbed by the bath-cloth and wiped off by towels, then put on your clothes.





If you follow this procedure you will find it life-restoring; otherwise you will renounce your own life and give heartache to others. So be very cautious in this hot spring, for however beneficial it is, it is five times more harmful.

This Hudavendigar is the most beneficial of the Bursa baths; and the outer changing room, since it is built in the old style, is not too cold.

The Bath of Çekirge Sultan is also under the protective gaze of a great saint. The building is small. The water is effective against mange and leprosy. Someone who has suffered from leprosy for forty years may be cured of that affliction by entering the water and also drinking it for forty days. His facial hair will be restored, his voice will be as loud as the prophet David’s, even his sexual prowess will return so that he can have progeny. It is known that lepers lose their brows and lashes, and their voices, and their sexual prowess. And, God save us, it is said to be a contagious disease from which one should flee as from a lion. That is the reason why in towns throughout Turkey the lepers dwell in a separate quarter, outside the city.

The Sulphur Bath is also a small building, but the water is very hot and extremely sulphurous. It is also very beneficial, especially for those who have scabies or the red itch, like the people of Banaz and Honaz. There are special bath attendants who are very knowledgeable about this disease. They rub down the scabby patient with clean bath-gloves. He then enters the cubicle and stays in the sulfurous water for half an hour, if he can bear it that long. When he comes out he puts on an old shirt which he wears for one day and night until he begins to witness the wonderful effect, fashioned by God: his scabs peel off in black scales like the skin of an onion, leaving the body shiny and smooth as pearl or silver. So beneficial is the Sulfur Bath – the more so if one drinks the water.

In short, this town of Eski Kaplıca has about 300 houses, each with orchard and garden, and each with its peculiar hot spring. Some are for men, some for women, some for children, some for youths, some for old men or old women. Each one has its special characteristic which is known to the populace of Bursa, who flock here with their families to stay for five or ten days in the homes of their acquaintances, making the rounds of the hot baths and engaging in conversation. The experts know that there are so many baths and that God has endowed each one with a special property.

Near the city, situated in a rocky gorge, is the Yeni Kaplıca (‘New Bath’). It too, like the Old Bath, is a large building completely covered with lead shingles. Originally it was small, but Sultan Süleyman visited it several times and found it curative for his gout. So he ordered his grand vizier, Sarı Rüstem Pasha, to build a large bath-house here, and Rüstem Pasha completed this New Bath in the year (—). Travellers from Samarkand and Balkh and Bukhara and Laristan and Multan agree that they have never seen such a grand and well-constructed bathhouse.

The changing room, in a spacious field, is a large domed structure, like the dome of heaven, a huge space that can accommodate 1000 men. On the wall, in large ta‘lik script, is appropriately written this verse:

Don’t put on airs with your fancy clothes.



This is the world, this is the changing room



Where everyone leaves behind his corporeal garment.





In the middle of the changing room is a pool of raw marble, and within that a jetting fountain of pure water. There are over 100 bath-attendants with their clogs, handsome and clean young men who dance attendance on their love-struck patrons.

The bathhouse itself has a pool surmounted by a large light-filled dome that some geometricians claim to be 100 cubits in circumference; an azure-coloured dome with 600 windows of glass and crystal, and overlaid with indigo-coloured leaden shingles.

The pool is ten-by-ten (cubits) in dimension, like a large island or a lake. Six marble steps lead down to it on all sides, and hot water flows into it from four directions out of the mouths of dragons and lions fashioned from raw marble.

The room known as the tepidarium (sovukluk) has a fountain with water jetting up to the dome.

The great pool is surrounded by eight vaults surmounted by a lofty dome. Beneath each vault is a Hanafi basin where those who have bathed gather to take their ablutions and to ogle the bathers swimming in the pool.

This resplendent bath is completely paved with varicoloured marble, like a goldsmith’s enamel-work.

There are two cubicles, the one on the right containing a small pool with very hot water. But there is cold water nearby, and the two are mixed to provide lukewarm water.

While this bath is not famous for its curative properties, yet it is a delightful bath of splendid construction.

In all these baths lovers dally freely with their darling boys, embracing them and going off to a corner. It is considered youthful exuberance and not improper behaviour.

During the long winter nights all the lovers flock to these baths, which they illuminate with candles. They go in the pools with their sweethearts and perform leapfrogs and somersaults. They dive below the surface and emerge to salute a pretty boy.13 They climb on one another’s shoulders, join hands, and while the ones below turn in a circle, the ‘gentlemen’ above them do all sorts of acrobatics. They leap into the water, or inflate their bath-cloths like bubbles and use them to float, or make fountains with their hands or jets with their mouths and teeth, or lie motionless on the water for an entire hour. Or all the lovers join hands and turn in a circle, raising a hue and cry like the mariners’ cry Ya mola! when they are casting off, and causing the water to swirl in waves like a whirlpool in the Arabian sea, so no one can stand but gets swept up in the flood; then they all stop at once, but the water is still swirling around them.

This kind of marvellous acrobatics is a speciality of the Bursans. People make fun of the Bursa youths who frequent these baths, saying, ‘Don’t pull, you’ll start leaking.’ This is an inside joke; for some reason the Bursans don’t like it – The meaning is in the belly of the poet.

Then there is the Kaynarca Bath, which also has curative properties. There are others as well; but being a stranger here – The stranger is like a blind man – and this being my first journey, I don’t know all their names, nor have I entered each one.

12 The Shafi‘is require a pool ten cubits by ten cubits for the canonical ablution. This contrasts with the ‘Hanafi basin’ typical of Turkish baths, a small basin with a spigot. Imam Zufar (d. 775) was an early disciple of Abu Hanifa.



13 Male preoccupation with beardless boys – ranging from Platonic affection to pederasty – was a feature of Ottoman culture. In Evliya’s usage, the dilber (translated in these pages as ‘pretty boy’, ‘darling boy’ or ‘sweetheart’) was the object of erotic attention, while the mahbub (translated as ‘lovely boy’) was more the object of aesthetic appreciation.





3. Return to Istanbul





We returned to Istanbul on the 25th of Safar in the year 1050 (16 June 1640). When I arrived at my sorrowful home, I kissed the hands of my father and mother and stood before them with hands respectfully crossed.

‘Welcome, traveller to Bursa, welcome,’ said my father. But I had thought that no one knew I was gone.

‘Sir,’ said I, ‘how did you know that I was in Bursa?’

‘On the blessed night of Ashura, the tenth of Muharram in the year 1050 (2 May 1640), the day that you disappeared, I recited several traditional prayers, and I recited We have given you (Sura 108, al-Kawthar) 1000 times. That night I dreamt that you were visiting the tomb of his holiness Emir Sultan in Bursa, seeking help from his spirituality, requesting travel, and weeping.

‘Also that night several great saints sought my permission for you to set out on your travels. By their grace I granted you permission that night, and recited a Fatiha. Come, my son, henceforth you are marked out for travel; may God bless you. But I have some advice to give you.’

He took my hand and I sat on my knees before him. With his right hand he grasped my left ear, and began to give his counsel, ‘Son,’ he said, ‘man is a miserable creature. Never eat without uttering a besmele. If you have a secret to keep, don’t tell it to your wife. Never eat while in a state of ritual impurity. Don’t sew over a tear in your garment. Don’t lend your good name to a bad end. And don’t take a bad man as your wayfellow, or you will suffer his harm.

‘Walk ahead, my dear, don’t stay behind. Don’t break ranks. Don’t tread on a field. Don’t pounce on your friend’s share. Don’t reach for something where you haven’t put it. When two people are talking, don’t listen. Pay the due of bread and salt. Don’t look on a stranger with contempt. Don’t go somewhere without an invitation. If you go, go to honourable people in a safe place.

‘Keep your confidences. Guard the words you hear in every gathering. Don’t spread evil reports from house to house. Don’t indulge in slander and backbiting. Be good-natured. Stay on good terms with everyone, and don’t be contentious or insolent. Don’t go in front of your superiors. Respect your elders. Always be clean and renounce forbidden things. Perform the five daily prayers, attend to your moral state, and busy yourself with religious knowledge. […]

‘As for this world, my son, I advise you always to be jovial and light-hearted. When you attend on viziers and deputies and other great notables, never beg for worldly goods, lest they hate you and find you burdensome. Be content with what you possess, but also don’t lavish your possessions on others. Contentment is an inexhaustible treasure, as the saying goes; it is useful in both sickness and health. Guard your worldly possessions for the sake of your own food and dress, and don’t become dependant on others. […]

‘Wherever your travels take you, bind the sash of zeal to your belt in two places. And always be on your guard, for water sleeps, but servants and strangers and enemies do not sleep.

‘Occupy yourself with visiting the graves of the great saints. Record all the shrines that you visit; also the stages of your journeys, the lowland plains and the lofty mountains, the rocks and the trees. Write down descriptions of the towns and cities, their climates and their noteworthy monuments, who built their fortifications and who conquered them, and what their dimensions are. Compose a scroll recording all these things, and call it Book of Travels.

‘May your final end be good. May you be safe from the evil of foes. May God, mighty and glorious, be your helper and aide. May you be secure in this world, vouchsafed with faith at your last breath, and gathered in the afterlife at the foot of the standard of God’s messenger. Keep this counsel of mine like an earring in your ear.’

With that he gave me a resounding slap on the back of my neck, twisted my ear, and said, ‘Go forth, may your final end be good. A Fatiha!’

I was still reeling from the force of his slap. When I opened my eyes, our house seemed to be full of light. I once again kissed my father’s hand and stood silent. Then what should I see? My father presented me with a sack containing twelve excellent books of religious guidance, including Kitab-ı Kafiya and Kitab-ı Shafiya and Monla Jami and Quduri and Multaqa and Kitab-ı Quhistani and Hidaya and Ganjina-i Raz.14 He also gave me 200 musk-scented şerifi gold pieces for road expenses.

‘Go forth,’ he said, ‘you are permitted to go in whatever direction you will; but when you are in a strange country, stand on your own two feet, be well-provided for yourself and be a friend in distress for others.’

He kissed my forehead and took me to Abdülahad Efendi in the Wednesday Bazaar, whose benediction I received; then to Sheikh Mısri Ömer Efendi and Sheikh Gafuri Efendi and Sheikh Ehl-i Cennet Efendi and Sheikh Bektashi Hasan Efendi – in short, to twelve great sheikhs, each of whose hand I kissed and each of whom imparted their spiritual support, saying, ‘Go forth, may God bless your journey!’

By the grace of God, the eye of the soul of this humble one was opened, a kind of ecstasy overcame me, and I rejoiced, returning to our humble abode. That week, the first of Rabi‘ al-awwal in the year 1050 (21 June 1640), I took passage to Izmit on the boat of our kinsman Captain Kuloğlu Mehmed. I kissed my father’s hand and set out with a besmele.

4. Hamsi in Trabzon





The favourite fish – the one they sacrifice themselves for a thousand times over and have bloody battles over when it is bought and sold – is the hapsi (or hamsi that is anchovy), dear to their hearts. It is called hamsi because it appears on the day of hamsin (Pentecost).

The reason is that during the time of Alexander the Great, a master of magic arrived and, in order to provide the monks and patriarchs with sustenance, he erected a column in the sea outside the Moloz Gate and placed on it a bronze fish, fashioned like a hamsi. On the day of Pentecost this talisman emitted a sound that made all the hamsi in the Black Sea swarm into Trabzon harbour and hurl themselves on shore.

At the birth of the Prophet Muhammad thousands of such talismans were destroyed and Nimrod’s fire-temple was extinguished. This hamsi talisman also fell into the sea, but because it is connected with the sea it has retained its efficacy to this day.

Every year, on the day of Pentecost, the hapsi fish run to shore, or else fishermen go out to catch them in caiques known as meneksile which they fill up and return. Fishmongers at the wharf cry their wares in this patter (mixture of Greek, Turkish, and nonsense):

Ey muhterun ey muhterun



Esi çağata zun



Den hurdesin samur bada taraşa



Ey lağata karun



Ehgi kolup ipsarya



Ele pamun ey umet-i Mahmet ele pamun





They also have special trumpets made of elder-tree wood. They only have to blow on these trumpets once and, by God’s dispensation, if people praying in the mosque hear it they immediately leave their prayer and come running for the hamsi. ‘Prayer is forever,’ they say, ‘but hapsi is not forever.’ Even the imams and muezzins break the ritual worship. ‘By your father’s life,’ they cry, ‘give me a handkerchief of hapsi for my little akçe,’ and they fill those delicately embroidered handkerchiefs with fish. People joke that they are sorry to see the brine dripping from the wrapping, and say: ‘Hey, you’re letting the fish juice drip out, why don’t you toss in a little pilav!’

Once a certain Çiço Husayn was having sex with his wife when he heard the trumpet announcing the catch. He immediately pulled his ‘fish’ out of his wife, tied up his drawers and ran to the wharf to buy his hapsi paluğı.15 This is a well-known story, but I never witnessed it.



Another time when the meneksile trumpet sounded, five naked men ran out of the public bath panting and sweating, jumped into a fishing-boat and filled their bath-cloths with hamsi, leaving their private parts exposed. The fisherman demanded payment, but since the men were naked and had no money on them they offered a pledge.

‘The fish-tax agent doesn’t accept pledges, only cash,’ said the fisherman.

‘Look here,’ one of them replied, ‘let these men bear witness, I offer you my religion!’

‘I too am fed up with my religion and its daily prayers,’ said the fisherman. ‘Take it, you can have mine as well!’

The town wits of Trabzon relate this sort of hapsi anecdotes, which have become proverbial among them. The Trabzon sophisticates also taunt the Çiços or simple townsfolk with verses such as:

Trabzon is our home,



Our hand can’t keep a penny.



Because of hamsi fish



We have no cares, not any.





To such a degree is this fish beloved of them.

With regard to its properties, it is first of all an elegant fish, about a span in length, rather purplish and shiny and plump. Its benefit is such that if a man eats it for seven days he will go to his wife and have his own ‘fish’ eaten seven times every night. It is very invigorating, easy to digest, has no fishy smell at all, and does not produce heat when you eat it. It is a cure for typhoid fever. If someone has snakes and scorpions in his house, he burns hapsi fish heads and fumigates the house with them, and the smell of it kills off all the vermin. This fish has hundreds of benefits and curative properties.

The Trabzonites have forty different ways of cooking hamsi, each with its own peculiar flavour, including various kinds of soup, stew with onions, kebab, stuffed pastry, and baklava.

They make a kind of stoneware pan called pileki. First they clean the fish and line them up on reeds in rows of ten each. They chop up parsley, celery, onion and leeks and mix with cinnamon and black pepper. They line the pileki pan with a layer of celery and parsley, then a layer of hapsi. Then they pour over it some Trabzon olive oil that is like the Water of Life and cook it over a hot fire for one hour. It is like congealed light, and one who eats it is light full of light. This dish benefits the eyesight and the digestion.

This fish is indeed a table from heaven (cf. 5:112), fit to be a favourite; glory be to the eternal Creator!

5. Black Sea adventure





Description of the walled town of Balıklava. While participating in so many campaigns, I had no free time to note the climate and monuments of the Crimea, including this walled town of Balıklava; so I dare not give a description of it.

In the month of (—) in the year (—), along with 350 other passengers, I boarded a şayka16 belonging to a certain Captain Ucalı Sefer. Sleeping on board that night I had some frightful dreams, and in the morning went ashore to give alms to the poor in order to ward off calamity. I reboarded and we weighed anchor. A small boat guided us out of the harbour. Because we gave no heed to whether the hour was auspicious – in accordance with the Koranic verses On a day of unremitting woe (54:19) and Over a few ill-omened days (41:16) – and made no prayers for saintly intercession, we hoisted sail with a north wind and, putting our trust in God, sailed for one day and one night with a favourable wind at our stern until we reached approximately the middle of the Black Sea. […]

The Anapa mountains to the north and the Suluyar mountains near Balıklava behind us were not visible, nor was there any sign of the Sinop and Amasra mountains in front of us. For another day and another night we were tossed about in a whirlpool of grief, the wind now before us, now behind us, not knowing in which direction we should go. In that inauspicious open sea, where neither road nor guide was evident and the sun rose in the sea and set in the sea, we sailed aimlessly, tossed about by the waves.

By God’s decree, black clouds appeared in the eastern sky. A whirlwind arose, squalls with thunder and lightning, and huge waves. All the mariners turned pale and began to rub their hands. They looked at the compass in the stern and at their mariners’ compasses, then looked at one another and began to think how to save their skins. One of them, an old salt named Dede Dayı, spoke up, ‘Avast, my hearties! What are you afeared of? God is generous. Look, a storm is brewing. Lower the topmast with the sail.’

They all jumped to and lowered the sheets and brought down the mainsail mast. But the tossing of the sea did not calm down, it only grew stronger. With the passengers assisting, the crew began to heave cargo overboard – sacks of wool, reed mats, barrels of pickled fish, ship’s timbers. The 200 captives who were aboard, young and old, were put in the hold, with the cover tightly shut. God be praised, the ship lightened a bit. Still the waves reached to the sky, the hurly-burly increased and the wind grew stronger, as in the verse:

If the boat of my heart, when we are apart,



Is tossed in a whirlpool of grief,



What can I do? The winds of time



Offer us no relief.





By God’s dispensation, the tossing of the waves began on the fourth of Safar in the year 105- (if 1051: 5 May 1641) and for three days and three nights we suffered thunder and lightning, whirlwind and tempest, rain and snow, blizzard and cyclone. The sailors could no longer stand up; each one cowered in a corner. As for the passengers, God bless them, some threw up, others threw their hands up seeking God’s forgiveness, some made sacrifices, others made vows to give alms.

‘Fellow worshippers,’ I cried, ‘let us join together in continuous recital of the Sura of Deliverance / al-Ikhlas (112) which God may be pleased to grant us.’

All those present immediately began to repeat the al-Ikhlas from the depth of their hearts. At that moment, by God’s decree, the darkness lifted, the sky became clear, the thunder and lightning ceased.

The tossing of the sea, however, did not abate. The huge wave known in those coasts as the Seventh Wave (yedişerleme) gave no quarter. Now it rose to the zenith, the ship’s mast touching the clouds; now it sank to the bottom of the sea, as though to the depths of hell, and the Black Sea loomed up all around us like Mt Bisutun.

Eventually we opened the cover of the hold and heaved all the heavy merchandise overboard, but still we found no relief. The next thing we saw was that the rudder bolt broke in the ship’s stern and the rudder flew overboard. All the mariners struck their knees with their hands and huddling together began to make amends with one another as though on their death beds.

At this point those sailors who were spirited and courageous grabbed axes and cut the sheets, then all together began chopping at the mast. At once the mast snapped and fell into the sea, crushing eleven men to death. We tossed the corpses overboard. Weeping and wailing arose as everyone despaired of life and thought about how to save his skin.

Now another squall struck and tore the ship in two. The passengers and prisoners in the hold all rushed out in a panic. Some made amends, asking one another to forgive their debts. Some of the crew began to strip their clothes off. Everyone tried to find a plank, a gourd or cask or barrel, anything to hold onto.

As for this lowly one, I too was overcome. I continuously recited Ya Sin (Sura 36), giving no thought to my slaves and goods and provisions, but entrusting my affairs to the Lord of glory from the depth of my heart, and occupying myself with reciting the Witness formula and the Koranic verses To God I commend myself (40:44) and He that fears God, God will give him a means of salvation and will provide for him whence he does not reckon (65:2–3).

I noticed that some infidels had brought down the launch by its rope and scrambled into it. On the other side of the ship the other mariners hurled themselves into the sea holding planks, or the like. I and my seven companions drew our swords and leapt into the launch, just as the infidels already there were cutting the rope. Two of them drew their swords against us. Şerif Ramazan Çelebi from Ayntab was struck in the chest above the nipple. The seven of us attacked the eight of them and killed four, while the other four, fearing for their lives, hurled themselves into the sea. So the launch was left to us seven companions. We threw overboard any heavy baggage, and the boat tossed in the waves, lightened of its load.

Meanwhile the ship had been split asunder from stem to stern. The 300 passengers and merchants and the roughly 400 slaves and seamen leapt into the water with a cry of ‘Allah!’ Some drowned, others kept afloat on planks or other props, struggling with no cash to make a purchase in the bazaar of life. Some, swimming for their lives, swarmed our lifeboat. Among these was the story-reciter Emir Çelebi. I grabbed him by the arm and hauled him into the boat. As others too tried to climb in we realised that our launch was bound to capsize with so many people. So the seven of us again drew our swords and fended them off.

As we got our distance from the shattered ship it disappeared from sight, and eventually there was no one else visible. We tried to recover our wits, as the boat oscillated between the tip of heaven and the depth of the sea. We used our turbans to bail out the boat. We were exhausted from this activity and from the rough weather.

What should we see? There was the kadi of Menkup, Ali Efendi, diving through the waves like a heron, making his way toward us. With God’s help we got Ali Efendi aboard. So now we were ten people in the lifeboat. We kept on bailing water and reciting Ya Sin, but all of us despaired of our lives.

We spent one day and one night in this manner, tossing on the sea and shaking like leaves in autumn, hungry and miserable and weeping and naked. The kadi Ali Efendi and the story-reciter Emir Çelebi succumbed to pleurisy and died. Saying it was God’s decree we threw their corpses overboard and the eight of us were left in the boat as before. A large pinewood plank, twenty cubits long and one cubit wide, kept harrying us, now battering the boat, now drifting apart. Saying ‘What can we do? It is God’s to command,’ we kept bailing and were dizzy from the cold and exhaustion.

At noon on the third day, by God’s decree – and according to the verse,

Through cautionary measures



You can’t thwart destiny;



Though you be a thousand times cautious,



Still what will be will be.





– a huge wave came and turned the boat upside-down. This humble one too was plunged headlong into the sea. Fearing for my life I struggled in the water, thrashing with my hands and arms – because I did have some skill in swimming. I emitted a heart-burning sigh to the Lord of truth. From the depth of my heart I held to the noble Koran as my intercessor, and inwardly sought succour from the spiritual qualities of the great saints whose graves I had visited.

The Lord of Glory fashioned a fire in my heart. The mirror of my heart was polished. From the depth of my heart I concentrated on the declaration of God’s unity, and took great consolation. I recalled the mystics in the countries where I had travelled. I was free of fear and my wits were restored.

Apparently that mighty and eternal One, the Sustainer who is forever, desired to rescue this sinful slave. As I was swimming fearlessly and furiously, like a diver, suddenly that long and broad plank – the one I mentioned above that kept battering our boat – heaved into view. I quickened my stroke, thinking that I should try to grab onto that plank rather than drown in this black and merciless sea. Saying ‘Come what may’ and performing death-defying feats in this life-and-death bazaar, I slithered onto the plank like a snake and grasped it tight. It was like encountering his holiness Hızır, the saviour of seamen.

I had no idea what became of my companions in the boat. But as I was bobbing up and down in the waves, shivering with cold and fear, I heard a cry behind me. Looking back, and afraid for my life, I saw there were several other people clinging like bats to the selfsame plank that I was riding. There were two Georgian slaveboys, two Circassian girls, and one Russian slave.

‘Oh dear,’ thought I, ‘these people will be a heavy weight on my plank and will cause me to drown. Oh what is my sad fate? What can I do, I wonder, to lighten the load and have this plank all to myself?’

By God’s wisdom, a water barrel was floating by like a gourd. The Russian boy heaved himself off our plank and onto the barrel, but was unable to get his arms around it and – as though one should say, ‘Haul up the guest!’ – the poor lad drowned. That left the other four captives to contend with. Murmuring ‘God is generous,’ I did nothing.

We were in the middle of the sea with no coast in sight. But, praise God, the weather calmed a bit. The sun shone and warmed us up. The tossing of the sea died down. An east wind sprang up and drove us forward. God be praised, on the third day some lofty mountains came into view, and at noon the waves drove us ashore. I fell onto the sand utterly exhausted, recalling the verse:

On the boundless sea



Are benefits galore



But for security



It’s best to stay ashore.





Gathering my strength, I gave a hundred thousand praises to the Lord Creator. Consider that Lord of generosity, Who bestowed on me eighteen slaves in Mingrelia and Abkhazia and Crimea, then took them away. When I despaired of life in the merciless sea he again gave me four captives, lovely boys and girls, each of them one in a thousand.

As we were sheltering on the shore at the foot of the cliffs, some Muslims came and seeing us in this state removed their overgarments and draped them over this humble one and my slaves. I questioned them as they conducted us to the top of the cliffs. It turned out that these tall cliffs and orchards were part of the Keligra Sultan mountains which came down to the Black Sea in the province of Silistria (Kaliakra in Bulgaria).

The upshot of this adventure is that from the time the ship capsized we wandered in our lifeboat, hungry and miserable, for three days and three nights; and when the lifeboat capsized we clung to the plank for a fourth day and night until, on the fifth day at noon we came ashore and found salvation, like Noah the Saved, at the foot of the cliffs of Keligra Sultan. We were cheered up by the dervishes at the shrine of Keligra Sultan, where they assigned a room to me along with my slaves whom God had bestown on me.

I was in a delirium for the first ten nights in this convent. Various illnesses had taken root in our veins from the exposure and the terrible suffering we had undergone in the storm. I spent an entire winter here, crestfallen and weeping on my pillow, and completed ten entire Koran-recitations of gratitude. In this place I calculated that I had completed a total of 1,060 Koran-recitations since my childhood.

So I spent eight months recovering my health in this shrine of Keligra Sultan, having delightful conversations with the Bektashi dervishes, sometimes serving them as imam or muezzin. During this time not one of my slaves said that they belonged to anyone else, but all acted as though I were their legitimate owner.

[…]





(Legends of Keligra Sultan, i.e. Sarı Saltık)


This shrine of Keligra Sultan, where we were hosted after being delivered from the sea, is a lofty promontory that projects into the Black Sea like an elephant’s trunk. Ships from Istanbul going toward Kara Hırmen and Köstence and Kili take a bead on these Keligra cliffs, which rise up toward the sky and are visible from 150 miles away. Directly across the sea in an eastward direction in Anatolia is the Sinop Promontory, the distance between that and the Keligra cliffs being (—) miles. In very clear weather the mountains of Sinop are visible from Keligra, and the mountains of Keligra are visible from Sinop. At the very tip of the Keligra Promontory is a cave where Keligra Saltık Sultan is buried – that is where the dragon was stopped.17

The shrine itself is a large convent, founded by Dobruca Ali Muhtar. The saint’s wooden sword and sling, tambourine and drum, standards and banners are kept within. There are a variety of rooms, and a summer plaza and winter plaza furnished all around with immaculate sheepskins. On each sheepskin sits a spiritual master, excelling in knowledge and virtue. All are strict Sunnis, believers and monotheists, who perform the five daily prayers in their mosque. There are over 100 mystical lovers. Indeed, during my eight-month stay they studied Koran-recital with me according to the reading of Hafs.18

The windows of this convent, and of the light-filled tomb, all face the sea. The kitchen of Kay Kavus is marvellous to behold. It has a suspended dome-shaped chimney. Cauldrons are over the fire continuously day and night, and food is dispensed freely to all comers and goers. The dervishes own no buildings or estates; their income is wholly derived from begging. The cooks have assistants, barefoot and bare-headed devotees, lively and stalwart fellows who burn with divine love and mystical devotion. Such a great convent it is.

To the left and right of the convent, at the top of the cliffs, are hundreds of well-mouths. The rock cliffs rise perpendicularly, like Mt Bisutun, but the bases are hollowed out, forming natural harbours. Ships with top-gallant masts a hundred cubits tall enter below the overarching cliffs and drop anchor. The ship captains buy wheat and barley from the peasants which they transport by cart and pour into the well-mouths at the top of the cliffs. The grain falls down the shafts into the holds of the ships waiting below until they are full. These shafts were excavated in ancient times by the infidels, digging like Farhad, in such a way that ships can dock next to them. It is a marvellous sight, peculiar to this region. For it is impossible to bring wheat and barley and other goods down to the ships in sacks; that would require men on foot to scramble like goats up and down the mountain paths, which are three or four hours away from the cliffs and harbours.

In the entire perimeter of the Black Sea, this is the only place with such lofty cliffs. The southwesterly gale and the south and east storm winds batter these rocks with a thunderous roar that can be heard in Aflatar and Alhanlar near Silistra, a full day’s journey away (about twenty miles). So lofty are these mountains, reaching up to the Milky Way. The cliffs house nests of peregrine and other falcons, also musky eagles the size of sheep. Some men in the convent make sacrifices and feed them to the eagles. If the eagles eat the sacrifice, the men’s wishes are granted, if not, not. At least that is what people say.

With regard to this Keligra Sultan, there are hundreds of legends, but I have given an abbreviated account.

Near the convent is the castle of Keligra Sultan which was built by King Yanvan, brother of Yanko ibn Madyan and author of the history of the Greeks.19 It was conquered from the Byzantines in the year (—) by Musa Çelebi, son of Sultan Bayezid the Thunderbolt. Administratively it belongs to the kadi-district of Balçık in the province of Özü. It is a small square castle 1,000 paces in circumference, located on the seashore; a towering fortress, as though built by Shaddad. There is a single gate, facing west. Inside there are no houses, no mosque or han or shops, no warden or garrison or arsenal. On the eastern side are rock crevices a hundred fathoms deep. The lower part of this castle is also hollow, since it is situated on top of the Keligra Sultan cliffs.

In the year (—), when Nasıf Paşazade Hüseyn Pasha was governor of Özü province, the ill-omened Ukrainians who are the Cossacks of Özü raided these coasts several times and enslaved the populace. Hüseyn Pasha repaired this Keligra castle with his own money and put in a warden and garrison, so when the cussed Cossacks raided, the people took refuge in the castle and were safe from harm. It is a very strong castle. Afterwards grand vizier Mustafa Pasha removed the garrison back to Özü, in spite of Hüseyn Pasha, and the castle was left vacant.

God be praised, after suffering the vicissitudes of the sea I was rescued before the bird of my soul flew from the cage of my body and spent eight months in this convent of Keligra Sultan having delightful conversations with all the dervishes and seeing all sorts of sights.

In the spring, the month of (—) in the year 1050 (if error for 1052: 1642), I bade farewell to all my friends and acquaintances, made a farewell visit to the tomb of Keligra Sultan, seeking succour from his noble spirit, and boarded a caique with my four slaveboys. We hopped from harbour to harbour along the Black Sea coast, drawing the caique ashore by cables in stormy weather to be safe from the tossing of the sea. We docked at Kavarna, Balçık, Varna, Ahyolı, Suzebolu, Müsevre, Burkas, Çingene, etc. … Terkoz … Karataşlar. …



With a besmele we entered the Bosphorus in the month of (—) in the year (—) and dropped anchor at Kavak where I disembarked, made a prostration of thanksgiving and a sacrifice of gratitude for God’s mercy, and distributed the meat to the poor. God be praised, although we suffered the tortures of purgatory in this journey, still we accomplished many travels and jihads and managed to tour the entire perimeter of the Black Sea.





(Description of the Black Sea)


This lowly sinner travelled the perimeter of the Black Sea and returned to Istanbul through the Bosphorus on the first day of Sha‘ban, 105- (if 1052: 25 October 1642). I immediately proceeded to his holiness Abu Ayyub Ansari,20 rubbed my face at his felicitous threshold, started a complete Koran recital on behalf of his noble spirit and made a sacrifice in the path of God. I then came home to my father and mother who pressed me to their bosoms.

At this time I made a solemn vow never again to set out by ship on the Black Sea. May God Most High keep all the community of Muhammad from harm; amen, O Helper!

Then, in Ramadan of (10)5– (if 1052: November–December 1642) I became imam to the customs inspector Ali Agha. Our nights were like the Night of Power, our days like the Day of Festival.21 We had intimate conversations with all the sweethearts, and accumulated substantial gifts and emoluments. Thus did the Lord Creator compensate us for our property that was lost in the Black Sea, and for our nineteen slaves who were drowned.

21 The Night of Power (27 Ramadan) is celebrated as the night on which the Koran was revealed. The festival days are the two eids or Bayrams, the Festival of Sacrifice at the end of the Hajj pilgrimage season, and the Breakfast Festival at the end of Ramadan.





6. Tabriz





I received gifts from the governor of this city (Marand) and set out together with the ambassador of the governor of Tabriz, travelling south in the midst of countryside for thirteen hours. Both sides of the highway were lined with weeping willows and verdant and lofty plane trees, leaving no opening for the sun to strike. So we proceeded in complete shade as under an arbour, occasionally stopping to rest and drink from the purling streams, until we arrived at Kahriz.

This is a village of 1,000 houses belonging, they said, to the Tabriz governor’s secretary. It has six mosques, three public baths and two hans. A flourishing village with orchards and gardens beyond number – may God the Avenger destroy it! Because all the inhabitants are Shi‘is and caliph-cursers. This was the first time in Persia that I heard them – God forbid! – cursing the Caliph Umar. I nearly went out of my mind. But I was weak and tired, not yet in a position to do anything about it. Otherwise I could easily have killed that accursed curser; because when Ottoman envoys come to Persia they have the liberty of killing up to four Kızılbaş cursers for the sake of the Four Companions of the Prophet, no questions asked. For now I bore it patiently.

Seven hours south of Kahriz we came to the village of Sahlan, a royal has belonging to the governor of Tabriz. Situated in a level plain, it has 1,000 houses, orchards and gardens, seven mosques, a han and a public bath, and some small royal shops. It is a fine village, with weeping willows and plane trees lining the main road, and pleasure-pavilions in the orchards and gardens. The people, however, are again those damned Rafidis (i.e., Shi‘is), although they pretend to be Shafi‘is (i.e., Sunnis). But the climate and the lovely boys and girls are highly reputed.

As we set out from Sahlan we could make out the domed tomb of Sham-ı Ghazan Muhammad Shah looming up on our right side, six hours away.22 I recited a Fatiha for his spirit. We stopped to rest in a meadow and sent a man ahead to Tabriz. Three hours later we put on our armour and mounted, with my horse and that of the Tabriz envoy head to head. In front of the envoy marched his soldiers, with their magnificent garments, and in front of me forty horsemen composing my train, while a large contingent approached us from the other direction.

This, it turned out, was the deputy of the governor of Tabriz who had come out to meet us. We proceeded together, stirrup to stirrup, in grand procession, entering the city of Tabriz nine hours after leaving Sehlan. It was the (—) of the month of (—). Thousands of people turned out in the marketplace to see the sight, and I did my own sightseeing of them. It took two hours to go from the edge of the city to the governor’s palace. The noble khan or governor, Kelp Ali Khan, came out to greet us.23

We took our places in the audience hall, sitting knee to knee. Three times they sounded the imperial kettledrums and the horns of Afrasiyab24 and the trumpets and shawms of Jamshid. With great pomp and ceremony they presented us with fine silken stuffs, as row on row of pageboys stood in attendance with hands folded, fully armed, with plumes in their Safavid turbans.

After the drumroll I stood up and removed from my breast the jewel-studded and love-styled letter of our lord and vizier, the governor of Erzurum, Defterdarzade Mehmed Pasha. I kissed it and gave it to the Khan, hand to hand. He too rose to his feet, took it in his hand, kissed it and put it on his head. The master of ceremonies indicated that I should resume my place, but as the Khan remained standing so did I, following Muhammadan protocol. The Khan gave the letter to his secretary who kissed it reverentially and read it out loud. At mention of the Prophet and the Four Companions all present in the council rose to their feet and magnified the name of the Prophet, but at the names of the Four Companions some of them immediately sat down.

After the letter was read, and its contents understood, the Khan said, ‘God willing, with the help of the Lord and Nourisher of mankind, within this month I will send out a caravan of 1,000 camels. Upon my head and eye!’

‘Welcome,’ he continued, addressing me. ‘A hundred welcomes. Your step is auspicious, delight of my life and light of my eyes!’ He went on in this vein with polite talk and light-hearted conversation as we sat knee to knee. With hand on breast he arranged a huge feast, followed by incense and rose-water.



From the Pasha’s gifts I picked out a set of pearl prayer-beads, a gold-embroidered silken quiver, and some Genoese and Venetian moiré stuffs.25

‘The noble pasha your brother greets you,’ I said, ‘and sends these tokens of his love to your majesty so that you will not go empty-handed.’ He was very pleased with the prayer-beads and the quiver of arrows.

‘And he sends two thoroughbred horses, swift as the wind, for your felicitous attention.’ With this I stood up, came to the edge of the audience hall and made a signal.

First they brought forward the horse with jewelled saddle and jewel-encrusted bridle. Praise God, when that piebald and rose-bodied Arabian cantered into the plaza, whinnying and prancing, all the Persian courtiers put finger to mouth in astonishment. With a besmele I handed over the reins to the Khan saying ‘May it be a blessing!’ He jumped with joy, mounted the Arab steed without a stirrup, cantered about the plaza a few times like a knight in the field of eloquence, and dismounted.

Then they brought the caparisoned horse. The Khan was immensely pleased at that one too, and gave it over to his (—).

Following this the Khan gave orders to his sons and servants, who brought rice-water sherbet and, once again, rose-water and incense. He then entrusted us to the care of his hospitality officer and chief of the guards and prefect and mayor who conducted us in procession to the mayor’s world-adorning garden where we were housed. At our heels came tumans of bisti coins as bath-money, one Karaçubuk (‘Black Rod’) thoroughbred with saddle and bridle, one piebald sorrel ambler, and seven camel-loads of food and drink and fruit. Our house overflowed with these gifts.

Cryers circulated throughout the city with the announcement, ‘As long as the Ottoman Sunni envoys are here, it is the royal proclamation of the governor that you will not engage in ritual cursing. If you do, the Sunnis may shed your blood without recrimination. Be advised!’

God be praised, cursing of the Four Companions of the Prophet ceased. To be sure, they do not curse Abu Bakr and Uthman; their main concern is Umar, upon whom – God help us! – they continually vent their spleen.

That same day the Khan sent us ten pages, prancing like peacocks and smothered in chintz and silk brocades. Our host Hoca Sirac brought them to us and they kissed my hand. Apparently it is the kanun of Persia for the governors to send each of the Ottoman envoys ten boys who are ordered to obey their every command. The ones who showed up were named Jivan-aramish, Sadiq Jan, Ramish, Mirza Khan, Yazdan Ali, Kakunj, Qurban Bay, Suhrab, Mazid Khan, and Yar Quli. They were choice and splendid youths, congealed light, like so many denizens of paradise.

Finally we began to tour the city.

[…]

One of the sights is the polo grounds. In the middle of an open field are two lofty columns of juniper wood nailed together, at the apex of which a silver bowl has been affixed. On Fridays the servants of the Shah and of the Khan mount their wind-swift steeds and do sports, one of which is to shoot arrows at this bowl, as the love-struck spectators look on. On the Khwarazm-shah’s New Year’s Day in particular they stage a battle between horses that have been reared in darkened quarters for forty or fifty days. It is a great spectacle. They also have combats between camels, buffaloes, rams, donkeys, and dogs, as well as cockfights. These New Year’s entertainments are peculiar to Persia.

Another marvellous and noteworthy spectacle is the Ashura ceremony held every year on the tenth day of Muharram. All the notables and citizens, young and old, come out to these polo grounds where they pitch their tents and stay for three days and three nights. They boil innumerable cauldrons of Ashura pudding, in remembrance of the martyrs in the plain of Karbala, and distribute it among rich and poor alike, devoting the religious merit accrued thereby to those martyrs’ spirits.

And water carriers dispense cold water and sweet sherbets, poured from their waterskins into bowls of glass or crystal, even agate or turquoise. The thirsty spectators drink these beverages in remembrance of the martyrs who suffered thirst in the plain of Yazid on the day of Ashura, intoning the verse:

For the love of Husayn of Karbala, to health!





Or they cite the Koranic verses Their Lord will give them pure nectar to drink (76:21), and as lawfully yours (4:4). Several of the great notables, setting aside their dignity on this day, hang a waterskin on their neck and dispense water for the sake of the spirit of Husayn.

The great event of the day is when the Khan pitches his parti-coloured pavilion in this open field and all the Tabriz notables gather round knee to knee to hear the recital of ‘The Martyrdom of Husayn’ which is comparable to the recital of ‘The Birthday of the Prophet’ in Turkey. All the lovers of the Prophet’s family listen with dejection and humility, moaning and sighing. Finally, at the words, ‘The accursed Shibr, the oppressor, martyred his holiness Imam Husayn, the oppressed, in this fashion,’ a curtain opens behind the reciter and a severed head and trunk of a body, with blood flowing, are thrown in front of the Khan’s pavilion. Then they bring mannequins of the Imam’s innocent children, who died of thirst. The audience wail and lament and are caught up in a woeful ecstasy.

At this juncture some hundreds of professional barbers circulate among the lovers with razors in their hands. Those wishing to demonstrate their love for Husayn on that day have the barbers slash their arms and breasts, shedding so much blood that the verdant green ground turns tulip red. Some of the lovers brand their heads with the Mark of Submission, or brand their arms with the marks of Hasan and Husayn and Aqil, or have tattoos pricked on their arms, shedding their blood for the love of Husayn.

Eventually they remove the dummy bodies, complete ‘The Martyrdom of Husayn’ amidst weeping and litanies, eat up the Ashura puddings, and enjoy spiritual intercourse for three days and three nights. What a grand spectacle!

Due to the delightful climate, the orchards and rose-gardens here are beyond number. The entire city is like the garden of the many-columned city of Iram (89:7) and the parks and picnic places are like the gardens of Meram (in Konya), Aspuzu (in Malatya) and Sudak (in Crimea). The Persian-style pavilions of Shirin and courtyards of Vamık and Azra (lovers celebrated in poetry) are bywords of beauty. One of them is the pavilion in the mayor’s garden where we were housed; it has the following chronogram in the calligraphy of Qutb al-Din Muhammad Yazdi:

O place of Shirin, lofty arch.



Year 982 (1574–5)





There are many other such noteworthy monuments, but there is no profit in enumerating those that are obscure or not worth dwelling upon, and the prolongation of discourse gives rise to tedium, so this much will suffice.

God be praised, we spent two full months enjoying the pleasures of Tabriz and contemplating the youths of Azerbaijan. We also went off on a junket with the noble Khan and a retinue of 1,000 soldiers to visit the surrounding towns and villages. We went as a hunting party, with hawking drums beating, and accompanied by hawks and hounds. We toured villages in the flourishing districts of Mihranrud … Saravrud … Didahar … Urdniq … Rudkat … Khanumrud … and Badustan….

If I were to record the hunts and other delights of these villages, to the extent of my experience, over the twenty days of our expedition, God knows, it would require an entire volume. Because in the entire kingdom of Persia there is no city and no countryside as fine as Tabriz, the ravisher of hearts, and Isfahan, known as half the world. It is a large and ancient city with delightful climate, lovely boys and girls, lofty buildings and numerous foundations and institutions. May God vouchsafe that it once again belong to the Ottomans27 – although that would bring about its ruin; may God Most High cause it to flourish forever!

Returning to the city I once again was honoured with the company of the Khan and had intimate converse with him on a daily basis.

One day, in the course of one of these conversations, the Khan offered me some wine.

‘I swear by God,’ said I, ‘and by the pure spirit of Ali, that from the time I was born to this day I have never tasted any forbidden food or intoxicating beverage or aphrodisiac substance or mind-altering drug. From the time of my great ancestor, Turk of the Turks, Hoca Ahmed Yesevi ibn Muhammed Mehdi,28 none of my forbears has drunk wine or taken narcotics or stimulants. Please excuse me in this privy council of yours.’

‘My brother, light of my eye and delight of my heart!’ he said. ‘I beg you. My own Mirza Shah is standing before you and offering a cup of pure wine. If you do not quaff a cup of ruby wine for his sake, from whose hand will you take a goblet? Who are you afraid of? Is it your shah, the Caesar in Constantinople? He is a five months journey away. Is it your khan in Erzurum? That is a forty-stage journey from Tabriz. So who is it that you fear? I who am Kelp Ali Khan – khan of khans of the Shah of Persia and Turan – I do not forbid it. I do not follow the edict of my beautiful Shah who said that he would tear out the gall of any of his governors who were caught drinking wine. No, I break his edict and, covertly, have drinking parties with wine and music and entertainment. So who are you afraid of? You must drink!’

‘My handsome Khan,’ I replied. ‘If your beautiful shah has forbidden you to drink wine, the Shah of Shahs, the Padishah Whose edict one does not question, has forbidden me a single drop, in the definitive text: Wine and gamefning arrows, are abominations devised by Satan (5:90). It is God the Avenger that I am afraid of, He who brought all things into existence out of non-being. I will not break His command and will not drink wine.’

‘By God, you are a fine believer and fanatic.’

‘By God, my Khan, I am not a fanatic, only a pure adherent of the school of Nu‘man ibn Thabit (i.e., a Hanafi). Otherwise I am a world traveller and boon-companion to mankind, a lover of the family of the Prophet, and a man of God.’

This put all the courtiers and boon-companions in a stupor and a quandary. The insistent khan stood up with all his darling boys and came over to me, saying, ‘Come, light of my eye. I beg you, my Evliya Agha, take one of these slaveboys of mine. Which one do you fancy? Yazdan Shir? Mirza Shah? Firuz? Parviz? Ali Yar? Zulyazan? Shahlavand? Sayf Quli? Khal Khan? I’ll give him to you. If you love ‘Red’ Murtaza Ali and the Twelve Imams, come, my believer, quaff a cup of wine from the hand of one of these boys, that heads may grow warm and breasts grow soft, that we may get a bit of pleasure and a moment of gratification in this banquet-hall of evanescence.’

All his slaveboys – radiant as congealed light – embraced me and started kissing me. And I kissed them back. Still I sought the assistance of the Munificent, the Absolute.

‘My Khan,’ I said, ‘is this what you call an intimate gathering, when now Hoca Naghdi has knocked off a cup of wine, and is drunk, and belches and farts in your presence? Is this what passes in Persia as having a party and living it up?’

At this the Khan began kicking Hoca Naghdi and knocking him on the head, getting him on his feet. But Hoca Naghdi was so drunk that he seemed to be intoning the verse:

I am so drunk I do not know



What is worldly or divine.



Who am I? Who is the cupbearer?



What is the crimson wine?





I saw that the Khan was still going to insist that I drink. Realising that the council chamber is a place of security, I said, ‘My Khan, you drink wine and get heated and intoxicated. But divine intoxication is what we need. Have them bring me a tambourine and I’ll show you what divine intoxication is.’

‘Yar Ali!’ he cried, ‘For the love of Ali, bring my brother a tambourine.’ Yar Ali brought me one with Indian inlay-work on the hoop and a pinewood cymbal. Taking it from his hand, I began to improvise in the Turkish manner, in the segah mode, singing:

My love for you betokens



Eternal life.



Each love-struck one on your behalf



Gives up his life.





I sang three quatrains and one sema‘i, and finished the session with a two-couplet piece. All those present put finger to mouth in astonishment. The khan rewarded me in the Persian manner, draping a sable fur-piece over my shoulders with his own hand.

‘A thousand bravoes!’ he cried. ‘A million blessings on you, O impudent one of the land of Caesar!’ He showered me with presents, including a Georgian slaveboy; ten tumans of abbasi coins; and a ‘Black Rod’ horse, swift as the wind. Now he was safe from me, and he stopped offering me wine.

We spent an entire month in this fashion, engaged in intimate converse with the Khan, or else seeing the sights of heart-ravishing Tabriz. So our nights were like the Night of Power, and our days like the holiday of the Festival of Sacrifice.

But let me express my boundless admiration for the justice of his administration, the safety and security of the city, his fostering care for his subjects, the law and order, the cleanliness of the marketplaces, the schedule of fixed prices of Sheikh Safi,29 and the prevailing orderliness. To be sure, the people are all pleasure-seekers and party-goers. But one never sees anyone intoxicated on the public thoroughfare. Everyone is extremely well-behaved, befitting these eloquent verses:

Devoted to their pleasure, the people of Tabriz



Are like a mirror, free of the rust of cruelty.



And if you say they are not faithful to their friends,



The mirror can reflect but what it apprehends.





To sum up the praisworthy customs of Tabriz:


1) They sweep the public thoroughfares day and night with brooms, then sprinkle them with sparkling water – something they can do because of the many streams flowing through the city – leaving not a speck of dust. So even in July the marketplaces are clean and cool. One who goes there is refreshed, and one who looks at the faces of the youthful shopkeepers is astonished.

2) They never marry off girls of the noble family of Muhammad to slaves or converts, but rather they observe the principle of social equality in marriage. When I questioned them about this they replied, ‘You marry non-Muslim women, arguing that the man plants the seed, and he is Muslim. This is a reasonable legal doctrine. But you do not marry off girls observing the principle of social equality. If you marry a girl to a man who has converted to Islam, it is possible that he will apostatise. Since the man plants the seed, what about the children? Perhaps that convert will abandon them and run off to the infidels. Then we could not consider the children to be descendants of the Prophet through their mother, since according to your doctrine the man plants the seed. Based on this you marry non-Muslim women; but in that case what happens to the children of an apostate and a woman descended from the Prophet?’

‘The Lord Creator,’ I said, ‘causes all children – no matter what religious community they are born in, whether Jewish or Christian – to be born Muslim; then they are led astray by the teaching of their parents.’ And I cited the Hadith, The messenger of God, May God bless him and give him peace, said: There is no one born except in the natural state of Islam; then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.

‘The messenger of God speaks truth,’ I said. When they heard this noble Hadith they fell silent.

3) It is the kanun of Sheikh Safi that all commerce in the royal bazaars be conducted with bisti and abbasi coins and with gold. Coins of other kingdoms are not allowed, only Safavid coins have currency. They are minted in seven places, marked as ‘struck’ in Ardabil, Hamadan, Baghdad, Isfahan, Tiflis, Nihavand, or Tabriz. The inscription on one side is: There is no god but God; Muhammad is the messenger of God; Ali is the friend of God. On the reverse is the name of the regnant shah, as Unworthy slave, dog of Ali, Shah Abbas. Only the kazbeki – this is the name given to the copper coin – is marked ‘Struck in Tiflis’ or ‘Struck in Tabriz’ and on the other side is the year of mintage. These are the only coins in circulation.

All their measures of length have There is no god but God written on one end. The same for measures of volume, as well as finely sewn fabrics. The drams and scales are also marked with the Name of Glory (i.e., Allah). Woe to him who commits a fraud while using weights and measures with There is no god but God – he will be punished by inserting a stylus in his eye and putting a burning plate on his head.

All the royal markets and the small shops have scales suspended by brass or iron chains. They are permanently suspended, never touched by human hands. When a customer wants something – food or drink or fruits and vegetables – he selects what he prefers and places it in the pan of the scales, then gives the shopkeeper the price corresponding to the weight; because his akçe is pure (i.e., the coin is unadulterated) and he has purchased what he himself selects.

Furthermore, all foodstuffs in the marketplace – whether bread, meat, vegetables, barley, wheat, flour, chickens, pigeons, walnuts, hazelnuts, or any prepared foods sold in the cook-shops – are sold by weight according to the schedule of fixed prices of Sheikh Safi. Wheat, rice and other grains are always sold by weight, not by volume. Woe to that man who commits a fraud while using dram weights with There is no god – he will have his gall bladder drawn out from under his armpit; that is the Persian kanun.

Cloth goods and fabrics are sold by the royal cubit. Animals and slaves also are sold at prices determined by the law of Safi and transactions are supervised by professional assayers. The royal kanuns prevail.

4) The cookshop keepers in all the royal markets cannot open their shops until they have washed the china dishes hanging on the wall and the copper utensils and the cups and the porcelain and celadon bowls that they use to serve the food. They open their shops at dawn, uttering a prayer, and serve out – after weighing them on scales – portions of pilavs, whether with boiled wheat, roasted meat, omelette, boiled rice, saffron or rice-water. These are the favourite dishes.

The waiters are clean and lovely youths. They serve the food on pewter dishes with inscriptions in ta‘lik lettering such as They give sustenance (76:8) or aphorisms such as There is no nobility loftier than Islam or The nobility of a place depends upon the one who occupies it or The nobility of a house depends upon its inhabitants and the nobility of its inhabitants depends upon their generosity. After dining, notables of the town are given napkins and clean bowls and ewers to wash their hands; but servant types and hangers-on wipe their right hand under their left armpit and their left hand under their right armpit or under the right skirt of their robe and take off like dogs in a field. That is the way things are.





As for the condemnable customs of the Persians:


1) It is the ancient kanun of Azerbaijan that only certain groups cook food in their houses. These include the twelve military regiments – for love of the Twelve Imams – consisting of several thousand men; also twelve groups each of the ulema and of the other notables. The rest are not permitted to light fires in their chambers, except in order to make coffee or tea or fennel or salep or mahaleb, and in order to heat water to wash their clothes. So all the retinue types and soldiers and bachelors get their food in the marketplace. This is why they are ‘bad-living’ (bed-ma‘aş) Kızılbaş, since their living (ma‘işet) is in this respect really bad, although it is cheap. You can get anything to eat that you want, and for bachelors and people on payrolls this is convenient.

Indeed, if a soldier takes his meals in the bazaar for three months, when the royal clothing allotment comes up, the cook goes to the divan and says, ‘I am Kurban Kuli’s cook,’ and takes away Kurban Kuli’s clothing. But he cannot take any item more or less than allotted; if he does, he will have his tongue pulled out through the back of his neck. After this the cook feasts the owner of the clothing gratis for twelve days. That is the kanun.

When the Shah or his general goes on campaign, the largest contingent of felt tents in the army bazaar belongs to the cookshops, since all the soldiers have need of them.

2) Law and order are maintained as follows. They do not put criminals to death by hanging, or the like. Rather, the prefect (darugha) and the market inspector take them to the execution grounds and there – God forgive us! – the professional executioners administer 360 tortures over three days and three nights.

First they give the offender 300 lashes with a whip or şubend (?) or elephant-penis. Then they strike his knees with drumstick breakers. They drive pieces of straw under his fingernails. They brand him all over with branding irons. They force him to swallow a greasy rag, then pull it out by a thread, which pulls out his stomach and guts as well, and the man is certain to confess his crime. They make him swallow a greased sponge. They bind anklebones of gazelles to his temples. They nail horseshoes and horseshoe nails to his temples. They bore holes in the elbows with a musketeer’s auger; or they bore through the knee so it comes out beneath the sole of the foot, then pour molten lead into the hole so that the lead runs out with the marrow. They tie together his thumbs and big toes and hang him by a noose on a gibbet, then burn sulphur and donkey’s urine until the fumes make the poor man scream. They pry out his shoulder blades and his ribs and collar bone, then crucify him with straps drawn through his back and wind-tapers attached to his shoulders. They crush his testicles with a noose. They shove gorse up his nostrils. They put a burning plate on his head and insert a stylus in his eye. Or they may pull out his penis through his anus, or his anus through his navel so that – God forgive us! – he excretes through his navel. They draw out the man’s gall bladder from under his armpit. If he is a thief they hamstring him. If he has given false witness they mark him with a brand and dock his nose and ears. If he is a persistent thief they cut off both hands and both feet. They have seven ways of hanging a man on the hook, and seven types of impalement.

These are the tortures they inflict for three days and nights in order to set an example for others and to reform mankind (or, as exemplary punishment and corrective punishment).

One day, as the Khan was having these tortures administered in his presence, and was taking pride in them despite our discomfort, I asked, ‘My Khan, what is the purpose of torturing people to this degree?’

‘My brother,’ he said, ‘these are criminals whose guilt has been established by probationary witnesses and who deserve to die. Instead of putting them to death all at once, we subject them to these torments in order that they may serve as warnings to the heedless. They are rebels against God, like Pharaoh who said I am your supreme Lord (79:24). That is why we torture them.’

‘But these are not canonical punishments according to the Sharia,’ I objected. ‘Nor are they effective. Punishments laid down by the religious law are bitter; such as those in the definitive Koranic texts, As for the man or woman who is guilty of theft, cut off their hands (5:38), and We decreed for them a life for a life (5:45). If you followed these commandments your subjects would have greater fear of committing those crimes.’

‘Truly, you give good counsel,’ he replied, acknowledging that I had the better argument.

But they practice these kinds of extreme tortures in order to maintain strict law and order, and because their subjects are riotous and heretical. Also, such arbitrary punishments are traditional.

22 This refers to the mausoleum, now in ruins, of the Ilkhanid ruler Mahmud Ghazan (reg. 1295–1304) which he had built for himself in the village of Sham, west of Tabriz.



23 In the Persian context, Khan and Sultan are titles for provincial governors appointed by the Shah. Javadi and Floor 2010, 21 point out that the governor of Tabriz at that time was Pir Budaq Khan Pornak Turkman. Kelp Ali is apparently based on kalb-i Ali ‘Dog of Ali’, a self-deprecating nickname.

24 One of nine kinds of trumpet that Evliya mentions in Vol. 1, fol. 208a, where he says that it was invented in Iran by Afrasiyab (the arch-enemy of the Iranians in the Shahnama).



25 The term is hârâ, Evliya’s spelling of khârâ. Javadi and Floor 2010, 21 interpret it in this passage as glasswork, elsewhere as porcelain (2) or fabrics (83).

7. Cat-brokers of Ardabil





By God’s wisdom, because cats in Ardabil have short lives, there are very many mice, more than in other regions. The mice chew up the people’s clothing – their woolen cloaks, for example. So this city has a royal auction for hirre, i.e. gürbe, i.e. kutta – i.e. cats. There are professional cat-brokers, much in demand, who sell cats in cages. The Divriği cat is a particular favourite, fetching a price of up to 100 guruş; still, it does not live long here. When the brokers cry their wares, this is the patter they sing, in a loud voice, in the beyati mode:

You who seek a feline,



A cat to hunt your mice:



To rats it makes a beeline,



But otherwise it’s nice;



An enemy to rodents,



And yet it’s not a thief;



A pet to share your grief.





8. Oil wells of Baku





The water here smells of petroleum because near the city in seven places are petroleum wells, each of a different colour – yellow, red, or black. In the districts of Müskir, Sindan and Zeyneb (?) the people do not use candles of beeswax or of ghee, but only lamps burning black petroleum.

[…]

We got an armed retinue of 100 soldiers from the governor of Baku and from Taqi Ali Khan, the governor of Revan, and departed Baku heading south. There are salt marshes along the (Caspian) coast and also, in seven places, wells of petroleum of various colours. We stopped to inspect them – a natural wonder! There are some along the coast and some in the district of Müskir.

By God’s decree, the petroleum bubbles up out of the ground. But, in the manner of hot springs, pools of water are formed with the petroleum congealed on the surface like cream. There is a special agent who gets revenues for the Shah from these wells amounting to 7000 tumans of akçe per year. The agent’s men wade into the pools, collect the petroleum with ladles, and fill goatskins with it, which the oil merchants take to various regions.

There are seven or eight colours of petroleum. The yellow kind is highly regarded. The black kind is a monopoly of the Shah. He transports it to his forts and castles along his borders with the Uzbeks and with the Mughals of India and with the Ottomans in Iraq, Kurdistan, Georgia and Dagestan. When one of these castles is under siege, they use it to light torches around the castle at night. And they soak quilts and old clothing in it which they set ablaze and toss at the army of Islam (i.e., the Ottomans). It serves other important functions as well in their castles and cities. In fact all the torches used in the presence of the Shah and in the royal courts are made from this Baku petroleum. It is a great natural wonder!

The wells are guarded day and night, since any fire sets them ablaze, and then they are not extinguished until the end of time. So mountains of pure soil have been piled up at the rim of each well. If a spark falls on one of the wells, all the subjects rush to the scene and scatter the soil, stopping the fire in this way, by God’s command. There is no other remedy. I have heard that there are also oil wells in other places, amidst rocks or in caves; but the only ones I have seen are these in Baku.





9. Cathedral of Echmiadzin





Üç Kilise (‘Three Churches’) is said to have been built by the Byzantine emperor. It is a wondrous and lofty church, actually three great monasteries, occupied respectively by Armenian girls, by Greeks, and by Armenian men. Of the famous ancient churches in Persia, one is this Üç Kilise; another is Yedi Kenise (‘Seven Churches’) on the road to Nakhchivan.

This too is a mighty church full of wonders and marvels. One noteworthy item is the holy oil or chrism that is manufactured here. The priests and patriarchs gather the grasses and herbs that grow in abundance here and boil them in a huge cauldron that is placed on top of a cloth spread out like a silk carpet. The herbs cook for three hours, but the fire, which is directly beneath the carpet, has no effect on it. Eventually the oil rises to the top of the cauldron. They fill jars and bottles with it and send these as a blessing to Frengistan and throughout Christendom. In return they receive votive offerings from those places. They claim that this oil has medicinal effect against various illnesses, and that it cures wounds when rubbed on them.

Another marvel: in the courtyard of this church, in plain view, there is a thick iron bar suspended underneath a vault. It is permanently suspended, although not attached to anything in any of the six directions. This is indeed a mysterious phenomenon, amounting to white magic. According to the false claim of all the infidels, it is suspended due to the miraculous grace of Simon the Pure (St Peter), one of the disciples of Jesus. Foolish Muslims also are amazed when they see it, and believe in it; because this little iron column trembles when struck by wind. To prevent people from touching it, some devils have set up a railing all around it made of hard acacia wood.

The true explanation is that the ancient sages who constructed the church placed one large magnet at the apex of that vault and another in the ground directly beneath it. The iron bar has been positioned in such a fashion that it remains suspended between the two magnets. So it is not a miracle of Simon or a talisman of Samson. Still, all who see it put finger to mouth in astonishment. This humble one, full of fault, with my faulty intellect, explained it in this fashion; God willing there is no error in my explanation.

This church has roughly 500 priests and monks. Every night five or six hundred people arrive here from Persia and the same number from Turkey. Even before they dismount and remove their horse cloths and sacks, the monks offer their hospitality, bringing date-milk and sugar cane of Hama and Damascus – whatever food they have – and serving them day and night. It is a wonderful convent of his holiness the Messiah.





10. Ankara





Description of the land of Selasil (‘Chains’), the invincible fortress of Ankara, the prosperous walled city of Engürü


First our billeting officer, entering the city with our horse-tail standards, proceeded to the Sharia court where the notables of the province told him, ‘Your pasha holed up in Erzurum intending to become a Celali. The suspicion he aroused then has now proved true. He has raised an army of 10,000 men and has leagued himself in rebellion with Varvar Ali Pasha. We cannot allow you to occupy a walled city belonging to the Padishah.’

Nevertheless, since many of these notables were protegées of our lord the Pasha, they said that we could remain for three days as their guests. The agreement was sealed with the recitation of a Fatiha. Diplomas were issued by the court assigning 2,000 lodgings, and the Pasha was quartered in the house of Çavuşzade.

The following day we entered the castle of Ankara in grand procession, the likes of which the people of Ankara had never seen. The entire populace turned out to greet us. Twenty welcome cannons were fired from the castle walls. When the Pasha was settled in his quarters, all the great notables and small tradesmen came to offer him gifts.

This humble one was a guest in the house of Kederzade, a noble seyyid and a molla with salary of 500 akçe per diem. I went straight to the light-filled tomb of Hacı Bayram Veli, where I rubbed my face on his threshold and began a complete Koran-recital for the sake of his noble spirit. As I had vowed when I got my windfall in the village of Balıkhisar, I paid my votive of 100 guruş, distributing it among the dervishes at the convent of Bayram Veli, and receiving their benedictions in exchange. Then I began to tour the city.

It was founded by the Roman Caesar and passed down from kingdom to kingdom until in the year (—) it was conquered for Islam by Hezardinar, vizier of Ya‘kub Shah of the Germiyan dynasty of Kütahya. Later it was conquered by the Ottoman sultan (—) in the year (—).

It is a gleaming castle and world-famous. When viewed from the village of Erkeksu, which is a day’s journey north, it rises in layers one above the other, like a pearl of great price or like a white swan. Among Ottoman castles it is comparable in this respect to Buda, rampart of Islam, which when viewed from Vac castle a day’s journey north and across the Danube has a grandeur beyond all other Hungarian frontier fortresses, resembling as it does a barge with masts raised and decked out from stem to stern. Another is the castle of Van, rampart of the faith, in Azerbaijan, in description of which the tongue falls short – God willing, it will be recorded in its place. And another is this exemplary castle of Ankara, envy of kings, whose might and prosperity are noted in all tongues and in the chronicles of kings and emperors.

The Persian chronicles, to begin with, report that in Persia this city is called Anguriya because of the abundance of grapes (Persian angur). In the time of the Caesars this city provided 40,000 workers every day for seven years and their daily ration was forty walnuts and one loaf of bread; and based on this ankariye or forced labour the city was called Ankariye. According to oral tradition, both Kayseriye (Kayseri, Caesaria) and Engürü (Ankara) were constructed according to this accounting of forty walnuts and one loaf of bread. The Arab chronicles call it Mutabbak or ‘Layered’ since it is built layer on layer and the layers intertwine. The chronicle of Tuhfe calls it Selasil or ‘Chains’ because in the year of the birth of the Prophet the emperor Heraclius laid siege to this castle and surrounded it with seven layers of chains. Its name in Mongolian is Anagra; in German, since it is an Ottoman possession, Anguriyaopol and Kostantinopol; in Tatar Kirmen-i Angar (fortress of Angar); in Turkish Engürü and Ankırı and İnkırı and Aydınkırı and Unkuru and Anguru. Many terms are applied to it, but in the Ottoman imperial registers its name is Ankara.

The walled town or castle is like a white rose, with layered walls hard to conquer, surrounded by a moat. Poets have praised it in their city eulogies (şehrengiz), and chroniclers have said about it:

All the world’s castles have we seen,



But never have we seen one like this.





It is the seat of an independent sancak-bey in the province of Anatolia. Several times it has been awarded as arpalk or stipend to viziers of three horse-tail standards. According to kanun the imperial has provides an annual income of 263,400 akçe; the sancak has 14 zeamets and 257 timars. Administrative officers include a cavalry marshal, troop commander and captain. During campaign the timariots with their armed retainers along with those pertaining to the governor’s prebend amount to 3,000 armed soldiers. It is the kanun of the Ottoman dynasty that if a timariot fails to be present under the banner of a sancak-bey, his prebend is transferred to someone else.

A total of (—) constabularies pertain to the imperial has of the provincial governor. These include that of the city itself and those of the valleys of Murtat, Yaban, Çubuk, Çorba, etc. They provide the governor with a legitimate tax revenue of 40,000 guruş per annum to support his campaign expenses.

The Sharia administration is headed by a molla with salary of 500 akçe per diem. The total number of sub-districts is (—) flourishing villages. The kadi-districts are the following:

[1.5 lines empty]

They provide the Molla with twenty purses per annum. There are also a şeyhülislam; a nakibüleşraf named Kederzade with salary of 500 akçe per diem; kadi notables in charge of 600 high offices; and countless descendants of the Prophet.

Military officers include an army deputy and a magnificent janissary sergeant in place of a janissary commander, since the populace consists of either kadis (!) or soldiers.

Municipal officers include a city clerk, a market inspector, and a customs agent. The stamp officer of Ankara is a separate agency farmed at the rate of 40 yük of akçe per annum.

There are also a castle warden and deputy, officers of the azeb corps, chiefs of the armourers and the gunners, and a garrison of (—) fully-armed soldiers.

The castle itself, situated at the top of a high mountain, is a mighty fortress like that of Qahqaha, a splendid fortification built of four layers of white stone walls, each layer higher than the next. The layers are separated from each other by 300 paces. The height of the walls is 60 cubits, the width of each wall is 10 royal cubits. The base of the foundations reportedly consists of hollow vaults around the entire perimeter, but I didn’t see it. The reason is to prevent an enemy from undermining the walls during a siege.

This citadel is situated sidelong to the south and oblong from east to west. There are four layers of iron gates, one leading to the next, on the western side; no other castle has such strong iron gates. Between the gates are iron cages suspended by iron chains. The bars forming these cages are the thickness of an arm. When a siege occurs they are lowered in front of the gates within the castle to block the way.

The red-coloured stones of the upper and lower thresholds are also not seen in other castles. Above the arch of the upper threshold of the outermost gate, that opens to the west overlooking the horse market grounds, are hung maces belonging to the heroes of old, also fish skeletons and other marvellous things. Garrison troops guard this gate day and night from within and from without. If the warden ever leaves the castle he is either put to death or dismissed from office. This is because so many enemies have attacked it and a thousand lives have been lost for every stone.

Indeed, when Abaza Pasha turned Celali in Erzurum in the year (—) he laid siege to this castle with 100,000 troops and took possession of the lower town. As Abaza Pasha was sitting in his palace while the siege of the citadel was going on, an expert gunner shot a cannon ball directly at him and wounded him in the rear end, so he returned to Erzurum disappointed. Since that time it has been forbidden for the castle warden to go outside beyond the front gate, and the garrison keeps watch day and night, with their night cry of ‘God is good, He is good!’

To be sure, there is no moat around the upper citadel; but it’s perimeter consists of sheer cliffs and conquering it from any direction is impossible. Nor is it easy to mine the walls, since they are layered and have 366 towers that overlook and protect each other – in such wonderful fashion were they planned and laid out – and the four layers of walls have a total of 1,800 crenelations. The citadel is 4,000 paces in circumference.

There is a hill to the east – it is called Hıdırlık and has a shrine – that is slightly higher than the castle. But no possible harm can come to the citadel from there, since the distance between them is a long cannon’s range, and the area between consists of a deep crevice, betokening the chasm of hell, from the bottom of which it is extremely difficult to climb up to the castle.

There are a total of eighty-one cannons, large and small, in the citadel, but no large balaramada guns, though many culverins and şahi and zarbzen guns. And there is a sufficient quantity of munitions and weapons.

Within the castle are 600 pretty houses, with no orchards or gardens. The ancient mosque of (—) is located there, converted from a church ages ago. All the houses and public buildings are covered with pure clay. In short, this citadel is noteworthy from the point of view of its construction and of its architecture.

As to the lower town, in the year (—), from fear of the Celalis, Cenabi Ahmed Pasha,30 with the help of the people of the province, built a strong single-layered wall around it. It has four gates. It is 6,000 paces in circumference on three sides; the fourth side is the upper citadel, which the lower castle surrounds. On the eastern side one can go down the cliffs from the upper castle to the Hıdırlık valley. There are water conduits in the cliffs, and in the citadel there are cisterns and wheat storehouses; but in this lower castle, because of the abundance of streams, there are no cisterns but 170 fountains and 3,000 wells.

The gates in the perimeter of the castle are, first, on the (—) side

There are a total of seventy-six prayer-niches of which (—) are Friday mosques. First is the Cenabi Ahmed Pasha mosque, and the Hacı Bayram Veli mosque; these two were constructed by Sultan Süleyman’s architect Sinan.

[1.5 lines empty]

Few of the mosques are covered with lead tiles; rather they are all covered with pure clay. The remainder are small neighbourhood mosques.



There are eighteen dervish convents with prayer-niches. The most flourishing is that of Hacı Bayram Veli with over 300 mystics who have wasted their bodies with divine love. Their sheikh, Koca Abdurrahman Efendi, is considered to possess the miraculous graces of a saint, and one whose prayers are accepted by God.

The Bayramis are an independent branch of the Hamidi Sufi order, Hacı Bayram Veli having received the equipment of poverty from Sheikh Hamid whose disciple he was. The spiritual lineage is traced back to Hoca Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani (founder of the Qadiri Sufi order) and through him back to the Prophet. But in Turkey the Bayramis have been reviled, and some of their sheikhs killed, on the grounds that they are Hamzawis going back to Sheikh Hamza and Sheikh Idris. They have no badges on their cloaks and turbans. And while they have committed no act contrary to the Sharia, they are accused and held in suspicion, a band of liver-roasted (i.e., suffering) dervishes.

Then in Ankara is the convent of his majesty Mawlana Jalaladdin Rumi, may his secret be sanctified, a Mevlevi lodge constructed by Cenabi Ahmed Pasha, an orchard of Iram with rose-gardens on three sides.

[1.5 lines empty]

There are (—) medreses, including those of Mustafa Pasha, Cenabi Ahmed Pasha, Taşköprüzade, Seyfeddin, Husrev Kethüda, etc. The ones I have named are the most famous, each with numerous cells and domed classrooms, and each providing its students with room and board and candles.

There are three schools of Prophetic Hadith.

There are a 180 elementary schools.

There are (—) public baths, including those of Tahtakale, Sunkuroğlu, Cenabi Ahmed Pasha, etc.

[1 line empty]

These are delightful baths with invigorating atmosphere. There are also 200 private baths, according to the boast of the notables of the province.

There are seventy great and lofty palaces with their orchards and gardens – delightful mansions with layer on layer of walls, all of which are brick, however, not stone. Also none of the public buildings in this city has a tiled roof but rather all are covered with pure clay. And all the houses are made of brick, since the Ankara brick is famous and hard as granite. Note the popular expression, ‘lined in a mold like Ankara bricks’ – when anything is lined up in order it is likened to Ankara bricks. It is a great city, with 6,066 flourishing houses made of brick. And among the palaces are those of Kederzade, Çavuşzade, Ahmed Pasha, etc. There are many others, but these are the ones I am familiar with.

There are (—) hans of the merchants, including

[1 line empty]

The rest are small guest-houses.

There are 200 fountains of pure nectar (76:21), the famous ones being those of Hacı Şa‘ravi and Hacı Nasuh.

There are 2,000 shops and an ornate bedestan with four chained gates. Most of the markets are situated at a high elevation. Long Market and Army Market and, in the lower castle, Tahtakale Market are very crowded and prosperous. The coffee shops and barber shops are also famously crowded. All the sultanic markets and all the major roads in the quarters are paved end to end with pure white stones.

Notables and seyyids and viziers, ulema and sheikhs and poets, are beyond number and beyond compare. True, this is Anatolia and the province consists mainly of Turkish peasants; still, one finds writers and authors, Koran interpreters and experts in Hadith, and Koran reciters who chant it with proper enunciation. And there are over 2,000 mature and clever boys and girls who have memorised the Koran. Thousands of people have also memorised the Muhammediye of Yazıcızade Mehmed Efendi (completed in 1443) and the Tarikat-i Muhammediye (of Birgili Mehmed Efendi, completed in 1572).

Indeed there are many pious men who follow the Muhammadan path (tarik-i Muhammedi). One of these is Abdurrahman Efendi – the one who is considered to possess the miraculous graces of a saint. His transfigured face is characterised as ‘four-stroke’ meaning that it is free of moustache, beard, eyebrows and eyelashes. He is a descendant of the sainted Hacı Bayram Veli whose face also came to be characterised in that manner, as the following legend goes to show.

One day a deceitful woman invited him to her house in order to recite the Koran for the spirit of her late father. Bayram Veli, who was at the beginning of his ministry, agreed. After reciting a portion of ten Koranic verses, that notorious Zulaykha approached Hacı Bayram and said, ‘My dear, what fine eyebrows you have, and what a fine shapely beard, and what eyelashes, and what doe-like eyes daubed by the hand of Power.’

‘Lady,’ said Hacı Bayram Veli, put off guard by these advances, ‘wait just a minute, I need to go to the bathroom.’ He took a ewer, secreted himself in a corner, and prayed, ‘My lord, you know my condition. Don’t blacken my face (i.e., shame me) in your glorious presence. Let me be the most loathsome creature in the world, but free me from these brows and lashes and moustache and beard.’

That instant, by God’s command, no trace of hair remained on his radiant face, which now shone like a polished gourd. Thanking God profusely he returned to the woman and greeted her. She, however, now finding him repulsive, cried, ‘Girls, strike this pimp who has no place in the harem!’

They drove him out of the house. Thus did our saint escape that predicament. He remained shaved in this fashion for the rest of his life. That is why many of the gentlemen who descend from his daughter have pretty faces and wispy beards.

While in this city I associated with many another saint and lover (of God); may God be pleased with them all.

Generally the great merchants here wear sable cloaks; the middle class wear broadcloth serhaddi and kontuş cloaks of various colours; the tradesmen wear white cotton twill and mohair; and the ulema woolen cloaks of various colours, since Ankara is a major source of wool. The women also wear varicoloured woolen cloaks and go about very modestly.

Since it is in the fifth true clime and seventeenth conventional clime31 the latitude is (—) and longitude is (—). The climate is very mild, the people’s complexion ruddy, the lovely boys and girls praised around the world.

Of foodstuffs and other products, first of all Ankara trotters are equal to those of Kütahya. Ankara pressed meat cured with seeds of fenugreek is very tasty, as is the meat of Angora goats that feed on holm oak leaves in the mountains.

The Angora goat is a snow-white he-goat found nowhere else. The goat hair is the source of wool thread used for multi-coloured woolen garments worn by emperors. If the hair is shorn the thread is rough, but if it is plucked out it is as soft as Job’s silk. When the poor goats’ hair is plucked out their bleats reach high heaven. But sensitive individuals have found a solution to this lamentation. They mix lime and ashes in water and wash the goats with this limed sherbet just before plucking them. Then the hairs come out painlessly, leaving the goats naked and bleating. The thread made from this goat hair is woven into woolen cloth and mohair. All the populace, including the women, are involved in this enterprise.





How waved wool (or mohair) is manufactured. They put a large cauldron, half-filled with water and the desired dye, over a fire. They pile the woolen cloth layer by layer over wooden trestles and place these inside the cauldron, which they then cover and daub with fermented dough. They then stoke the fire so the water in the cauldron turns to steam which strikes the cloth with varicoloured streaks. It is the work of God (i.e., a natural process), producing an effect that even the pen of Mani or Bihzad would be incapable of.

This mohair is also a speciality of Ankara, impossible to find elsewhere. Some bastard Franks brought some of these Angora goats to Frengistan and tried to spin their wool and weave the resulting thread. By God’s command the goats died within a year, and they were unable to give a wave to the wool they wove. Finally they brought some of the woollen thread that had been spun in Ankara, but still could not make mohair out of it. So now they only make the thin black waveless homespun woolen cloth that their monks wear.

The Ankaraites attribute the special qualities of Angora wool to the miraculous grace of Hacı Bayram Veli and to their salubrious climate. Indeed, the woolens produced here do not have their equal elsewhere, and the mohair is particularly famous, as is Ankara brick, etc. Most of the populace are merchants on land and sea, trading in mohair wherever it is esteemed – Izmir, Frengistan, Arabia, Egypt, and the seven climes.

There are many Armenians and Jews; of the city quarters, ten are Armenian and two are counted as Jewish congregations; but there are few Greeks or Gypsies. Orchards are few but gardens are many. But the villages in the countryside are flourishing; the populace of the city wealthy and happy; the buildings excellent; the people handsome and hospitable; the crops plentiful; charitable institutions abundant; blessings overflowing; streams and rivers ever flowing. An altogether prosperous city and incomparable castle – may God maintain it in the hands of the Ottomans until the end of time!





The righteous dream of lowly Evliya. On the same day that I entered the walled city of Ankara I visited the shrine of Hacı Bayram Veli and began a complete Koran recital, then came to my quarters. Following the evening prayer and the recital of my litanies I uttered the prayer for a dream-omen and went to sleep. In my dream I saw a man of middle height with a blond beard and wearing a honey-coloured woolen cloak. On his head was a Muhammadan turban with twelve folds wrapped around a veledi cap. He approached me and said, ‘Look here, my son. Is it right that you should go to visit my pupil Kösec (‘Wispy-beard’) Bayram Veli and step over me? Is it right that you should begin a Koran recital for him and pass me by without even a Fatiha?’

‘Noble sir, who are you? I don’t think I know you. And where do you reside?’

‘In your youth, when you cried the prayer for wrestlers in the Lodge of the Wrestlers and in the presence of Sultan Murad, didn’t you used to say, ‘In Ankara lies Er / In Rum Sarı Saltuk’? Well, I am Er Sultan in Ankara. I lie inside a dismal tomb in the Woodcutters’ Market near the lower citadel. Visit me there. Cheer me with a Fatiha, and you will be cheered and get your wish in this world and the next. Tomorrow after the morning-prayer I will send you a man who will look just like me. Put your hand in his, tour the city with him and come to visit me. Peace be upon you.’

With that he disappeared. I awoke, performed my ablutions and stood waiting for the time of the dawn prayer. After the prayer one of the Pasha’s servants arrived and invited me to breakfast. ‘No my son, today I am fasting,’ I said, and got rid of him.

Suddenly, the person whom I had seen that night in my dream appeared. He greeted me and said: ‘Evliya Çelebi, is that you? In our dream Er Dede Sultan sent me to you. Come, let us go visit him.’ But his speech seemed to emerge from under the ground. To be sure, his face was radiant and his words were sweet and touching. I donned my cloak and stepped outside with a besmele.

As we proceeded on foot, he named and described the great saints buried in eleven places within the city, making me stop at each one and pay a pilgrimage-visit. ‘This is my pupil,’ he would say; or else, ‘This is the successor to the saintly Hamid Efendi.’ He held my hand fast and we made a complete tour of the pilgrimage sites; God willing, they will be recorded below. But, though he held my hand fast, his own hand had absolutely no bones: whichever way I bent it, it gave way like dough. Occasionally he would remove his hand from mine, point out a pilgrimage-site, and again clasp my hand.

We went on, discussing matters related to the afterlife, until we arrived at the place known as the Woodcutters’ Market. At the western side of the square there was a small tomb, hardly visible. ‘There is the tomb of Er Sultan,’ he said, pointing with his right hand. I looked in that direction, and when I looked back, he had disappeared. ‘Oh dear,’ I said, ‘I shouldn’t have let go of his hand. Now what will become of me?’ I wandered about in a daze, in the dim light of dawn. The place where that person disappeared was a main road, but now it too had disappeared both in front of me and behind. ‘He must have gone inside that little door covered with felt,’ I said. I opened the door and went in.

Would you believe it? The place turned out to be a tavern! And there were a bunch of the Pasha’s servants and muleteers and donkey-boys, some playing the guitar and the lute and raising a hullabaloo. ‘Evliya Çelebi!’ cried one of them, ‘Come and have some boza.’ When I realised that I had been seen entering a tavern, I wanted to sink into the ground from shame. I ran outside, went over to the tomb of Er Sultan, opened the door and entered.

‘Peace upon you, O saintly sheikh,’ I said, weeping the while, and rubbing this rebellious face of mine in the dust of the threshold. ‘You appeared in my dream and told me that you would send me a guide on the path, and you kept your word. But you took him from my hand before I could be guided aright. I have come to visit you and to rub my face at your gate. For the sake of God’s beloved (i.e., the Prophet Muhammad) do not leave me forlorn in this world and the next. I swear by God that I will perform a complete Koran-recital for the sake of your noble spirit,’ and I began the recital then and there. Meanwhile I crawled beneath the green woolen coverlet that lay over the noble cenotaph, crying, ‘Protection, O Er Sultan, protection!’

I fell asleep almost immediately – I was sweating so much that the sweat poured from my clothes – and again I saw the figure of Er Sultan, dressed as in my previous dream. He greeted me and I returned the greeting. ‘My lord,’ said I, ‘I lost the man you sent to conduct me here, so I have come to your gate without intermediary. Do not turn me back empty-handed.’

‘You will not be left forlorn,’ he replied, ‘for you are one who preserves the Koran in his memory, and one who loves God’s friends and rubs his face at the thresholds of the great saints. Out of my love for you I appeared in your dream and said that I would send someone to conduct you here, and I told you to hold his hand; and the next morning I arrived and clasped your hand in mine. I am your perfect guide who will lead you to the path of Truth.

‘Do not distress yourself. Your final path in the end, safe and sound, is the Straight Path. But keep to the straight and narrow while you are roaming about with these ruffians. Take pity on the poor and the weak. Try to extricate yourself from these ruffians. Tell your pasha that while he is shutting himself up as a Celali in this dear little Ankara of mine he should not harm the people who are in my precinct.

‘As for you: God grant completion of your journey, faith at your final breath, intercession of the Prophet as your share (in the next world), and bodily health as you roam about (this) world. Eat little, speak little, and sleep little. Do much for the sake of knowledge – in the end one must perform good deeds in order to find the path of truth; as the Koran states: The good word is heard by Him and the good deed exalted (35:10). Keep to this counsel of mine, and carry out your obligations to your parents. Do not forget me in your prayers, and hold in reverence the holy sheikhs and patron saints. Go, may God bring you right, may your end be good.’

‘A Fatiha on this intention,’ said I, and recited a Fatiha. As I was kissing his hand a clamour rose outside the door of the light-filled tomb, and someone shouted: ‘Doesn’t this tomb have a keeper?’ At this I awoke and crawled out from under Er Sultan’s woolen cenotaph-cover, in a daze and drenched in sweat. It seems that quite a few pilgrims had come to visit the noble grave. ‘Are you the tomb’s keeper?’ they said. ‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘I have become a servant at this shrine.’ They performed their visitation, and I, uttering the Fatiha of farewell, shut the door of felicity behind me and returned weeping to my quarters.

I immediately reported my dream to the Pasha. ‘I beg God’s forgiveness,’ he cried. ‘Turn to God in true repentance (66:8). Tell the regiment commanders and the Segban and Sarıca soldiery to deliver up the munitions and muskets and other arms. Henceforth it is forbidden to shut ourselves up as Celalis in this walled city of Ankara.’ He gathered the arms from all the military regiments, and the town fell quiet.

It turned out that the Pasha had also seen Er Sultan in his dream which, as he narrated it to me, fit mine exactly. So it seems that the Pasha actually had conceived the idea of shutting himself up in Ankara as a Celali.

After this I took it upon myself to visit the tombs of Er Sultan and of Hacı Bayram Veli Sultan every day, and I also finished the complete Koran-recitals that I had started.





Account of the shrines of the great saints resting in Ankara. First the magnificent Pole and esteemed Column, ascetic of the age and worshipper unique, speaker of truths and counsellor of virtues, chief of men and point of perfection, absolute sheikh and verified Pole, mine of divine wisdom and dweller in the godly hut, his holiness Sheikh Hacı Bayram Veli, may God sanctify us with his precious secret.

Born in the village of Sol on the bank of the Çu River (— illegible), he received the equipment of poverty from his holiness Sheikh Hamid and under that sheikh’s spiritual guidance was the Pole of Poles for some years and exhibited thousands of miraculous graces. In the course of travel he came to Edirne in the year (—), during the reign of Sultan Bayezid the Thunderbolt (1389–1402), and mounted the pulpit of the Old Friday Mosque (Eski Cami), built by that sultan as a blessing, to preach; that very pulpit is still standing in that ancient light-filled mosque. It often happened that other sheikhs mounted that pulpit and, finding themselves tongue-tied, were unable to preach; for a sheikh qualified to sit lightly on that prayer-rug had not appeared, let alone one who could preach fearlessly. Bayram Veli was such a great saint. He died during the reign of the Thunderbolt and was buried in the splendid light-filled dome of the convent in the castle of Ankara, as mentioned above – may God have mercy upon him.

Then the tomb of the one whose prayer is answered, source of saintly lights, revealer of the mysteries of truth […] his holiness Sheikh Er Sultan. His noble name was Mahmud. He was a disciple of Sheikh Hamid in the Qadiri Sufi order. Thousands of his miraculous graces became evident. Praise God, this humble one was vouchsafed the visitation of his tomb, and also the vision of him in my dream. Thus I got a share of his mystical guidance although he was already in the other world – may God have mercy upon him. He rests in a small domed chamber in the Woodcutters’ Market inside Ankara and is visited by elite and commoners alike – may his secret be sanctified.

Then the tomb of his holiness Hızır, on a lofty mountain overlooking Ankara castle to the east (i.e., Hıdırlık, see above). People go there for a picnic and to take in the view of the entire Ankara plain spread out before them like varicoloured paper.

The tomb of Sheikh Hüsameddin, disciple of Ahmed Sarbani. While imprisoned in Ankara castle he said ‘Bury me tomorrow’ and on the next day, although no man or jinn had access to his prison cell, he was found wrapped in a yellow shroud of date-palm fibre, his body washed and perfumed. All were amazed at this. He is buried in the enclosed graveyard of his convent.

The tomb of Katib Salahaddin. As an astronomer he was a second Pythagoras. He is the author of such works as Melheme (on eschatology) and Ta‘birname (on dream interpretation).

Aside from these shrines there are several thousand tombs of authors and scholars and saints, both inside and outside Ankara. But because I only stayed there a few days these few were all that I recorded – may God have mercy upon them all.

As we were about to depart from Ankara, and the horse-tail standards were going with the billeting officer, I wished to lighten my load. So I sold one of the mule-trains I had got from Hacı Baba to the Pasha for a purse of guruş, which I gave away as alms to the poor, receiving a goodly reward in exchange, in accordance with the Koranic verse: He that does a good deed shall be repaid tenfold (6:160). As for the rest of my heavy baggage, and all the windfall treasures that the above-mentioned Hacı Baba gave me in the robbers’ den, I deposited them for safekeeping with my host and benefactor Kederzade Efendi. Thus I was left with seven armed slaves and one lightly-furnished packhorse, ready to depart the following morning.

But the next day, at the time of the morning prayer, a tremendous hubbub broke out and a hue and cry that shook earth and sky. As we wondered what was going on we heard the cries of so many thousands of soldiers. Some said, ‘We are pleased with the Pasha, he is innocent!’ Others said, ‘It is the Sultan’s to command! The Pasha is a Celali in alliance with Varvar and his followers are bandits!’

It turned out that one of the imperial chief porters, Mustafa Agha, had arrived with forty men bringing a noble rescript demanding that the Pasha be put to death. They shut the castle gates and had criers go about announcing a call to arms.

By God’s wisdom, that night the Pasha had had a fearful dream, so he had put on a disguise, mounted an Arab steed, slipped out the castle gate and gone to the shrine of Hüseyn Gazi, the father of Seydi Battal Gazi. This was his usual practice in such circumstances. When the chief porter and his men raided the Pasha’s palace, they could not find him. They scoured the city inside and out but found no trace of him.

When the Pasha got wind of all this he decided not to go back into Ankara but proceeded to the place called Erkeksu north of the city. He sent a peasant with a message to his deputy Ali Agha requesting him to send his troops.

Meanwhile, when the Pasha was not found, the castle gates were opened and criers announced that, by imperial decree, any of the Pasha’s men who were found henceforth would be killed and their wealth confiscated. All the Pasha’s banished men were conducted out of Ankara and warned not to enter any city with a minaret if they valued their lives.

As for this humble one, I bid farewell to our host, made farewell visits to the tombs of Hacı Bayram Veli and Er Dede Sultan, and proceeded seven hours north of Ankara to the stage of Erkeksu. It is a flourishing Muslim village at the foot of a cliff in the district of Ankara, with 200 houses, a Friday mosque, an imposing han, but no orchards and gardens.

From there, after another (—) hours, we came to the great town of Istanoz, on the border of the Murtat valley district. It is administered by a constable of the governor of Ankara and a kadi with salary of 150 akçe per diem. It is situated at the edge of a narrow ravine between two high cliffs. There are 1,000 houses, without orchards and gardens, a Friday mosque, a public bath, and a small marketplace. The river (—) flows through it.

Formerly there were large gates at both ends of this town, but they were destroyed when Celali Karayazıcı pillaged it during the reign of Sultan Mehmed III. If they were repaired it would be impossible to conquer this town from any direction. Because on both sides rise sheer cliffs, red and yellow, where hawks and falcons and eagles have their eyries, so lofty that a person would not dare look down. These are imposing and frightful rocks such as those of Van, Şebin(karahisar) and Mardin castles. Some are hollow at the base like Mt Bisutun, some swoop down from above like dragons, or have wondrous shapes like lions or elephants.

Most of the populace are Armenians. There are reported to be 1,000 looms for the processing of mohair. Being inside a valley, the weather gets very hot; nevertheless the mohair produced here is of a fine quality. Also the Armenian girls are famous. There are caverns in the cliffs where you could comfortably fit a thousand horses tied together. And there is a small ruined castle dating from antiquity atop one of the sheer cliffs.

By God’s wisdom, on the day we entered this town it was swarming with people. It turned out that a tightrope walker convention was going on.





Spectacle of master acrobats, the tightrope walkers. Once every forty years all the tightrope walkers gather here to vie and contest their skills. There are two places in Anatolia where these tightrope walker conventions take place, one being this valley of Istanoz and the other the town of Gediz. We too, now idle and unemployed, had nothing better to do than attend as spectators. What should we see?

The ropes – whipcords, of Frankish manufacture – were strung across the ravine from one cliff to the other and secured at either end by sheepskins, lest they be frayed by the rocks. Also armed guards were stationed to ensure that no rival cut the rope while a master was performing. Thousands of people gathered in the ravine below and on the cliffs above to observe the spectacle. In the previous week benches and bleachers had been set up on both sides of the river, and tourists had pitched their tents in the fields nearby. The governor of Ankara province had sent his military band and it was banging away on both sides and crying blessings upon the Prophet. Now the master tightrope walkers issued challenges to each other.

First up was chief of the guild, Sipah Mehmed Çelebi from Üsküdar.32 With a besmele he seized the balancing beam in his huge hands and proceeded boldly out on the rope, crying Allah Allah! The sound of his voice mingled with the banging of the drums and resounded among the cliffs like thunder. His rope, known as a testing rope, was extremely thin, but he flashed out on it like lightning. When he reached the middle he suddenly turned and scampered back, like a rabbit turning before a hound. The spectators, amazed at this feat of white magic – for it is beyond human capacity to turn on a rope while running at full speed – all cried out: ‘God help you, O Pehlivan!’ Sipah Mehmed performed this manoeuvre three times, shouted a benediction to the crowd, then rushed down to his tent, leaving his servant-boys to go out among the crowd and gather coins.

Next came Civelik Ali, a veteran tightrope walker from Isparta. He bowed to the chief of the guild, uttered a benediction, and climbed up to the rope. His speciality was to grasp the balancing beam at the end by one hand – the standard practice being to grasp it in the middle by both hands – and, letting it hang down, cross to the other side like a bolt of lightning. Performers and spectators alike marvelled at this feat. He then switched hands and returned, walking backwards. As he accomplished this superhuman feat the audience cried ‘God make it easy!’ Once back at the starting-point, Civelik Ali slithered down the pole upside-down and kissed the ground in front of the chief of the guild who said ‘God bless you, Pehlivan!’ and pressed him to his chest.

Third was Pehlivan Şücah from Harput, who didn’t bother with a balance beam at all, but instead he held in each hand a jar full of water. At the end of his performance he flung himself from the pole onto the ground, while the spectators held their breath. By God’s command, he neither harmed himself nor broke the two jars. This feat won him the admiration of the crowd and the congratulation of the guild chief whose hand he kissed.

Fourth was Hasan Zavil from Tokat, a seventy-year-old master who had performed before the Mughal emperor in India. He too kissed the guild chief’s hand. He wore a pair of new Kubadi slippers and had a celadon bowl full of water perched on his gilded turban. He too scorned the use of the balance beam, but instead held tight to the sleeves of his stiff cloak of red broadcloth known as muvahhidi. Thus he crossed over and back, and the crowd went wild.

Fifth up was Pehlivan Sührab from Gerger (a town on the Euphrates between Malatya and Siverek). On his feet he had a pair of tall clogs of the sort that women wear to the baths, and on his shoulders he bore a live calf; but he did make use of the balance beam in going back and forth on that thin tightrope in those clogs – an acrobatic feat.

Sixth was Pehlivan Nasır from the Maghreb. He too used the balance beam, but crossed the ravine blindfolded and carrying on his back one of his servant-boys who beat the drum all the while.

Seventh was Pehlivan Selim from Arapgir, wearing only leather tights and carrying a flintlock musket in each hand which he shot off as he crossed, then reloaded and shot again as he crossed back.

Eighth was Pehlivan Nasreddin from Djerba in Tunisia. His speciality was to cross on the tightrope, not only without using a balance beam, but also without even using his feet. He accomplished this feetless feat by attaching rings to his sidelocks and hanging the rings from the rope, and thus, suspended by his hair, he gradually slid along the tightrope by propelling himself with a kind of ball the size of a watermelon that he turned with a string like a top. No one could even have imagined such a feat.

Ninth was Kızkapan Süleyman from Galata, an apprentice of the chief of the guild, who also appeared in leather breeches. His trick was to go inside a little box, which he first held out to the audience to demonstrate that it was nothing more than a plain square wooden box lined with paper, and to speed back and forth across the tightrope while inside the box, which was suspended to it by an iron ring. He returned in the same way, then emerged from the box and bowed before his master. This feat too was beyond the comprehension of a rational observer.

There were many more than these. In fact, the convention went on for three days and nights, and a total of seventy-six tightrope walkers displayed their various skills. If I recorded all of these I would become a professional eulogist for tightrope walkers; so what I have recorded is sufficient. They also graduated 300 apprentice tightrope walkers, all of whom performed their stunts. In the course of three days the townsmen, especially the Armenians, produced 600 woollens and the same number of mohairs, and received as reward a purse of guruş from our lord the Pasha.





(Eventually Evliya falls into the hands of Ipşir Pasha who has been pursuing the rebels. He fearfully asks to be dismissed, insisting that he is with Mehmed Pasha only ‘for travel’s sake’. He recovers his property in Ankara.)

VOLUME THREE





In the Retinue of Melek Ahmed Pasha





EVLIYA DEPARTS for Damascus with its governor Silihdar Murtaza Pasha in September 1648. On the way he stops briefly at Akşehir, home of Nasreddin Hoca, the legendary subject of so much Turkish humour. His peregrinations in the Holy Land include a stay in Safed (cf. Volume 9, selection 3) where he encounters a community of Sephardic Jews. He considers Ladino (or Judaeo-Spanish, which he had also heard in Istanbul and was later to hear in Salonica) to be the Jewish language par excellence. While in Damascus he has encounters with the colourful Sheikh Bekkar the Naked (cf. Volume 9, selection 5).

A year later Murtaza Pasha is appointed governor of Sivas, and Evliya accompanies him there. At the end of his long description of the city, we find the satirical story of the girl who gave birth to an elephant, and his description of the Armenian language. Stopping at Divriği, he sees the cats that he had found auctioned in Ardabil (Volume 2, selection 7). With the Pasha’s dismissal from office, Evliya returns to Istanbul in July 1650.

He now attaches himself to another kinsman, Melek Ahmed Pasha. For the next twelve years Evliya is in Melek Pasha’s service, and his travel itinerary follows the various posts to which the Pasha is assigned as governor (beylerbey). In this volume we hear about Evliya’s travels with Melek Pasha in Thrace and the Balkans. He reports on witchcraft in a Bulgarian village; on hot springs (cf. those of Bursa, Volume 2, selection 2) and prostitution in Sofia; and, in the countryside, on a fountain that tests for homosexual proclivities.

Evliya returns to Istanbul in 1653.





1. Nasreddin Hoca in Akşehir33





Description of the saints’ tombs of Akşehir


First, in the cemetery outside the city to the south is buried the scholar of worldly and religious matters, Simurgh of Mt Qaf of certainty, the sheikh Hoca Nasreddin. He was born here in Akşehir during the reign of Gazi Hudavendigar (Sultan Murad I, reg. 1362–89) and grew up during the reign of Bayezid (I) the Thunderbolt (reg. 1389–1402). He was a great saint, with many virtues and a ready wit, and displayed miraculous graces.

He consorted with Timur34 who enjoyed his company and, for his sake, exempted this city of Akşehir from pillage. The counsels and pleasantries of Nasreddin Hoca are on everybody’s lips and have become proverbial. For example:

One day Timur went with the Hoca to the public bath. As they were bathing themselves, each wrapped in a bath-cloth, Timur said, ‘Hoca, if it were necessary for a world-conquering emperor like my humble self to be sold, how much would you buy me for?’

‘40 akçe,’ he replied.

‘Hey Hoca,’ he said, ‘my bath-cloth is worth 40 akçe.’

‘Yes, and I would buy the bath-cloth for 40 akçe. Otherwise you’re a lame and wounded fellow from the band of Mongols, you’re not worth a Hille penny!’

Timur enjoyed this display of wit and showered him with gifts.

There are many such jokes and pleasantries. After the death of the Thunderbolt he lived until the reign of Çelebi Sultan Mehmed (I, reg. 1413– 21). He is buried in a domed shrine outside this city of Akşehir, and a railing surrounds the tomb.





Adventure of this humble one. When the trumpet signal for departure was sounded at midnight and the heavy baggage had left, I too sent off my servants and left the city at midnight with one slaveboy. I recalled the belief that if one visits the tomb of Hoca Nasreddin and remembers some of his pleasantries, one is bound to laugh. Wondering if this was true, I veered left off the main road with my horse and went straight toward his noble tomb.

‘Peace upon you, O people of the graves!’ said I. Thereupon a voice came from within Nasreddin’s shrine, ‘And upon you peace, O princely soul!’

My horse started with a grunt, rose up on its hind legs and tore through the cemetery. I had a hard time reining him in. One of his legs tripped on a grave, and I nearly suffered the torment of the grave.

‘Agha!’ cried the voice from the Hoca’s tomb. ‘Give alms and go laughing, but be sure to come back.’ It turned out to be the tomb’s keeper.

‘Hey, fellow, I greeted the people of the graves (ehl-i kubur), you are people of the backsides (ehl-i dübur), so why did you return the greeting?’ I gave him a few akçe.

‘Go, may God be your helper.’ He sent me off with this benediction, and I indeed went laughing at these events.

33 n.b. Evliya was probably never in Akşehir since, aside from some administrative details derived from a written source, and the passage above, the only information about it he mentions is that it is famous for its apples.

2. Safed





Description of Kafr Nahon, i.e. the notable city of Safed, country of the Jews, province of Canaan, town of the Yids35


After the Deluge its founder was Shem, son of Noah – peace be on him. Until the time of Jacob this city prospered so much that even cities like Askalon, Hasan (Bilbays), Palestine, Tiberias, Jerusalem and Zagzaga were not so prosperous as this city of Safed. That is because all the Children of Israel originated from Safed and had their ancient Temple here. This city has become their Ka‘ba – saving the comparison! – and remains so even to this day.

When Sultan Selim (I) took this city from the Sultan al-Ghawri of the Egyptian Circassian (Mamluk) dynasty in the year 922 (1516) it had, according to the register of Tavaşi Sinan Pasha, a harac tax on 600,000 Jews. Today between seventy and eighty thousand Jews still live here, their houses layer on layer. According to their vain belief, a Jew cannot be considered anything but a Karaite Yid if he does not visit this city once in his life; or, if being unable to do so, he does not rub his face with its dust; or if he does not drink from its water; or does not fumigate himself with the (smoke of the) autumnal leaves of its trees.

I have recorded elsewhere the founder of this city and its being the capital of the Jews together with its public edifices and buildings, pious foundations, and chronograms. In volume (—) (9) of our Book of Travels dealing with the Hajj, I have written a detailed account of all the shrines of the sons and daughters of Jacob and the sons of Ishmael; Jacob’s House of Sorrows; and the houses of Ephraim son of Joseph, Isaac, Ishmael and Job, together with a thousand other notes.

For this year’s journey I will record here the language of the Jews according to the language of the Torah, since those who are world-travellers and boon-companions of mankind must have a smattering of every language.





Description of the Language of the Jews. The Yid Jews are an ancient and accursed people. Of the 124,000 prophets, 4,000 did not die in their beds but were martyred by this tribe of Jews. The fact that they martyred such prophets as John, Zachariah, George, etc. is recorded in thousands of commentaries and histories.

Two books were revealed to one religious community. One is the Book of Psalms which God revealed to the prophet David; as attested by the Koranic verse: To David We gave the Psalms (17:55). David was initially a preacher and counsellor who recited the Psalms in a loud Davidic voice. He made his living by fashioning iron into armour. Then God commanded David to wage war on King Goliath. King Saul believed in David. There was a great battle in the plain of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo where David crushed Goliath’s head with a sling shot and killed him instantly. God gave David Goliath’s kingdom, and thus he became both prophet and emperor, as attested by the verse in the Sura of al-Baqara: David slew Goliath, and God bestowed on him sovereignty (2:251).

The Book of Psalms, revealed to David, does not contain promise and threat, narrative, command and prohibition, permitted and forbidden; rather it consists entirely of prayers. All that the rabbis recite from their leather straps in the synagogues of the tribe of Judah are psalms, and what they swear by is the book of Psalms. As for the Torah, revealed to Moses, it is entirely promise and threat, command and prohibition, narrative, permitted and forbidden, paradise and hell and purgatory, resurrection and judgement. Everything in the Torah has to do with judgement, as in the Koranic verse: Nor anything green or sear, but is recorded in a glorious Book (6:59).

Aside from the Jews, among the Christians as well – the infidels of Sweden, Holland, Dunkerque, Denmark, Germany, etc. – they all read the Torah and the Psalms and they speak Jewish (Yahudice). But the Jews are a bunch of erring infidels whose sect is contrary to that of the Christians.

The Jewish language is this: un 1 dos 2 tire 3 kotra 4 çinko 5 si 6 sete 7 ota 8 nova 9 deç 10 kim anda What are you saying? venki Come! un dos Where were you? inkaza I was at home miyalom My dear ki kaziyan What were you doing? avra porta Open the door serele porta Shut the door miyaloma sinyor vamoz sadaka My dear sir, go to alms miyaloma ono pa çuz dami My dear, give me a vagina miyaloma bono andam My dear, look at me nicely miyaloma andami sinyor si My dear, look, my dear sir.

The tribe of Jews has countless words and expressions other than these, but this much will suffice. Also there are many things to describe about the city of Safed, but they are all recorded above (i.e., below in Volume 9).

35 n.b. Cuhud and its derivative Çufut are derogatory variants of Yahud meaning ‘Jews’.





3. Sheikh Bekkar the Naked on the road outside Damascus





Description of the Stages and Castles and Cities on our Journey from Damascus to Turkey in the year 1059 (1649)


On the first day of the month of Dhu’l-qa‘da in that year (6 November 1649) Emir Pasha, removed from office in Egypt, arrived in Damascus and set up camp in the Blue Square (Gökmeydanı). On the same day our lord Murtaza Pasha departed from Damascus. We went north, skirting the Damascus orchards, to the stages of Harasta … Kusayra … Katife … Karalar castle … Caravanserai of the Two Gates (İkikapulu hanı).

This is a great han with two gates, like a castle, in one of the Damascus districts. Its governor and benefactor is (—) Pasha, as I recorded above. Departing from this place we were proceeding north through the desert with all the troops.





Saintly deeds of Sheikh Bekkar the Naked. A certain Sheikh Bekkar showed up from the east, with bare head and bare feet and bare chest, both hands on his shoulders, and his penis and testicles swaying back and forth.

‘I came Baghdad!’ he cried to the soldiers (in ungrammatical Arabic) as he passed us by. The chief muleteer Halil Agha, who was a very upright person, said, ‘O Sheikh Bekkar, where is your gift from Baghdad?’

Sheikh Bekkar had both hands on his shoulders. With a besmele he pulled out a bunch of dates with his right hand. They were hastavi dates that seemed freshly picked from Rum-nahiye in Baghdad, a bunch weighing 40 Ottoman batmans.

‘This grew Baghdad,’ he said and gave the dates to the chief muleteer. Then he approached Murtaza Pasha and said with a smile, ‘O Murtaza, go Turkey then went Istanbul and went Erzurum, went etc., went to Baghdad and went to the land of the Kurds, died from the love of God, martyred in the castle of Dühük.’

No one had any idea what these mysterious words meant. Sheikh Bekkar turned toward Damascus and in a moment vanished like a shadow. The chief muleteer gave the Pasha the bunch of dates he had received from Sheikh Bekkar.

‘Praise God!’ said the Pasha, ‘they are hastavi dates of Baghdad, freshly picked.’ He gave them to this humble one in a copper bucket. I ate three of them as a blessing and kept the rest. I plan to give one to anyone suffering from epilepsy or paralysis.

God knows, this saintly deed of Sheikh Bekkar happened exactly as I have recounted it. To be sure, dates do grow in Damascus, but not productively, and hastavi dates of Baghdad grow nowhere else but there. Sheikh Bekkar one day previously was walking about and exchanging banter with us among the tents in Karalar castle, and the next day brought a bunch of hastavi dates to this place near İkikapulu. The strange thing is that none of the date palms – whether in Qurna, Jawazir, Samawat, Arja, Hilla, Baghdad or Damascus – was in flower. The miracles of the saints are true.

He was a great and naked saint, one suspected of miraculous graces – may his spiritual support be ever present. God be praised, I associated with such a great saint and received his benediction. Also this humble one had a tambourine in my house (i.e., while residing in Damascus?). Whenever he came to my house he would find the tambourine, put it in my hand and say ‘Play the tambourine,’ and as I played he would dance ecstatically.

He was originally from Baghdad where he was the muezzin at the (—) Friday mosque. One night while reciting temcid and seeing that the gate of God’s mercy was open, he flung himself from the minaret, disappeared from Baghdad, and appeared naked in Damascus.

He used to go about the marketplace naked. He would enter the women’s bath-houses, only a bath-towel around his loins, and rub the women down with soap and a bath-cloth. ‘The baby in your womb,’ he would say, ‘will be my daughter in this world and the next, or will be my son,’ and by God’s command the baby would be born precisely as he indicated.

One time he did this to the wife of a certain janissary colonel. After rubbing her down he placed his hand on her womb and said: ‘The baby boy in your womb will be my spiritual son and will go about like me.’ When the woman delivered, it was a boy like a gold piece, congealed light. Sheikh Bekkar showed up at the door and said ‘Give me my boy.’ Taking the baby in his arms he recited the call-to-prayer in its ear and puffed on its head, then returned it to its mother and left. By God’s wisdom, the newborn began to squirm and babble and refused any swaddling or any garment. Before he was three years old this son of the colonel began to go about naked alongside Sheikh Bekkar. Indeed, all his movements and gestures and attitudes are exactly those of Sheikh Bekkar. Only Sheikh Bekkar is not very talkative, but this spiritual son of his talks non-stop. He chats with anyone who catches his eye, and if there are no people he talks with animals and even with stones and trees. He is such a pure innocent child – may his spiritual support be ever present.





4. The girl who gave birth to an elephant





In the year 1059 (1649), while Silihdar Murtaza Pasha was governor of Sivas in the province of Rum, a delegation appeared before the Pasha from a village near Turhal. They had a box in which was the corpse of a white baby elephant. ‘My lord,’ they said, ‘this little elephant was born in our village of a girl who is a virgin maiden. Now our magistrate has imprisoned the girl along with her father and mother and other relatives. The baby elephant was born alive, but the prefect had the midwife smother it. We beg my lord to dispatch one of your agents, a fair-minded officer, to have the girl and her mother freed from prison and brought here so that you may determine the truth.’ The provincial councillors of Rum were amazed at the sight of this baby elephant.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ said Murtaza Pasha, ‘this is a job for you. Let’s bring all of them before the provincial council. Let’s see how a virgin maid can give birth to an elephant. This is a divine mystery. Go quickly, punish those who have committed this deed, and bring them before the council.’

I was nonplussed. ‘You tell me to punish those who have committed this deed. But the one who has committed this deed is the Free-choosing Actor, the Lord of the Worlds. He has done this in order to manifest His creative wisdom. Whom should I punish? My lord, I beg you not to reveal this mystery. The whole world will start to say that women in the Ottoman Empire give birth to elephants. Just ignore this case.’

Some of the Pasha’s companions spoke up: ‘My lord, there is an issue here of income and expenditure. The matter requires a strong and brave individual, one who fears neither God nor man, who will investigate why they had the elephant killed and will haul the murderers and all the villagers in chains before the council. If they had not killed the elephant, you might have sent it to Sultan Mehmed, who recently assumed the throne, and it would have been a gift the likes of which no previous sultan has received since the world has stood.’

They pointed to the elephant corpse in the box, marvelling at its ears and lips, its trunk and eyes, its tail and legs. ‘God be praised, my lord,’ they said. ‘You should exact 10,000 guruş from the person who smothered this innocent baby elephant, and 40,000 or 50,000 from the girl who bore it and from her parents.’ At their insistence a decree was drawn up and the head of the military band was ordered to go and summon all the villagers and the girl who had given birth to the elephant along with all of her relatives.

Three days later seventy individuals were brought before the provincial council in chains. The first to be questioned was the girl who had given birth to the elephant.

This was her story: ‘My lord. Three years ago a delegation from the sultan of India, bearing two elephants as a gift for Sultan Ibrahim, stopped in our plain of Turhal. All the townsfolk and the people from the surrounding villages went to see them. I was with a group of five or ten girls. We arrived at a pleasant spot and mounted some carts to get a better view. As they passed they cried, ‘You are too close, get down from the carts.’ Some of the women near me were whispering to each other, ‘Allah! what a big animal this is.’ I went forward, saying, ‘Mommy, where is the elephant?’ I saw a black house on five pillars. One of the pillars was swaying back and forth. I kept going forward, saying, ‘Mommy, where is the little elephant?’ Then I heard everyone shouting, ‘Hey, girl, stop!’ The next thing I saw was that big black house walking toward me. Something snatched me up in the air. I was in a dark warm place. I floundered about, crying for help, and my hands and feet kept sticking into warm flesh. Suddenly, after about an hour, something took hold of me and left me outside in the sunlight. I lay senseless for three hours, then they took me home. My belly began to swell. It got bigger day by day. Three years later I gave birth to this baby elephant. It was alive for one month. Then the midwife, urged on by the prefect, killed my elephant son. I demand justice.’

When she made this plea all the people of Turhal and Eynebazar and Kazova testified that it was so. Murtaza Pasha clapped the seventy individuals in chains and, keeping them confined for twenty days, got 20,000 guruş out of them. He also preserved the baby elephant in salt, planning to send it to the Felicitous Threshold (i.e. Istanbul).

These events occurred as I witnessed them, by divine mystery. God is capable of everything (2:20). The Free-choosing Actor wrought His eternal will in such a way that the elephant swallowed that virgin. She became pregnant by remaining in its belly for three hours, and a baby elephant was born. God does what He wills by His power and judges what He wishes by His might. This is clear proof of the wisdom of the Koranic verse: For His are the creation and the command; blessed be God, Lord of the Worlds (7:54).





5. Armenian





Language of the Armenians, called Soul of Yarmeni, an Ancient Community


This land of Sivas is an ancient city that has been in the hands of the Armenians ever since the time of its builder, Amalek. They trace their descent back to Esau, son of the prophet Isaac. They were a people of giants (or tyrants). According to their own claim, it was Amalek who created the Armenian language, which is spoken in its most elegant and refined form in the city of Sivas.

They belong to the Jacobite religious community. Since they believe in the Messiah, they are all Christians and followers of the Gospel. Furthermore, they are divided into seven sects and speak seven dialects. But being Christians, they all act according to the Gospel and recite the Gospel.

The Armenians of the Arab lands are called Jacobites, all of whom – in Damascus, Aleppo and Iraq – speak the Jacobite dialect and their false and unorthodox rituals are of a different sort; the Jacobite dialect is recorded in its place. The dialect of the Mighdisi people is a different dialect, of which some words and phrases are close to Persian; it is the most elegant of their dialects. The dialect of (—) is close to the language of the Kurds. The dialect of (—) is close to Arabic. The dialect of (—) is close to Georgian; these are Anushirvanis. The dialect of (—) does not resemble any other language; they are the Gypsies of the Armenians.

But they all follow the Gospel and belong to the Christian religious community. Only their false doctrines are not like those of the Greeks. The Armenians eat oily foods on the eve of the Christian Festival of the Egg (Easter), while the Greeks eat oily foods on the following morning, according to their false fast.

The world traveller and boon-companion of mankind greatly requires to know some of this Armenian language. Therefore this small amount has been recorded here so that he will know enough to get sustenance in the stages of his journey and in the villages and towns, and so that he will be on good terms with everyone he meets.

First are the numbers for counting in Armenian, which differ in the seven dialects: meg 1 erguk 2 erek 3 çors 4 hink 5 veç 6 yot 7 ut 8 inı 9 das 10 meg das 11 erguk das 12; asvas God haç bread çur water mis meat gavoh grapes çamic raisins eku Come! kına Go! nıste Sit! el Get up! kıni Sleep! hıncor apple zu kına per kari Hey, go bring barley çıka There isn’t any kına pındırdi Go look for some yur kıdınam Where shall I find some? lına kıdıni zu gınikıd kunem Go get some or I’ll fuck your wife zu kına Hey, come kurtank bostanı kini hmenk Come let’s go to the garden and drink wine ah imhokiz dıga O my dear boy ahbar eku inç kuzes imhokiz Brother, come, what do you want my dear? bahadır hist kezi kısirem My hero, I love you very much yes iz kezi kısirem I love you too eku ertank mer dunı Come let’s go to our house together bak mı dur inc bake ah dıga Give me a kiss O my dear boy vagı kıkum tun kini … I’ll come tomorrow, you get wine right now ez nıstenk hımenk Let’s sit and drink bahadur inc kıgına ez kişer kıgına eku kınik My hero, whatever happens will happen tonight, come let’s go to bed.





6. The cats of Divriği





Among the Turks and Arabs and Persians there is no cat more coy and cuddly or more trained to the hunt than this Divriği cat. True, the cats of Al Wahat (the oases in the Western Desert) in Egypt and those of Trabzon and Sinop are also famous. But this Divriği cat is fat and sturdy, with a shiny coat like sable fur, and comes in a thousand colours.

Indeed these cats are brought as gifts from Turkey to Persia, in particular to the city of Ardabil where they are sold at auction by cat-brokers who put them in cages on their heads and parade them around the royal market and the bedestan crying ‘One tuman, two tumans of akçe!’ The Divriği cat goes for a great price, especially if it is spayed. Because cats in Ardabil have short lives, and so the mice of that city are notorious. The Persians, to be sure, have round trim beards, but their moustaches are all mouse-eaten, and that is why Divriği cats are so expensive.

Cry of the Ardabil cat-brokers:

You who seek a feline,



A cat to hunt your mice:



To rats it makes a beeline,



But otherwise it’s nice;



An enemy to rodents,



And yet it’s not a thief;



A pet to share your grief.





This is their patter, sung in the beyati mode, as they peddle the Divriği cats in cages perched on their heads. Because in Ardabil the mice chew up the people’s clothing – their woolen cloaks, for example – and so this city has an auction for hirre, i.e. gürbe, i.e. kuta, i.e. sennure, i.e. merrabe, i.e. maçı and pistan and mistan – i.e. cats.

That is how famous Divriği cats are. But some of the kadis of Divriği have gone bankrupt because of these cats and so bear a grudge against them. Every year forty or fifty cats are secretly killed and their skins tanned and made into furs to be worn in the winter. They are very like the squirrel furs of Muscovy, and the cats with red coats are no different from the cıkava furs of Azov.





7. Witchcraft in a Bulgarian village





Adventure of Evliya the humble. In that mountainous Balkan region my servants and I were guests in the house of a certain infidel, and I was comfortably settled in a corner near the fire. Suddenly an old woman entered. She was very ugly, with her hair going in all directions, and was in a rage. She sat herself next to the fire and let out a stream of expletives in her peculiar dialect. From what I could understand, the servants outside had somewhat mistreated her. When I went out to scold them, they denied it. Then seven young children came in, male and female, and gathered about her, jabbering away in Bulgarian. They did not leave any place for me near the fire, so I observed the strange scene from a little distance (before falling asleep).

Around midnight I was awakened by some footsteps. What should I see? The old woman came inside, took a handful of ashes from the fireplace, and rubbed them onto her vagina. Then she recited a spell over the ashes left in her hand and scattered them over the seven little boys and girls who were lying naked next to the fireplace. At once all seven turned into plump chickens and started to go ‘cheep cheep’. She scattered the rest of the ashes over her own head and in an instant was transformed into a big broody hen going ‘gurk gurk’. She marched out the door with the seven chicks right behind.

‘Hey, boy!’ I shouted out, in a fright. My slaveboys awoke and came over, only to see that my nose was bleeding profusely. ‘What’s going on?’ I cried. ‘Go outside and see what that racket is.’ They rushed outside and saw that witch-hen and her brood of chickens marching about among our horses, which had got loose and were tearing at each other. This seemed unusual, since horses normally like chickens, and they also like pigs, and they are never affected by scrofula or red mite (when those animals are present), and that is why you never see farriers’ shops without chickens, or horse-driven mills without pigs, or wealthy people’s houses without Jews. But this time the horses were just tearing at each other, so some peasant infidels from the village had to come and tie them down. The bewitched hen and chickens went off. One of my slaveboys, who followed them, reported what happened next, ‘One infidel took out his penis and showered the chickens with a rain of piss. At once all eight of them turned back into their human form. The one who had urinated over them gave the old hag and the children a good beating and took them away. We followed them into a house, which turned out to be their church. He gave the woman over to a priest, and the priest anathematised her.’

My slaveboys swore that this account was true; and Antabi Müezzin Mehmed Efendi’s servants and my chief canteen-man’s servants also bore witness that they had seen human beings turn into chickens.

Whether out of fright, or because my blood was so excited, my nosebleed kept up all that night and only stopped toward dawn. In the morning I questioned my muezzin’s servants and also Mataracı Mehmed Agha’s servants. They swore that when the infidel pissed over the chickens they turned human, and they offered to bring the very man who did it. When the infidel was brought and I questioned him, he laughed and said: ‘My lord, that woman is a different breed. She used to turn into a witch once a year on a winter’s night, but this year she turned into a hen. She doesn’t harm anyone.’ He went away.

Such was the adventure that this humble one, full of fault, experienced in the above-mentioned village of Çalık-kavak. It really unnerved me.





8. Sofia





Description of the pure hot springs in the city of Sofia. In this country hot springs are called bana, in Persia germab, in Arabia humma, in Türkistan (i.e. Turkey) ılıca, in Yörükistan (i.e., among the Yörüks or Balkan nomads) kaplıca, among the Tatar ılışı, in Kürdistan çermik, in Serbian köstence, among the Türkman ılığın.

Here in Sofia there are five such hot springs. The first is the women’s bath – beneficial to women but not to men. If a man enters this bath he loses his hair and beard and is turned into a shiny-pated boy or a cevellaki dervish (i.e., one who shaves off all facial hair). But if a woman enters she loses all her body hair, including pubic hair, and the flesh around her vagina becomes as soft and smooth as her earlobes.

The second is reserved for Jewish and Christian women.

The third is reserved for Greeks, Latins, Bulgars and Armenians; other Christians are not permitted.

The fourth is only for Rabbinic Jews; all other religious communities are loath to enter it.

Each of these four baths has its own beneficial properties. But they are not imposing stone buildings. Also, the overflow from their pools forms streams that flow through the tanners’ quarters and are used for tanning.

The fifth one, the great hot spring, is in the middle of the city. It has a large domed dressing room – spacious enough for 1,000 men – and, in the middle, a pool and jetting fountain. Then one enters another domed space, so large you can hardly recognise someone on the other side. It has six vaults around the periphery, each with a Hanafi basin and water flowing from a spout in a stream as thick as your arm.

And there are two private chambers. One – called the White Chamber because it is paved with shining white marble – has a basin with the picture of a frog, as if to say, ‘You are human beings, don’t stay in the water too much like a frog.’ The other is called the Black Chamber, and indeed it is dark.

There is also a basin on the left side of the great pool called the Stopping Basin (Diner Kurna). If you stick your finger in a hole that is in the opposite wall, or just blow on the hole, the water stops flowing from the spout. Remove your finger, or stop blowing, and the water starts to flow again. It is a strange spectacle.

In the middle of this domed space is a large pool, ten-by-ten (cubits) in dimension and as deep as a man’s height, full to the brim with hot water. Six marble steps lead down to it on all sides, and fresh water flows into it from marble heads of dragons and lions. But the water is very hot. Lovers dally freely with their sweethearts in this pool. The bathers swim about like herons, leap and tumble, join hands and dance like dervishes or turn and croak like a flock of cranes. Or they huddle in a circle with some standing on others’ shoulders and turn in a circle with a great hue and cry.

I call this pool Lovers’ Lair because everyone here embraces his darling boy uninhibitedly and they can go off in a corner to dally undisturbed. It is such a spacious pool. Also there are numerous small basins in the changing-room where individuals may wash their garments. Others, meanwhile, are getting rubdowns with bath-gloves and soap. This gets them very clean, though some who don’t know the rules of ritual purity soil themselves (by ejaculating). It is altogether a marvellous scene, verging on mayhem.

In this bath there is no distinction between rich and poor. As long as you have a bath-cloth you can get out without giving the bath-keeper a single akçe. If you want him to guard your clothes, it costs a penny. This is worth it, since there is a mixed multitude of unsavoury individuals who come and go. If you don’t have a bath-cloth you can rent one from the bath-keeper and also get rubbed down with bath-gloves and soap for two akçe.

During the long winter nights seventy or eighty of the town notables rent this bana for a private party. The space is illuminated with hundreds of lamps and candles. They party until dawn while the city sleeps, having intimate conversations, enjoying delicious foods and musk-flavoured fruit drinks and the scents of rose-water and aloes-wood and ambergris.

The more sophisticated residents of Sofia make it a practice to fill clean jars with water from this bath and drink it when it cools, as it betokens the Water of Life. Generally the water of hot baths smells of sulfur and arsenic and tarnishes silver. This water, on the contrary, has no smell at all, nor does it tarnish metal but rather gives a shine to both silver and gold.

Bathing in this water is beneficial for leprosy, syphilis, scabies, jaundice, palpitations and baldness. Drinking it is good for diarrhoea, pleurisy and haemorrhoids. Entering it several times is a cure for fever. But there are certain rules. Sofia gets very cold in winter, so you must not stay too long in the hot bath, nor stay too long in the changing-room when you get out, for that could prove fatal. The first rule is to put on a shirt and trousers as soon as you exit the bath.

One delightful custom in Sofia is that when anyone dies, male or female, the water-carriers of his or her neighbourhood attach honey-barrels called çılır to poles and fill them up with hot water from the bana which is used to wash the body, and then it is buried, all at the expense of a pious foundation. On this occasion the soap combined with the hot water from the natural spring causes so much foam that it is like the water of Lake Van.

Another, less savoury, innovation has to do with the womenfolk of Sofia. They are covered and modest ladies who never go out into the marketplace unless there is a dire necessity. There are, however, several thousand loose women who do go out every night to ‘wash themselves’ or ‘do their laundry’. They put their clothes in a bundle, get permission from their so-called husbands, take lanterns and go to the bana or to some other house and ‘wash their soiled clothes’. It is a disgraceful practice, peculiar to this city. Our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha wanted to put an end to the practice but the notables of the province would not let him. So every night women of this sort gad about in groups until morning.

Another class of females are the very pretty Bulgar Voynuk girls employed here as household servants. Every house of the notables has five or ten, or at least one or two of these girls, who are called orfana. Elsewhere this term refers to prostitutes, but in Sofia it just means servant girl. You see these girls, with their faces uncovered, in the houses and in the markets, performing services very capably.

In short, these are the customs of old in this city. But going to the bana at night is most improper.

It was the martyr at Kosovo, Gazi Hudavendigar, who founded these hot springs. Due to his benevolence everyone here goes to the bana for free, which accounts for there being only two public baths in Sofia. The notables of the province do assert, however, that there are seventy private baths in the palatial residences of the city.

Description of the picnic grounds and great summer pasture of Mt Vitosh. The brethren of purity should know that of all the summer pastures and lofty mountains in the Anatolian region, the greatest is Mt Alburz around the countries of Dagestan and Persia and Georgia and Circassia and towering over the Caspian Sea. Next is the great summer pasture of Bingöl overlooking the Erzurum region, as we recounted above in Volume 236 when discussing the summer pastures of Anatolia that number (—) in toto.

But now in Rumelia we observed this lofty mountain pasture of Vitosh, one day’s journey from Sofia, where I came to spend the month of July with seventy companions. Having climbed to the most flourishing site we set up our tents and busied ourselves with picnics, parties and pleasure excursions.



The peak of this mountain is the summer-pasture for Salonica, Kavala, Serrez, Zihne – in short, all the cities of Rumelia. Flocks of sheep numbering in the hundreds of thousands spend seven months of the year here. From these sheep we got over 100 lambs to make into kebabs.

And every day we feasted on trout that we caught in the lakes and cooked in butter. There are fish here weighing six or seven okkas the likes of which are not found in the summer pastures of Bin Göl, Göksün or Ramazanoğlu. There are ruby-coloured gold-sprinkled musk-scented trout, as well as carp and fish known as şibe and dilçe that are found here and nowhere else.

Another speciality of the region are the sour cherries growing on a kind of squat shrub. There are also strawberries and, in the lower valleys, chestnuts, wild pears, sour plums, medlars and rowanberries. Day and night we drank sour-cherry juice cooled with pieces of ice like crystal.

According to the local authorities there are on this mountain 3,000 sheepfolds called eğrek or saya. The shepherds – Serbian and Bulgarian and Voynuk infidels – live in long huts that resemble caravel galleons and their daughters are Bulgarian mountain beauties. There are lovely boys as well, but the plump and ruddy girls of the Yörüks and Çıtaks and the other country bumpkins win the beauty-prize of the Franks.

We stayed for five days in the Yörük tents savouring their milk and cream and yoghurt, curds and whey and buttermilk and beestings and cheeses, and their butter-baked breads and pastries, and other such light-fare specialities of these summer pastures, and fattening ourselves on roasted lamb.

In sum, we spent a total of forty days among the Yörüks and Çıtaks, going from tent to tent and savouring the regional delights. Eventually we got a Yörük guide to take us back to Sofia. He told us about a fountain nearby, springing from the rocks, called the Fountain of Luck (Tali‘ Çeşmesi). ‘Go try your luck there,’ he said, and took us through that valley. As we were making our way on that difficult road, Refi‘izade Şefi‘i Çelebi, who was from Sofia, spoke up, ‘Do you know what the Fountain of Luck is that this old Yörük is taking us to?’

‘No,’ we replied, ‘we’ve never heard of it.’





Description of the Fountain of Luck, the Spring of Plato the Divine


‘Listen, O brethren of loyalty,’ said Şefi‘i Çelebi. ‘It is a fountain of pure water that refuses to flow for any man who has ever committed murder, or any man who was sodomised in his youth. But any man who is clean-skirted can drink freely from that Water of Life. If you can’t get water from it you will be shamed and blamed among your peers. Is it a good idea to go to such a fountain?’

Some of our companions started teasing him, ‘Şefi‘i Çelebi has been a homeless vagrant for the past forty days. He’s anxious to get home and make up the Friday night prayers he missed and dally with the beauties of Sofia.’

‘Let the mare that mothered you feel shame,’ said Şefi‘i Çelebi, stung by their taunts. ‘Whoever doesn’t go is an old woman. Onward, father Yörük, show us the way!’

So we proceeded toward the Fountain of Luck. But most of our companions began to complain that the road was hard or the road was long. Finally, having arrived at that Water of Life, we dismounted in a shady grove and set up camp.





Adventure of the brethren of purity. Before us was a sheer cliff rising to the sky and a pure stream flowing out of the rocks. The group urged one another on, and withdrew to this corner and that to consult, but no one would dare approach to drink. Finally Şefi‘i Çelebi said: ‘God be praised, I know that I have been innocent and pure in all respects, from the time I was a child until now.’ So he came forward, uttering a besmele, fearlessly drew some pure water from the spring, and drank it.

Next to dare was Müezzinzade Ali Çelebi. Taking up his wooden begging-bowl, he reached out for the water, but suddenly the spring stopped flowing. Everyone made fun of him, crying, ‘You’re a catamite.’ The poor fellow turned pale and couldn’t say a word.

Now the party started quarrelling, some claiming that they had drunk but the others could not, some saying ‘Let’s drink,’ others saying ‘Let’s go.’ Eventually they all swore not to reveal what happened, and began to draw water one by one.

When Şefi‘i Çelebi’s brother approached, as soon as he stretched out his hand the water stopped flowing, and again the others started to make fun.

Then there was Hımhım Mehmed Çelebi, who was Şeyhzade Çelebi’s boy: the spring stopped while he was still ten paces from it. They all burst out laughing: ‘This one must have been sodomised quite a lot!’

Resmi Çelebi uttered a besmele and drank without hesitation.

When Muhzırzade approached, the water stopped but then began flowing again and he drank – a sequence that the others in the party did not know how to interpret.

Now one of my slaveboys came forward and fearlessly took a drink. Immediately all the party fixed their attention on me and insisted that I too should drink.

‘O friends and lovers,’ said I, ‘you know that I am a world-traveller, free and easy and friends with all. Please don’t force me to do this.’ The more I objected, the more they laughed and kept pressing me, ‘You have seen how it stands with us, now let’s see about you!’

Of course, I was aware of my own situation; still, I couldn’t shake off a nagging fear. Seeking spiritual succour from my great ancestor, Turk of the Turks, the saintly Hoca Ahmed Yesevi, I took up the begging-bowl with a besmele, drew some pure water from the spring, and drank it. My friends all rejoiced.

Now Sarrac Mehmed Çelebi drew water and drank, thanking God.

Then it was the turn of the old Yörük who had brought us to the spring. He expressed misgivings, saying, ‘Children, my luck is bad, the water might stop’ – and indeed, he was unable to draw from the spring.

‘Hey old man,’ they joked, ‘you’re a catamite too!’

The upshot was that seventy individuals tried to drink from the spring at this bare rock, and only five were able to do so. It is a strange and wondrous spring, under a talismanic spell. No one could fathom the mystery of this fountain.

The next day we entered Sofia, having been absent forty-one days.

[…]





A marvellous and noteworthy spectacle. Upon the lead-tiled roof of the ancient Friday mosque named the Çelebi Mosque, which is in front of the Pasha’s palace in the city of Sofia, a pair of storks made their nest and deposited their eggs.

One day a notorious rogue named Debbağoğlu (‘son of the tanner’) climbed up to the roof of this mosque, removed the stork eggs, and put crow eggs in their place. Eventually these hatched and two crow chicks emerged, according to the verse:

If you put crow eggs beneath a blessed peacock



What hatches are crows, despite a thousand schemes.





When the father stork returned from his foraging, what should he see but two black crow chicks squirming in the nest. He gave the mother stork a sound drubbing with his beak, then flew up and began to cry and wail as he soared about over the entire city of Sofia. Thousands of storks assembled and flew straight to Çelebi Mosque, landing on the domes and covering the roof so that you could not see a single lead tile.

All these birds came forward one by one to peer into the nest and take a look at the grafted crow chicks. They raised such a hue and cry on the mosque dome that it frightened the wits of the passers-by. None of the birds ate or drank that day; they just kept up their crowing and cawing. So there was no peace of mind in Sofia on that day. All the people stopped what they were doing to watch the storks.

Finally the crowd of storks killed the crow chicks. Then they rushed upon the mother stork, accusing her of adultery, and cut her to pieces with their beaks. After some further stork talk they gave the father stork another mother stork as his mate, and all flew back to their own nests.

The townsfolk marvelled at this incident, and our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha too was quite astounded. ‘Have that scoundrel who exchanged the eggs brought here immediately,’ he said, ‘we’ll punish him.’ But then he decided to bide his time saying, ‘Be patient, God almighty will punish that rogue as he deserves.’

A few days later – by God’s wisdom – that notorious outlaw who had exchanged the stork eggs – he was a Segban servant named Uşkurta Debbağoğlu – was tipsy and went to visit his lady friend. Just as he was shuttling on her loom like a master weaver, the lady’s husband suddenly entered and saw that the workshop was in full swing. This householder bared his sword in a fit of zealous rage, rushed upon his wife and on Uşkurta Debbağoğlu, and led them outside wounded and manacled, crying, ‘See, O people of Muhammad!’

When they reached Bana-başı, the gathering place of Sofia’s mystics and lovers, some Zadra janissaries were squabbling over a woman, and it turned out that this woman was the original whore of that very Debbağoğlu who had exchanged the stork eggs. So now Debbağoğlu freed himself from his captor and began trying to rescue his whore. In the midst of the struggle the janissaries bared their swords and cut up both Debbağoğlu and his whore, and left them in Bana-başı.

A band of youthful tanners from the town brought Debbağoğlu’s corpse to the Pasha’s palace, crying, ‘The janissaries killed our Çelebi, here is his corpse!’ Since the Pasha was rather displeased at this plea for justice, the tanner youths put Debbağoğlu’s corpse under the eaves of the mosque in front of the Pasha’s palace.

So you see the divine plan! Because this Debbağoğlu took the stork eggs and put crow eggs in their place, when the crows hatched, all the birds cut the female stork to pieces and dropped them from the eaves of the mosque. A few days later – according to the verse,

Avenger is one name of the Eternal One





– God had him cut to pieces, as well as his whore in place of the female stork, and had them leave Debbağoğlu’s corpse in the very place where the storks had left the stork. For God is just.

When the Pasha heard of this he said, ‘I ought to have punished him, but I cast him to God, and a few days later God punished him. He got what he deserved. Have that damned fellow’s corpse removed from the courtyard of the mosque, shrouded in a mat, and buried.’ So the tanner brigands took away the hide of the tanner’s son and brought it to Bana-başı to be tanned. It was quite a spectacle. Many moral lessons can be drawn from this event.

After the Debbağoğlu affair our lord the Pasha banished all the prostitutes of Sofia from the town. A few of them, by leave of the Sharia and for the reform of the world, were strung up like chandeliers to adorn the town at the street corners in the silk market. The notables of the province were grateful that their town was now tranquil and free of prostitutes. But the rogues and the brigands, for the sake of their carnal pleasures, bruited it about that the town’s resources had grown scarce, and there would now be famine and dearth, even plague.

And indeed – by God’s wisdom – the plague did begin to spread in the city from day to day. By the end of a month, 500 people, men and women, were dying from it daily. It reached the point that thousands of people fled from Sofia to other regions. Seventy-seven of our fortunate lord’s renowned aghas, among his highest officers, died. The Pasha too had to take to his bed from illness. His head swelled up like an Adana squash, his tongue was scorched and turned black, his ears oozed with pus. More than once he was on the verge of death.





(Melek Pasha recovers from his illness, but is dismissed from office.)

36 The reference to ‘Volume 2’ (cild-i sanimiz) must be to an earlier redaction of the Book of Travels. As we have the text now, the listing of Anatolian summer pastures is found in Vol. 3, fol. 89a, that of Rumelian summer pastures in Vol. 3, fol. 18b. Cf. Dankoff 2004, 55.





VOLUME FOUR





Safavid Borderlands





IN MARCH 1655, Evliya sets out to join Melek Ahmed Pasha at his new post in Van. On the way he stops in Diyarbekir and then Bitlis, where he and Melek Pasha are entertained by the flamboyant, quasi independent Kurdish ruler, Abdal Khan. (With regard to the acrobatic performances, cf. Volume 10, selection 11 for similar entertainments in Egypt.) Evliya’s travels in the region include a visit to the ancient city of Ahlat.

Once in Van, Melek Pasha finds an excuse to mount an expedition against Abdal Khan and to reassert Ottoman authority in Bitlis. Evliya is once again sent on an embassy to Tabriz. While in Urmia he deals with the slanderous rumours about ‘extinguishing the candle’. After some jaunts in Azerbaijan and Western Persia, he takes the opportunity to travel to Baghdad and makes an extensive tour of Iraq and Kurdistan.





1. Diyarbekir





On the royal covered bazaar. Altogether 2,008 shops constitute the well-built area of the bazaar, the Market of Beauty. Firstly, there is the bazaar of Hasan Pasha, then the army bazaar, the druggists’ bazaar – the brains of those who pass through it are scented with perfumes – and the goldsmiths’ bazaar. All these bazaars are constructed with vaults of fitted stone, huge as the Vault of Chosroes.

Further, there is the market of the blacksmiths, the bazaar of the locksmiths, the bazaar of jewellers and goldsmiths, the bazaar of the boot makers, the saddlers’ bazaar, the bazaar of the silk manufacturers and the bazaar of the traders in cloth. In short, there are shops of 366 different trades and crafts. But the market hall in the army bazaar is a well-kept, beautifully ornamented solid building of fitted stone, with iron gates on both ends. It is crowded with the richest merchants, and one finds here valuable goods of the highest quality and the most expensive sorts of jewellery from all countries.

Swords, scimitars, maces, axes, arrows, daggers, spear-blades and arrowheads such as those forged hereabouts are made nowhere else, except perhaps by the weapon-smiths of Isfahan.

The Armenian blacksmiths, while beating their hammers and pumping their bellows, sing songs with their fine voices – kâr and nakş, zecel and tasnifat – thus earning their profit (kâr) while singing songs (kâr). And their servants strike their hammers in twenty-four different rhythmic patterns – beating a tirtaka tirtak tirtirtak in the double two-one (çifte dü-yek) meter – and pump their bellows in the sofiyane meter.

When the cotton carders beat the cotton, the strings of their carding bows produce sounds in various musical modes, some in segah, others in dügah or yekgah. The meter is ‘bow’s hoop’ (yay çemberi) or else ‘heavy’ (sakil) which is: tırtaka tırtakataka tırtaka tırtırtak tırtak tak tırtaka tırtırtak tırtak tırtırtak.

The kettle makers, working in a group of twelve, hammer the red copper on their anvils in the sofiyane metre of tañ taña tañ taña. Even musical experts are struck with amazement when they hear the hüseyni melody produced by their hammers and observe their metrical motion.

Such is the degree to which the artisans here are perfect masters in every respect. Unrivalled masters as well are the jewellers and goldsmiths making silver vessels and golden headgear and bejewelled vessels of pure gold. And the embroiderers are as accomplished in the art of multi-coloured designs as the painters Mani, Bihzad and Arzhang.

Description of the excursion spots of Diyarbekir the unparalleled.


We have described all such far-famed parks that we have seen, as the Meram garden of Konya in the country of Rum-ı Yunan, the Istanaz garden in Antalya, the Fayyum garden in Egypt, the Manjik garden in Damascus, the Darende garden in Darende, the Aspuzu garden in Malatya. But Diyarbekir’s basil garden and regularly laid out vegetable plots on the bank of the Tigris have no equal in Turkey or Arabia or Persia.

In spring, when the flood period of the Tigris has passed and its limpid waters begin to flow again in a stable current, all Diyarbekir’s inhabitants, rich and poor alike, move with their entire families to the bank of the Tigris. They set up camp with their tents and pavilions along this wide water, on plots they have inherited from their fathers and ancestors, and cultivate their gardens with melons, watermelons, various vegetables and flowers.

They cultivate here a special type of basil that everyone plants along the borders of his plot. In a month’s time it becomes thick as a forest and tall as a spear, impenetrable to the glance. All their humble houses along the bank of the Tigris have their doors and walls and roofs made out of basil. The basil stems remain rooted in the earth and the leaves remain green and continue to grow finding moisture in the soil. It is impossible to see from one house to the next through these walls of basil. The huts are so overgrown that the brains of the men and women living in them are perfumed night and day with the fragrance of basil and the other flowers in these gardens, such as roses, Judas trees and hyacinth. The women’s quarters of each garden pavilion are also such pleasure-huts of basil. And each hut has a pool and fountain drawing water from the Tigris which is diverted into numerous tributaries and canals that flow among the gardens.

Here on the bank of the Tigris there is a merry tumult day and night, with music and song, for a full seven months. Everyone parties in his hut with his lovers and friends, enjoying the delights of Husayn Bayqara. The artisans, however, are not idle during this garden season. Thousands go to the city (in the morning) and pursue their occupations, and return to their gardens in the late afternoon where food and drink are stored and they can indulge in pleasure and enjoyment.

The melons that grow in these gardens have no match, except perhaps the melons of Bohtan in the province of Van. The Diyarbekir melons are huge, very juicy and sweet, and with a delicious aroma as of musk and ambergris. If you eat one of them the fragrance of melon will not leave your brain for an entire week. There is even a tradition among the ulema of Kurdistan and the scholars of Soranistan that Abu Bakr the Faithful exuded a fragrance like that of melon; and the ulema of Diyarbekir claim that this can only be their Tigris melon. The aroma is such that the brain of one who eats it or just smells it is imbued with ambergris.

Some of these melons attain a weight of 40 or 50 okkas. They all have a green colour. People take them as presents to various countries, as far as they remain fresh. Some people use them to prepare zerde (a yellow-rice dish), flavoured with cinnamon and cloves, according to the recipe of the Caliph Mu‘awiya. Not even Athens honey could make a zerde so fragrant as this dish is with Diyarbekir melons.

The watermelons, however, do not deserve much praise. The basil on the other hand grows into such huge trees that in seven or eight months they can be used as tent-poles or stakes, and when one burns them in a fire they smell like Chinese hyacinth.

In short, the people of Diyarbekir are the envy of the world for the delights they enjoy for seven or eight months of the year along the bank of the Tigris; when their nights are like the Night of Power, and their days like the holiday of the Festival of Sacrifice; holding concerts worthy of Husayn Bayqara; and thinking to snatch a bit of pleasure from this transitory world.

Every night the bank of the Tigris is illuminated with oil lamps, lanterns, wind tapers and torches. They place boards on the water with oil lamps and wax candles arranged in a thousand artful ways so the lights float from one end to the other and dark night is turned into brilliant day. In each hut are singers and musicians, clowns and minstrels and story-reciters, players of various instruments.37 They perform until the break of dawn like the musicians at Bayqara’s court. Then the muezzins with their sorrowful voices chant the glories of God, and the mystics and lovers recite their litanies. Since the people of Diyarbekir all belong to the Hacegan (Naqshbandi) and Gülsheni orders, they do not miss the ecstatic joy and delight of the ritual chantings.

In sum, as such busy intercourse and buzzing conversation go on in this garden of Iram, the people continually pray for the welfare of the imperial state. May God elevate their station.

37 Mentioned in the text are: lute, four- and six-string guitar, berbut (a kind of lute), kanun (zither), çeng (harp), rebab (three-stringed violin), musikar (panpipe), tambur (pandore lute), santur (zither), nefir (trumpet), balaban (shawm), ney (reed flute), and dehenk (?).





2. Bitlis





The meeting of Melek Ahmed Pasha and the noble Khan for the purpose of the bounteous feast. At this juncture, in those rough steep regions, the Khan of Bitlis, Abdal Khan, appeared with his soldiery. Dismounting, he rushed over and was about to kiss the Pasha’s stirrup when the Pasha too dismounted from his zephyr-swift steed, and the two of them embraced and kissed. After much conversation, the Khan said: ‘Please mount and go a little ahead where you will have a breakfast.’ The Pasha mounted and proceeded with great ceremony, playing his eightfold band, until we came upon a meadow in a valley, a veritable tulip garden of brightly coloured tents: derim obas in Persian, Turkman, and Kurdish style; Persian ten-getirs; and Ottoman baldachins. The Pasha came to that delightful spot and alighted at the Khan’s pavilion.

At once an enormous spread was served, with golden and silver dishes and porcelain and onyx and celadon bowls. Such a bounteous and delicious banquet no latter-day sultan has given since the time of Jamshid and Iskandar and Kay Kavus. As God is my witness, there was enough to feed the 3,000 soldiers of our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha, and the 3,000 retainers of the Khan, as well as the town notables who had come out to meet us, and the swarms of Kurdish vermin in the surrounding districts. Aside from this, thousands of vessels of food of every sort were spilled out on the grass. When it was time to leave, the noble Khan bowed before the Pasha, as did his twelve sons and the seventy-seven tribal chieftains who were submissive to him.

‘My lord,’ said the Khan, ‘please regard with favour and accept the seven pavilions where you have alighted; also the fifty silver dishes and hundred porcelain and celadon bowls, and all the carpets and vessels, plus four each of Circassian, Abkhazian, and Georgian slaveboys.’ And he kissed his hand. The Pasha removed a sharp-pointed dagger from his own belt, one of Sultan Murad’s daggers, and with his own hands fastened it to the Khan’s waist. He also gave a sable cloak to the Khan, three fur pieces to his children, and 170 gold-embroidered robes of honour with sashes to the Khan’s attendants. Then mounting his fleet courser and playing his band, he proceeded over hill and dale toward the town of Bitlis.





Meanwhile all the Khan’s attendants had gathered about someone and were proceeding amidst a great deal of laughter and joking. I went ahead, wondering what all the commotion and jesting were about.





A strange scene. There was a Kurd, of strange and wondrous aspect, hideously ugly, with a turban so tall it could serve as a sparrow’s nest; a flaming beard— yellow, red, blue, green and white – reaching down to his belt; and mounted on an emaciated horse. In his hand he held a huge snake, and he was beating the poor King and Beggar 38 beast with it as with a whip. The horse put one foot forward, but seemed to have the other foot in the grave. Spittle ran down its mouth like a fountain, the eyes were completely lustreless, the legs were like sprigs of mint, the bones stuck out so they could be counted one by one. It tottered left and right like a drunken man. On each haunch hung two sacks of barley, but the poor beast had one foot in the grave. This merry fellow, meanwhile, kept striking the meagre animal’s belly with his stirrup, or whipping it with the snake, hopping off and remounting, and doing all sorts of acrobatic tricks, so that the people roared with laughter.

One of the Khan’s servants, named Kurban Ali, gave him a gold piece. ‘Molla Mehmed, my dear fellow,’ he said, ‘let us see you put this stallion through its paces.’

‘Hey my mystical friend,’ said I, ‘if you keep putting it through its paces, it will take its final pace to the Hereafter!’ Suddenly he scrambled up the craggy rocks and flew past the Khan and the Pasha like lightning on that emaciated horse. All the Pasha’s men were dumbstruck with amazement, but the Khan’s soldiers merely laughed. Then, coming at full speed from the opposite direction, and spurring his horse from rock to rock, he passed through like thunder and re-entered the Khan’s soldiery.

I rushed over to the fellow and looked at the horse’s face and eyes to see if it was panting. Its eyes were still lustreless, but it was not panting, nor even standing still, but prancing about and chomping at the bit. Examining this emaciated beast more closely, I found no sign of its being either a stallion or a mare, or a gelding – just nothing! While I was praising God and marvelling at this mystery, the rider smiled and addressed me thus, ‘Mister, why are you looking so much? Do you want to buy it? This is my horse, which has come down to me from my forefathers. Even if your Pasha wanted it, I would not give it to him. The whole world could not come up with its price.’ He grew quite heated.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ said the chief taster, Mustafa, ‘what do you think of this emaciated horse? It was a log in a pile at the stokehold of the Khan’s bath. The Khan refused to give this Molla a horse to ride in the parade, and warned him, saying, ‘You will make a mockery of my procession in view of Melek Ahmed Pasha’s procession, so do not join the parade!’ The Molla got offended. He went straight to the stokehold and put a spell on that log, which turned into an emaciated horse, and he mounted it and performed the tricks you saw. But now the Khan is quite irritated. He is worried that your Pasha will get wind of the fact that this horse was produced through sorcery, and will think that the Khan has people who practice sorcery and alchemy and magic.’

I was at a loss. ‘My dear chief taster,’ I said, ‘for the love of the Prophet, what do you say about this?’

‘By the pure and noble spirit of Evhadehullah,’39 he swore, ‘it is this way: that Molla is one of the holy Friends, a jokester and a trickster. He can mount a pole or a trough, a jar or a sheepskin, or else a log such as this, utter a spell, and ride on it wherever he wishes. And if he mounts a cat or a sheep or a dog or other animal, he can make it dance and can play jereed on it as though it were Ali’s mount Duldul or a rose-bodied Arabian steed.’

‘I don’t believe it, I must get to the bottom of this mystery,’ said I, and requested the taster to help me.

‘Come with me,’ he said. We followed Molla Mehmed at a distance and came to the Khan’s Garden. The Molla entered the garden through the back gate and, supposing that no one else was around, went straight into the stokehold. I got off my horse and watched him with my three servants. He dismounted, put the snake that he was holding inside his trousers, and squatted down. Then he took a waistband from his trousers, fastened it round the emaciated horse’s neck, and let out a tremendous shout. It turned somewhat dark, and my eyes dimmed. When I could see again, there was a log with branches and stems right in the middle of the stokehold.

‘So,’ said the chief taster, addressing the Molla, ‘You have re-attached the courser to the stokehold.’

‘That lousy so-called khan would not give me a horse,’ he replied, ‘and so I did this. By God, I should have mounted the court sweeper Bağdu Kafir, but the Ottoman procession came and I thought they would make fun of me, so I mounted this log.’ He did not deny a thing.

‘Who are these?’ he asked, meaning myself. The chief taster had just made acquaintance. ‘He is a hafız and the Pasha’s boon companion,’ he said. The Molla was very pleased, and we became friends. God willing, I will relate below many more of his marvellous skills.

Meanwhile our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha entered the town of Bitlis with a great procession and was greeted on every side by the populace coming out to meet him. He showered on them a huge amount of gold pieces and shiny silver coins. With such pomp and ceremony he came to the noble Khan’s Garden, where he was put up as guest, and he ordered a ten-day halt.

[…]

We spent the ten-day halt in his palace with our lord the Pasha. Each day from dawn to dusk there was a constant stream of musicians and buffoons and acrobats, displaying their wares and receiving gifts from the Khan and the Pasha. Because of the Khan’s reputation as patron of the arts and sciences, skilled men would come to him from every country, and if they were well-rounded and cultivated individuals, the Khan would give them gardened palaces and slavegirls and timars and dye works in order that he might keep them tied down in the valley of Bitlis and so acquire some of their skills. Thus the Khan became a second Jamshid, spending all his free time learning new skills. And thus the city of Bitlis was filled with skilled masters.

As for the master players on the shawm and the trumpet and the kettle drum and the cymbals in the Khan’s band, their like is not to be found in the imperial workshop itself, let alone in that of a vizier. For he himself performs concerts and is knowledgeable in the various musical sciences. And he has masters in his band who perform küll-i külliyat, zencir in the twenty-four rhythmic cycles, şükufezar, and peşrevs in the saba mode and the zarb-i fetih rhythmic cycle. Each one is like Jamshid who invented the shawm. When they perform in the evening, or in the pre-dawn when no one is stirring, they delight the listener.

The Khan’s pleasure garden. On the harem side of this garden palace there is a garden as long and broad as the range of a bow-shot. If the seas were ink and the trees were pens, and all the scribes gathered, they could not record a drop in the ocean or a mote in the sunlight of due description and praise of this garden. Suffice it to say that all the fruit-bearing trees are planted in rows, each one swaying with the zephyr breeze like beauties with girded loins. Aside from the fig, the sycamore, the banana, and the cypress, all varieties are present. In some nooks and crannies there are even lemon and orange saplings which are protected with felt coverings during the winter. There are also charming and lavish pleasure-domes, like so many castles of Khawarnaq, each one different in style from the others, and each the work of a master of a different land.

The pools and jets and fountains here are not to be found in Turkey. Each pool is surrounded by a mosaic floor of varicoloured marble, like Indian-style mother-of-pearl and marquetry inlay. Streams of water as thick as a man’s neck flow into the pools from the mouths of various demons, lions, and dragons; then pour down into the reticulated garden beds. There is also water springing up from jets. In certain cases, forty or fifty streams jet out of a single hole and mingle together like a beauty’s tresses. The marvellous thing is that they all issue from one mouth. Some of the pleasure-domes have suspended glass and crystal bowls, which give a melancholy sound when the water jets strike them, while the larger ones channel the water so that it cascades like rain. Some of the jets have a wheel suspended above, which turns when the jet stream strikes. Others have a hollow ball the size of a watermelon, which turns and bobs in the air. In short, the master craftsmen of every land have created such wonders that the tongue cannot express.

There are beds with thousands of flowers of various sorts, including rose, hyacinth, sweet basil, violet, judas tree, jonquil, nebati (?), camel’s nose (deve boynı, a type of iris), camphor tree, peony, Roman musk (müşk-i rumi, a wildflower in the hyacinth family), carnation, syringa, lily, iris, narcissus, cyclamen, jasmine, tulip, and hollyhock. Each bed is laid out differently, and they intoxicate with the scent of jonquils and other blossoms. As for the varieties of fruit trees, there are saplings from as far away as Isfahan, Tabriz, and Nakhchivan. Even though this garden was constructed only recently, when Sultan Murad IV saw it during the Revan campaign, he was astounded.

The Khan’s artificial lake. Behind the aforementioned garden on the northern side there was a flowing spring called Ayn-i Taklaban. The Khan dammed up the lower part of the stream and made a sea-like lagoon. The dam is like the Wall of Iskandar or the Wall of Magog, and myriad fishes swim in the lake. The Khan had caiques constructed and decked out, and he himself used to row alone, or else he would take his household out for excursions, thereby dissipating his longing for the sea.

One day, by God’s wisdom, the women were not sitting properly in the caique and it capsized, leaving several slavegirls drowned. After that he gave up the sport, only occasionally going fishing. The lake is very deep. Once, when the flood waters were severe, one side of the dam broke and the rushing waters destroyed quite a few houses in the Taklaban quarter. When the Kurds cursed the Khan, wishing that he too would be ruined, he reconstructed all of their houses.

The garden bath. A delightful bath goes off the treasury room of the above-mentioned Khan’s palace, and gives onto a dressing-room. It has gardens on three sides, and the dressing-room has windows overlooking the gardens, all with bronze and iron grating like Fahri cutouts, also shutters of Arab-style carved (wood), which the khans of Persia sent from Tabriz as gifts. The shutter carvings are filled in with raw black ambergris, and as the zephyr breeze strikes them from without, the men within enjoy the fragrance.

All four walls of this dressing-room are covered with varicoloured porcelain tiles. And going all around the lofty dome and over the upper sills of the windows, in calligraphy written enchantingly on the tiles by the hand of Muhammad Riza of Tabriz, is Fuzuli’s ‘Bath Kaside’.40 The couplets inscribed there are as follows:

[3 lines empty]

In the very centre of this dressing-room are fountains full of water shooting toward the dome from 300 places. Its floor is paved with Egyptian-style varicoloured marble. The jet in the centre of the pool strikes the glass bowl at the peak of the dome and then rains down. All the servants here are lovely Circassian, Abkhazian and Georgian pages, each outfitted with a jewelled belt worth 1,000 guruş, adorned with daggers and knives, and walking about on clogs with inlaid mother-of-pearl, like so many peacocks of paradise. They give the bathers silk waist-wrappers and clogs like their own, and serve them respectfully.

When one enters the bath from the dressing-room, one finds oneself in a large domed room called the tepidarium (sovukluk), but the water of the pools and fountains in the middle of this room is all hot, and the walls are all covered with varicoloured tiles. The floor here too is paved with marble mosaic ‘China-rose’ while the sturdy enamel dome is brightened by porcelain tiles and ornamented with numerous chandeliers.

The next room is the caldarium (hammam-ı germa). It is as though one entered a pool of light, for there is no sign of a wall rising on all sides to the lofty dome. Rather, this great round dome is perched on tall columns, and between the columns are windows of clear and polished rock crystal and cut glass. When the sun strikes the windows, the inside of the bath become light upon light (24:35). In the garden of Iram outside these windows a thousand nightingales wail and cry, as the bathers within listen and watch them feed their chicks, and observe the flowering trees and the singing birds’ nests and the tall and brightly coloured flowers arrayed on the ground.

In the middle of this bath is a large pool with jets spouting up on all sides, the jet in the centre reaching as high as the bowl in the dome and then pouring down into the hot water. Ruby-coloured petals of rose and carnation are floating in the pool and stick to the bathers’ skin, imparting their perfume. Each cubicle has a two-jar sarcophagus bath. This room also is paved with marble that dazzles the eye, since it is inlaid with precious stones, like the eye of a bird: jade, onyx, amber, fish-eye, Yemenite agate, and garnets. And attached to the columns that are between the windows are washbasins of onyx, porphyry, yerekan stone, ferah stone, and Chinese porcelain, carved to such perfection that the marble cutters of today could not even strike a chisel at it. The craftsmen made the water flow out of the marble columns into the basins in a marvellous manner. All the spouts are gold and silver, the bowls as well, and the jet pipes are pure silver. The atmosphere is so delightful that one seems to be enjoying eternal life. As the fountain streams strike the various chandeliers and wheels and suspended crystal bowls, they turn in the air, which is also a rare sight. On the lower level of this dome are fine calligraphic inscriptions with verses relating to the bath. Lovely slaveboys, with silken indigo waistbands wrapped round their naked bodies, service the bathers with fütuni bath gloves and scented soaps. When they loosen their tresses, the distraught lover goes out of his mind. Some of them light censers and incense-burners with aloes and ambergris, so the bath is filled with fragrance.

In sum, the tongue falls short in describing this bath, or the grand palace, or the garden of Iram. For in the expenditure of filigree-work in these buildings, and in grace and elegance and cleanliness, it is a peerless bath of unique design whose like I have not seen in forty-one years of travel.

The master builder in each of his works brought forth such marvels of art that no former architect under the sun achieved such a construction. Only God knows what it cost to make such a wondrous mansion. Even Sultan Murad (IV), during the Revan campaign, when he entered this bath and found the cold water flowing with rose-water, and the hot with steam; and in one cubicle five lovely male attendants with black tresses, and in another five fairy-graced and angel-faced virgin maiden attendants; – even he exclaimed with delight: ‘If only this bath were in my palace!’ It is truly a wonderful and charming bath. When our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha entered it, he remarked: ‘No bath like this has ever been seen on earth.’

The Khan’s feast for Melek Ahmed Pasha. When the Pasha emerged from this bath, a sumptuous feast was spread out in his honour, in the arena, according to the Khan’s regulation. 200 silver platters, full of culinary delights, ornamented the arena, their delicate odours perfuming the brains of those attending. There were numerous kinds of pilavs – kükü (omelette), saffron, çilav (plain boiled rice), twelve roasted meats, mulberry, şille (?), pomegranate, aloes, ambergris, rice-water, meatball, pistachio, crushed almond, raisin; and soups – mastaba (yoghurt), kıjı (cress or mustard), and vermicelli. But the pilavs of partridge and pomegranate and various juicy and well-cooked kebabs were incredible.

Aside from these 200 silver platters, 200 of the Khan’s pretty pageboys with such names as Siyavuş, Kazım Sührab and Husrev Bakır, with their turbans at a rakish tilt, decked in gold and jewels and wearing waist-cloths with embroidered silver fringes, stood in rows before the Pasha like so many cypresses, respectfully offering china and porcelain dishes, crystal ewers carved in relief, and celadon bowls. The tongue falls short in praising the table-napkins, the jewel-handled spoons, the sherbet bowls, and the other utensils on display at this feast. In sum, the Khan and the Pasha sat kneeling at the spread, with the Khan’s sons Ziyaeddin, Bedreddin, Nureddehir and Şerefeddin on either side of the Pasha; they recited the besmele and then, the Pasha’s aghas on one side and the Khan’s on the other, laid into the 400 platters and bowls, each with the appetite of Ma‘di-karib or Mu‘awiya ibn Sakayat. This hungry tribe began to eat as though they were just released from Ma‘noghlu’s prison, or as though they were infected with canine hunger.

After dinner, hands were washed with musk-scented soap with ewers and bowls of bejewelled gold. Then a long gilt-thread napkin was laid down. The company was provided with spoons of phoenix, tortoiseshell, mother-of-pearl, walnut, emerald, garnet, agate, and yemeni, each worth a fortune. Fifty lovely pageboys, each robed in a splendid garment, held out fifty splendid bowls with fifty kinds of juices and sherbets, prepared with Hamah and Damascus sugar, indescribably delicious. These too were consumed by the Pasha and the Khan and all the aghas and note worthies. Ewers and bowls were again brought in for ablutions, this time made of porcelain set with gold and jewels. And spiced Yemenite coffee, salep, mahaleb, tea, fennel, hot rice-water, sweet sherbet, hot flour-water, and milk were served in jewelled cups.

Each day regularly after that, for breakfast we were regaled with hundreds of sweetbreads and jams and jellies and other confections – rhubarb, lemon, pear, wild carrot, nutmeg, cassia, and club-foot; for lunch, a sumptuous spread of the type described above; and another Muhammadan feast at supper time. For ten days and nights the noble Khan entertained Melek Ahmed Pasha in this manner, providing for all 3,060 men in his camp, from the aghas’ Segbans and Sarıcas down to the lowliest torchbearers and grooms. He did not let them want a hair cloth or a nosebag for their horses. Even their coffee was provided by the Khan.

After dinner the Khan addressed the Pasha thus, ‘My lord, we have in our service several master entertainers. If you wish, come to the lower pavilion overlooking the arena and you will observe the finest masters of sorcery and traversing of space and target-shooting and acrobatics that you have ever seen.’

‘Well,’ said the Pasha, ‘let us see.’ So they seated themselves in the pavilion overlooking the arena, and people gathered in rows on all four sides, awaiting the spectacle.

Marvels of magic and acrobatic skills. First, from Persia, a renowned acrobat named Pehlivan-zen-güzer came into the arena dressed in black deerskin. He kissed the ground before the Pasha; uttered benedictions upon the Prophet, the four companions, the twelve imams, the house of Osman, Melek Pasha, and the Khan and all his children; rubbed his face with his hand saying, ‘Give leave, O enlightened vizier!’ and recited the following verse:

Though all faults are in this slave,



Every fault the sultan favours is a virtue.





He kissed the ground once again, then began to strut and prance in the arena, faster than any noble steed, with the vigour of Amr Ayyar in his bearing, and the grace of Abu’l-Ma’ali in his speech. After that, he leapt before the Pasha crying Yallah, turned a somersault three times in the air and landed on his feet. Crying Ya Hayy he turned a quadruple somersault, spinning like a ball so that none of his limbs was visible; and as soon as he landed he made a short backward triple somersault – an amazing feat! He finished by holding head and hands and feet together and rolling in the arena like a top, with his limbs invisible.

Fourth number. Six men stood in the arena holding stretched open a sixteen-cubit-long muslin turban cloth. That swift acrobat raced like lightning and leapt across the sixteen-cubit-long band from one end to the other without stirring it the slightest. Truly a magical feat of running!

The next number: At two places in the arena he put three wine bottles one on top of the other. Leaping from the opposite side with the cry Yallah! he made a fearless somersault and landed squarely on top of them without losing balance or breaking the delicate bottles. Then he jumped to the ground and put three more bottles on each of the piles, making twelve in all. These were fragile glass decanters of Genoese manufacture, empty, and piled six atop one another the height of a man, such that the slightest breeze would make them sway.

‘A difficult feat,’ he said. ‘May God assist. Now hand to tambourine!’ With that, he went back forty or fifty paces. He pawed the ground and neighed like a horse. Crying ‘O Lord without equal!’ he leapt forward like a flash of lightning, or like an arrow released from a taut bow; and shouting Ya Hayy! when he reached the foot of the bottles, he sprang up like a fly and landed squarely with one foot atop each of the piles of six bottles. As Heaven is my witness, though he was stockily built, neither he nor the bottles budged in the slightest, nor was any broken. Standing on the bottles, he uttered benedictions on the Pasha, then jumped down, kissed the ground, and stood to one side.

A strange and wondrous spectacle, the science of magic. Molla Mehmed, the same who rode the emaciated horse during the grand entrance into Bitlis, now entered the arena in his dirty ragged turban and patched woolen cloak. After a perfunctory bow before the Pasha, he said pointedly, in his Kurdish dialect, ‘Why summon me to this arena of execution? You don’t invite me to the arena of feasting, because of my ragged clothes. And now you want me to show my skill.’ He went on in that vein, then cried: ‘Arise to prayer! May the Khan’s hearth burn forever, may Melek Ahmed Khan stand upright, may the spirits of Pythagoras and Avicenna and his brother Abu’l-Harith be joyful!’

He threw a sack into the arena. Pehlivan-zen-güzer’s assistants struck the drum and the tambourine. Molla Mehmed raised his hands and cried: ‘Brothers and dear ones, know and be aware! If you are firm-hearted men of God, then watch me with steadfast foot, otherwise put one foot forward and proceed to the exit.’ Suddenly he was naked as the day he was born, and prancing impudently about the arena. Approaching his sack, he cried: ‘My dear Khan, and my dear Melek Ahmed, perhaps it is impolite to walk before you naked like this. But you think I have private parts!? No, friends, I have no penis. Just take a look!’ – and then he turned about so that everyone in the audience could see. There was nothing – not penis nor testicles nor buttocks – only two flaps of skin in front and back like boards. He was neither male nor female, nor was he a eunuch. There was no sign of a posterior either. He had become a manikin.

After prancing about, he took a waist-cloth out of the sack and girded it round his waist. This was a cloth of marvellous weave, like the reed mat of Yemenite manufacture known as Aden cloth. Fixing this waist-cloth to his belt – a great spectacle – he began to hop up and down the arena like a large fluttering bird about to take off. And indeed, his feet lifted off the ground, and he began to fly in the air. As he soared about, he cried all the while to the spectators, ‘O wise ones! O foolish ones! O so-and-so son of so-and-so!’ – greeting by name people in the Pasha’s retinue whom he had never seen before.

The astonished audience was delighting at this spectacle, when Molla Mehmed, who was circling in the air at a height of four or five men’s statures and occasionally dropping down to touch the spectators’ heads with his feet, suddenly removed the waist-cloth, put it over his shoulder, and revealed a huge penis like that of Og son of Anaq.41 Holding this in his hand, while he sailed through the air, he started pissing, and sprayed the spectators who filled this palace arena. They all became soaking wet – only their armpits stayed dry. Some ran out the door; others exclaimed: ‘We just looked at the Molla naked and saw that he had no penis. Now, what is this enormous tool, and where did this damned rain of piss come from?’ But those Kurds who understood what was going on just drank up this ‘urine’ and pronounced it ‘water of life’.

Molla Mehmed hovered above the Khan and the Pasha, pissing and spraying. The Khan and his sons ran inside. The Pasha too, crying, ‘No power and no strength (except in God)!’ took refuge within the courtyard, as the Molla poured a shower of pee into the gilt-furnished pavilion where he had just been sitting. The Khan was laughing his head off. ‘Someone shoot that devil!’ he exclaimed. After a while, the Molla landed, put the waistcloth back on, and kissed the ground.

There was no more sign of a penis, nor of the rain of piss, nor of soaking-wet people. All the spectators were back in the arena with their clothes as dry as before. The Pasha put his finger to his mouth in astonishment, saying ‘Praise be to God!’ Now the Khan took the sable fur from his own back and presented it to Molla Mehmed. ‘O Molla,’ he said, ‘if you love me, perform another wonderful and perilous deed.’ ‘Just as you wish,’ replied the Molla.

Another marvel. ‘My Khan,’ said Molla Mehmed, ‘have all the doors of the arena shut, also the doors to the stairs going up, so that you and the viewers below will concentrate on the show.’ The Khan gave the signal, and all the doors were shut, so that it was like a castle wall on all four sides. Molla Mehmed took out some rags and tatters and bits of cotton from his sack and, with his servants, stuffed all the vents and holes in the doors.

Returning to the arena, he removed a cup from his sack, drank some water, and hid the cup back in the sack. Once again he took his penis in his hands and started to piss in the direction of the spectators. Even one who suffered incontinence of urine could not pee that much. As the Molla’s urine invaded the palace arena and began to form a lake there, as though the Great Zab and the Batman and the Charqa and Diyala Rivers were flowing into it, the thousands of frightened spectators raised a hue and cry. They kept up their moaning and wailing, but there was no place to escape. Then the Molla mounted his sack and began to float in this lake, while the people saw that they were about to drown. With one voice they cried: ‘Mercy, Melek Ahmed Pasha, mercy! Have them open the doors and let us escape this inundation.’

‘What’s going on here?’ said the Pasha. ‘Will you let so many people drown in your own house?’

The Khan kissed the Pasha’s hand. ‘My lord,’ he said, ‘it is a display of skill. There is no danger to life here. Be patient a while.’

When the crowd saw that no help was forthcoming from the Khan or the Pasha, those who could swim stripped naked, and several thousand men began to swim in this palace arena as though swimming in the sea. Others sought solace by embracing one another. Some scrambled together on the steps leading up, or began to climb the walls, or get on top of one another. Some uttered the witness-formula as they were drowning, or just gurgled in the water. In short, it was a scene from the Last Hour, there was so much shouting and commotion. As for me, I watched the entire spectacle from the Pasha’s pavilion. When Molla Mehmed had pissed out what he had originally drunk from the cup, the water on the ground only came up to a man’s heel; still, the onlookers below nearly drowned. Now the Molla took a crystal bowl out of his sack and struck it with a stone. It resounded like the bell of a clock. At once, not a single drop of water remained in the arena, nor any sign of a penis or a rump belonging to Molla Mehmed. Only several thousand men, stark naked, were clinging like bats to the palace windows, or scrambling up the walls. Looking at them, the Pasha and the Khan and the other notables laughed themselves silly. The poor fellows sunk into the ground from embarrassment, or went about in the crowd crying, ‘My clothes! My knife and dagger!’ If a man travelled for a thousand years he would not see such a sorry and funny spectacle.

Now Molla Mehmed again kissed the ground before the Pasha and the Khan.

‘For the Pasha’s sake,’ said the Khan, ‘show us another small part of your skill. We would not ask you to do something beyond your capacity.’ The Pasha tried to intervene, ‘Hey Khan! Get rid of this damned magician. He has frightened all my followers out of their wits.’

‘There is no danger here, my lord.’

Seeing that the Khan was enjoying the entertainment, the Pasha turned a blind eye and said, ‘Well, as long as he shows his skill in a reasonable manner.’

Another and final marvel. Molla Mehmed approached his sack and took out a multi-coloured embroidered waistband, which he concealed beneath his waist-cloth. After sitting upon it a moment, he removed the band from beneath the cloth, uttered a charm, and put it back in the sack. Suddenly the sack started to convulse and emit thunder and lightning. From its mouth emerged the head of a huge serpent, which slithered out and lay coiled up on the hot sand, facing the sun. But as it heaved, its body kept swelling, its eyes flamed like a torch, its teeth jutted like elephant tusks, and it became covered with hair like a deer. That dragon kept up like this for half an hour, until it was as large as an elephant. Then it writhed and stretched its long body in the heat, twisted and turned a while, and came up to Molla Mehmed. ‘I think I’ll ride this dragon,’ said the Molla; but the serpent struck him with its long tail, and he fell on his head and lay sprawling on the ground.

At this juncture the spectators began to get alarmed, saying, ‘If this dragon treats the Molla in this fashion, what will it do to us?’ And they tried to find a way out. Willy-nilly they broke down the garden gate of the palace and started to run away. Suddenly Molla Mehmed stood up from the ground, took a wand of red spiraea from his sack, struck the dragon, and mounted it. The dragon raised its head and tail into the air, let out a roar, spewed flames from its mouth, and stirred up a huge cloud of dust with its tail. Again it began to writhe and twist, and the crowd broke into a great hubbub, some fainting on the spot, others getting trampled underfoot. The poor chief bread-maker was so frightened he had an epileptic seizure.

‘Damn you, Molla Mehmed,’ cried the Pasha upon seeing this melancholy sight. ‘I won’t forget this!’ The Molla realised that the Pasha was upset. He made one turn with the dragon, came beneath the Pasha’s pavilion, and cried, ‘I commend you to God, my Pasha. Ya Hu! My blessings!’ With that, mounted on the dragon, he flew out the garden gate toward the mountains, and disappeared from view. Meanwhile the crowd gathered again in the arena, and everyone chattered in amazement.

The ocean of grace of the science of magic. Now Molla Mehmed’s sack was left in the arena. ‘Bring me that sack,’ said the Khan, ‘let’s take a look at Molla Mehmed’s meagre equipment.’

‘Hey Khan,’ cried the Pasha, ‘get rid of that devil’s things!’

‘For goodness’ sake, Pasha,’ said the Khan, let’s just take a look,’ and he opened the mouth of the bag.

There were multi-coloured threads of sheep’s and camel’s wool; hempen cords; various medicaments in boxes; thorns of gorse; camphor, gum benzoin, and myrrh; aloes and ambergris; pitch and tar; balsam and oleander; and all sorts of camphor candles; also old rags and pieces of striped Yazdi cloth, Kashani velvet, and Damascene kutni 42 not worth a penny; various ointments in small canisters; taffies and confections; seeds of melon, watermelon, cucumber, squash, and a thousand and one kinds of seeds of this sort; also tin bottles of ink, arac, vinegar, wine, naphtha, and sandarac; sheep and goat heads and trotters, salted and unshorn; a lion’s head; numerous dead snakes, skinks, lizards, scorpions and centipedes; the hooves and teeth of a donkey, a horse, a mule, a camel and a pig; several canisters with live leeches, centipedes, dung beetles, earthworms, and large ants; and boxes with live snakes, scorpions, snails, and bugs of various sorts from Lake Van; even a dried human head; also lion, tiger and leopard heads; and all sorts of animal skins, including sable, marten, ermine, and lynx. The entire contents were not worth a dime, but all existing things were in this magic ocean of a sack. The medicinal herbs and the aromatic woods in this bag could not be found in any apothecary’s or charcoal-seller’s shop.

‘My dear Khan,’ said the Pasha, ‘what did this devil do with all these worthless things? He has wine and raki and vinegar.’ ‘I swear by God, my lord,’ replied the Khan, ‘he has been with us for three years, and he has not once taken wine or tobacco or coffee.

‘He prays at night and fasts by day, and subsists on the fast of David. He has never eaten food of a slaughtered animal, and has never missed one of the five daily prayers. He learned this science of magic in the Maghreb, in the city of Marrakesh, and has demonstrated before my lord a small portion of his skill, at my behest. All the rest is merely a hypnotic trance, of no harm to anyone.’

‘What about these animal skins, and these live animals in boxes?’

‘A good question,’ said the Khan. ‘All the magical feats that he performs have their basis in the things of nature created by the hand of God, or the items which you see here. He expends his skill upon them as required. For example, he rubbed the oil from one canister on his body, uttered a charm, and appeared to be lacking a penis. He rubbed on oil of hoarfrost and dew, and appeared to fly in the air. He poured water over the people from a flask, and the crowd said, ‘He is pissing on us.’ He poured charmed water on the ground, and the people stripped off their clothes, thinking they were drowning. He took one of these snakes from the bag, uttered a charm, and it appeared in the shape of a dragon. Then, fearing my lord’s wrath, he flew off with the dragon, leaving his sack behind him as you see. Whatever animal skins he has in this sack, he can make appear to be alive – which of course only God could do actually – so he keeps one piece of each kind in his sack like his own head and soul.’

In this manner the Khan tried to justify his patronage of Molla Mehmed. But the Pasha said, ‘Take away that sorcerer’s sack.’

‘I did enjoy that flying acrobat,’ continued the Pasha. So Pehlivan-zen-güzer, whose name means ‘free and pure and beyond women,’ began to strike his drum and tambourine in the arena.

Another marvellous feat. The roofs of the houses on the eastern side of the Khan’s Garden palace, which was described above, are higher than the palace wall, and below them are bare cliffs, the height of two Süleymaniye minarets, such that a man dare not gaze down. A day or two previously, some hundred or so miners with their Farhadi picks had demolished the rocks in that perilous gorge, opening up a vast arena into which they poured sand. This was at the order of Pehlivan-zen-güzer, who knew that he would be displaying his skill, and who also had placed on top of the Khan’s palace a sack full of earth and horse-dung. Now Pehlivan said, ‘O my lord, Melek Pasha, brave vizier! If you wish to observe another feat performed by this lowly slave, please proceed to the balconies overlooking the cliffs, and you’ll see a marvel.’

The Pasha and the rest of the spectators moved to that side. While his assistants beat their drum and tambourine, Pehlivan, atop the roof, uttered a benediction, and cried, ‘O lovers! This is not a mere display of skill. It is a life-risking feat. I commend you to God. May you also commend me, and do not forget to pray for me. Whoever here is a Muhammadan, let him shower invocations on Muhammad’s roselike beauty. God bring it right!’

The thousands present echoed the cry: ‘God bring it right!’ With that, cruel Pehlivan took the sack of dung and earth mentioned above, held it tight under his buttocks, and hurled himself eagle-like from the palace roof, shouting Yallah! as he plunged the two-minaret distance. When he was just a man’s height above the ground, he did a somersault flip over the sack that was under his buttocks, and by God’s grace landed safely on his feet. He uttered another benediction. There was a horse ready there. In a wink he mounted, spurred the horse, and kissed the ground before the Pasha, who presented him with a purse of guruş. The Pasha then returned to the pavilion at the palace arena to watch the next spectacle.

Another marvellous acrobatic feat. Once again Pehlivan’s servants beat the drum and tambourine, while he performed turns and somersaults in the arena. He then took a hammer and two large nails out of his sack.

‘O my Khan,’ he said. ‘With your permission I will scale this lofty wall the height of eighty cubits.’

‘Permission granted,’ said the Khan. ‘May God make it easy for you.’

He approached the foot of the wall, uttered a benediction, then drove one of the nails in the wall as far up as his hands could reach, stuck his hammer in his belt, and with a flip and a cry of Yallah! mounted the nail and did some tricks. Then standing on this nail and clinging to the wall, he removed the hammer and the other nail from his belt, drove it between two rocks as high as possible, again stuck the hammer in his belt, and sprang spider-wise atop the second nail, where he again performed some tricks. The strange thing was that the nails were only a span and a half in length, and when they entered the wall three fingers thick, there was hardly room left, or any instrument left, with which to perform these feats.

Suddenly he slid upside-down like a snake and, holding the lower nail fast in his hands, caught hold of the upper nail claw-like with soles and toes curled around it, thus freeing his hands for some upside-down prestidigitations. Removing the hammer from his belt while suspended by his feet, he struck the lower nail until it came out, then slithered back to the upper nail, stood on it upright, and again drove in the first nail as far up as his hand could reach. He repeated this procedure several times, each time performing a hundred different gymnastics.

When the nails were up nine men high, he pulled out his tobacco pouch from his belt, placed it on the nail, and stood on his head waving his feet in the air. It was wonderful to see a human body go through such contortions atop a nail in the wall.

He continued to remove the lower nail while hanging from his feet and driving it in overhead, forty-seven times, without repeating any of the tricks he performed on one nail on another, until he rose forty-seven men’s heights to the top, where he uttered a benediction upon his masters and patron saints. He then drove both nails in together, threw down the hammer, and said: ‘O people of Muhammad! My tools were a hammer and two nails. Now the hammer is gone, and the nails cannot be removed. How shall I get down from this roof? My soul is in God’s hands: I will hurl myself down! God is my witness: I do not hold you responsible if I am killed. But do not forget to pray for me.’

He pulled out a pair of gloves from his bosom and put them on his hands saying Bismillah, Yallah! Then he hurled himself from the roof to the arena floor. The thoughtful spectators cried, ‘God preserve us, we are guilty of bloodshed!’ It turned out that the gloves he had put on were actually whipcords made of raw silk, with one end attached to the two nails that he had driven into the roof. Just as he was about to land on the ground, he took fast hold of the glove- cords in his hands, his body swung over to the wall, and he remained suspended by the cords. From there he flipped down to the ground and kissed the perfumed dust before the Pasha, who showered him with two handfuls of gold.





A most strange and phenomenal spectacle. While the Pasha and all the soldiery were watching these marvellous events, sitting next to the Pasha was a certain worthy and learned gentleman whose name I cannot recall – it was either Ismail or Molla Ali – a kinsman of the governor of Hakkari. This contentious individual, as though struck by a point of Kurdish honour, addressed the Pasha and the Khan thus, ‘This thief and knave of an acrobat and nail-climber goes right up to the roof of your harem. If he wished, could he not enter your harem one night and commit fornication? You don’t think of that. Instead, you put a sable robe on his shoulders and shower his head with perfumed gold. Now I’ll demonstrate the skills I learned from my ancestors. Let’s see what you’ll give me!’ With that he leapt down from the pavilion, tore off his sable fur, and started to strut around the arena crying, Ya Hayy, Ya Qayyum!

‘That Pehlivan scales walls using nails,’ he went on. ‘Let’s see how I’ll do it.’ At once he struck the face of the wall opposite once with his hand – and it stuck to the wall. Then he struck the other hand a bit higher – and it stuck too. In this manner, crying Ya Hayy, Ya Qayyum! all the while, he walked up, sticking to the face of the wall like a bat. With his kohik şanpur (?) turban on his head, and shoes with pointed tails on his feet, he circled several times round the face of the wall on all four sides of the palace arena – these walls are eighty or ninety cubits in height – shouting Ya Hayy, Ya Qayyum!, Ya Wahid, Ya Majid, Ya Ahad, Ya Fard, Ya Samad! (calling on various names of God). Finally he descended into the pavilion from the wall just above, settled himself back into place next to the Pasha, and demanded from him a large reward.

‘My Bey,’ said the Pasha, ‘you are of the House of Abbas. I know without having to ask. In fact you displayed a similar skill when you came to me in Diyarbekir from Hakkari in ’53 (1053/1643–4). God be praised that we meet once again in the town of Bitlis, here in the palace of our brother the Khan.’

‘Yes,’ answered the Bey, ‘and since we have not seen each other for so long, neither have I seen your favour.’ So the Pasha gave him a purse, and the Khan gave him a purse of guruş, and they each gave him a robe of honour and an Arab horse with all the trimmings, and sent him on his way to Hakkari with letters for Khan Yezdenşir.

In sum, if I were to record all the strange and wondrous things that were our daily fare in Bitlis during our ten-day halt, it would be a scroll of delights.

On his arrival there the horse drops dead, and Geda bewails its death in a poem wherein he incidentally laments his own unrequited affection.’ (Dankoff 1990, quoting Köhler).

3. The ruined city of Ahlat





According to the Persian chroniclers this is one of the cities of Armenia in the eighteenth of the conventional climes. The ruined city contains hundreds of domed buildings and splendid ancient mosques that seem to have just been released from the hands of their architects. All the cupolas are constructed of stone; some, pertaining to once-flourishing mosques, are covered with limewash. But they are now deprived of congregations and have become the nests of pigeons and crows and owls.

There is one flourishing mosque that has remained, however: that of Emir Kay. Its walls all around are intact, completely up to the roof, and smooth as Chinese paper. The owner of this mosque, Emir Kay, was an author of the ancient city, and for this reason the walls all around are covered with an inscription that shows how flourishing the ancient city was. It lists all the great buildings – Friday mosques, neighbourhood mosques, medreses, hans, baths, and royal markets. It is written very clearly, as though engraved on a seal, in Musta‘sımi script. This humble one read it and recorded as much as I could, though but a drop in the ocean and a speck in the sun. I was so assiduous in reading it that I had to use my spyglass in order to make out the part next to the roof. The language that was used in Old Ahlat is an unusual dialect of Turkish close to Chagatay and Mongolian and contains many interesting expressions, such as, İşven, gitmişven I have departed; gurumıza varmışmız We have gone to our graves; bizim Kay gibidir, boğaz eyitdi; dükeli geleserlerdir All of them will come; meni suncamışdır, şad bay kişidir, ayıtdım şol kişi menfadınadır; savular sayladım – i.e., I was left weeping; barıımız uruş kişisimiz – i.e., we are all men of war.

The inscription records that when this city was thriving it had 35,000 prayer-niches, 2,000 medreses, 1,000 baths, 2,000 hans, 1,000 Hadith schools, 6,000 primary schools, 800 dervish convents, 18,000 fountains, 8,000 water dispensaries, 10,000 Muslim quarters – there was no mention of infidels or Christians, 200,000 Muslim houses, 70,000 palaces of the notables, 3,000 caravanserais, 2,000 bachelor quarters, 600,000 shops, 150 covered markets with lofty cupolas – some of these are still intact albeit swarming with snakes and vermin, and 700 soup kitchens.

This city stretched a three-day’s walk along the shore of Lake Van when it was thriving. It had 40,000 excursions, 900,000 orchards and gardens, 70,000 lofty shrines, 600,000 ulema notables, 400,000 physicians, 100,000 surgeons, 150,000 sheikhs, thousands of saints suspected of miraculous graces, also 40,000 muftis belonging to the four legal schools, 70,000 descendants of the Prophet, 600,000 armed soldiers, 40,000 watchmen, 2,000 Sharia courts, 700 administrative officers, and 3,000 public scales officials.

On the slopes of the summer pastures are 3,000 caves, still visible, in many of which lived travellers on the spiritual path, withdrawn from society, who subsisted on bran for seventy or eighty years.

The summer pasture of this city is Mt Subhan, which ranks just after the summer pasture of Bingöl. It had 3,000 milk cisterns. They milked their sheep and goats, water buffalo, cows and horses, and there were separate cisterns for storing the milk of each kind of animal. There were also 7,000 milk fountains down in the town. The owners of the milk would send men with word to the city where people would draw the milk down to the fountains and pay a tithe to the emperor of Mahan. This imperial tithe was absolute and the people never objected to it; it is for this reason that the chroniclers call Ahlat the Land of Bumpkins.

There were so many saints here that whatever they prayed for was granted.

Even now the conduits are visible that brought milk from the summer pasture to the fountains. In fact, there is a marketplace consisting of 3,000 shops near the Ali Kay mosque with stone placards above each section saying ‘Bazaar of the Saddlers’, ‘Bazaar of the Weavers’, ‘Bazaar of the Silk-makers’. There are even placards saying ‘Sheep’s-milk Fountain’, ‘Goat’s-milk Fountain’, ‘Mare’s-milk Fountain’ – the word for mare in this case being baytal. Hence one may conclude that the populace were Tatars, since they drank mare’s-milk, and since the inscriptions are all written in the Tatar Chagatay dialect.

When this city was thriving, no animal other than horses could enter it. Animals were slaughtered outside the city limits and brought to the 7,000 butcher shops in town. And cattle of all sorts were milked in the summer pasture; the milk was then brought down in conduits and sold at the milk fountains. The pastures and mountains and orchards are on the northern side of the ruined city, whereas on the southern side is Lake Van.

One of the mosques has its endowment charter written on the mosque’s wall. It states that the endowment consists of 1,500 shops, 1,000 fields, 100 mills, and 500,000 gold pieces. At the end it says: ‘If anyone destroys these endowments, may the curse of Haman and Korah and Marwan and Pharaoh and Yazid be upon his descendants and himself.’ And underneath is the Koranic verse: None should visit the mosques of God except (those who believe in God and the Last Day …) (9:18)





4. On ‘extinguishing the candle’





Shrine of Salih Efendi. He was the chief deputy of Sheikh Safi, the forefather of all the Persian shahs who are buried in the pure ground of Ardabil and belonged to the Vahidi Sufi order. Following the miracles that occurred when Sheikh Safi extinguished the candle, this Salih Efendi prohibited the practice – may his grave be sanctified.

Notice concerning ‘extinguishing the candle’. Sheikh Safi achieved the rank of Pole of Poles in the city of Ardabil in the year (—). One day, due to divine inspiration, he went into an ecstasy and summoned the thousandfold congregation to the Muhammadan tevhid. He also summoned their womenfolk to attend. So all the women came, with their veils and head-covers, and thousands of them were in a corner occupied with tevhid. After night fell, Sheikh Safi produced a lighted candle and said, ‘Come, my daughters, you too enter the tevhid, just like my sons.’

Just as all the men and women together were performing tevhid and tezkir, the saintly Sheikh Safi extinguished the candle and all the men and women mingled together and performed the royal tevhid for seven full hours. Finally Sheikh Safi uttered the words, ‘and blessings upon all the prophets and the apostles.’ He passed his hands over his face, then commanded, ‘Let everyone, dark as it is, embrace the ones next to him and go home.’

It turned out that all the men, by virtue of the saintly grace of Sheikh Safi, in that massive confusion had embraced their own wives and daughters and went home. It is truly a miracle that in that dark of night and in that mingling and whirling crowd of people, everyone should have found his very own wife.

During Sheikh Safi’s lifetime the candle was extinguished several times, and each time all the men found their own wives and daughters. But after his death, when certain of his deputies extinguished the candle, they missed finding their own womenfolk and the Persians began to be villified as ‘candle extinguishers’. So this saintly Sheikh Salih, buried in Urmia, prohibited men and women from performing tevhid together and prohibited extinguishing the candle.

People say that in Persia there are still those who do it. But as God is my witness, I travelled to Persia from Erzurum in the year 1056 (1646); in 1055 (1645) I went from Baghdad to Hamadan and Darguzin; later, in 1077 (1666–7) I went from the Crimea to Daghestan and from there through the Iron Gate of Persia (i.e. Darband) to Shamaki in Shirvan and Baku in Gilan; and in the present instance (1065/1655) I visited, aside from Urmia, also Khoy, Marand, Tasuj, Qumla and Tabriz; and I never saw anything resembling ‘extinguishing the candle.’ But the people of this world are slanderers and libelers and cavilers.

It is also reported about the province of Sivas, in the sancaks of Keskin and Bozok, and in Sunkur and Imad, that they extinguish the candle and that everyone embraces another man’s wife and lies with her in a corner – God forbid! This humble slave has traversed those regions often since the conquest of Baghdad (in 1648); and during our lord’s governorship of Sivas (i.e. Murtaza Pasha, in 1650) I carried out several offices in Keskin and in Bozok; and I never observed anything like that.

Again, these officious people claim that there are Shah-lovers and candle-extinguishers and men and women who wear the Shah’s diadem in Rumelia, in the province of Silistria, in the districts of Deli Orman and Kara Su, and in the Dobrudja. As God is my witness, I have sojourned in those countries perhaps fifty times, and have carried out offices there, and I never observed any such illegitimate activities – although, to be sure, there are those who fail to pray, or who run after singing girls.

There is however, in Damascus a quarter called Sazenekler whose populace do pay allegiance to Persia. And also there are people belonging to the Nukhudi sect throughout the Druze and Teymani mountains of Syria, who are seventy times worse than the Kızılbaş. I have recorded them in detail in Volume (—) (3) in the account of my travels in Damascus and Syrian Tripoli.43

43 The reference is to the discussion of the sects in Jabal Naqura in Vol. 3, fol. 40a–b.





VOLUME FIVE





East Anatolia and the Balkans





IN MAY 1656, Evliya returns to Van. On a lightning trip to Istanbul, where Melek Pasha sends him as courier, he has an encounter with highwaymen in a treacherous mountain pass near Bolu (cf. Volume 9, selection 2). Then he is sent to Bitlis to collect arrears, and has to flee when the angered Abdal Khan returns from exile at the news of Melek Pasha’s removal from office. The highly dramatised account of his escape reads like an adventure novel.

In May 1657, Evliya accompanies Melek Pasha on the Polish campaign and later that year assists in repelling a Cossack siege of Azov. In March 1659, he enters the service of vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha and joins the campaign against Celali rebels in western Anatolia; then the Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania campaigns, before reuniting with Melek Pasha in Sarajevo in the summer of 1660.

Melek Pasha sends Evliya on a mission to Split, giving him the opportunity to observe the Venetians (cf. Volume 6, selection 5) and practice his Italian. In January 1661, he joins Melek Pasha at his new posting in Sofia. Sent into the countryside to collect arrears, Evliya has another confrontation with a bandit.





1. Highwaymen in the Bolu Pass; return to Van





Account of our journey from Istanbul to Van


Departing from Üsküdar with a besmele – stage of Gegbizye (Gebze) – stage of Iznimgit (Izmit) – stage of the city of Bolu – stage of the town of Çerkeş.

Setting out at sunset we ran into seven highwaymen. After some words they bared their swords and told us to strip. My three servants and I dismounted and we showed them the orders and letters in our saddlebags.

‘What should we do with these?’ cried one of them. ‘Do you have gold and jewels?’

‘No, I swear by God, only these, and in this saddlebag our shirts and underwear.’

‘God bless you, we are mountain men, we have need of shirts,’ he said, and took the bag with the shirts.

I leapt to one side, thinking that I would be able to grab my sword, but all seven rushed upon me with their muskets in hand.

‘Gazis!’ I cried. ‘Attacking a courier who has ridden until he and his horse are both exhausted is like striking a pregnant woman. Don’t you know that there are no strangers among people of faith? What you are doing, even Köroğlu did not do in these mountains. If you are men of God, let us go free.’

I kept talking and pleading in this fashion, until one of them untied his sword from his waist and said: ‘Young man, this is a very fine sword. Keep it in memory of me. And you give me the silver-decked sword at your waist: I too will wear it as a keepsake from you.’

‘Of course,’ said I, and gave him my sword in return. Then we all kissed and became brothers. God be praised, they did not touch anything else.

Stage of Tosya. That night we passed Osmancık and the towns of Gümüş and Kerkez. Stage of Amasya – pass of Çengalli, very dangerous, which we crossed at night – stage of the castle of Niksar – stage of Koyluhisar – headlong down the crevice, stage of the village of Keremli. We passed the city of Erzincan, took fresh horses and went via the Erzurum plain. Stage of the walled city of Erzurum – eastward, stage of Malazcird – stage of Erciş. There we took fresh horses, passed Amik castle.





Stage of the castle of Van, frontier of Azerbaijan


At the break of dawn they opened the postern gate. God be praised, on the thirteenth day (after leaving Istanbul) I saw the blessed face of our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha. He read the orders and noble rescript and the letters, expressed his delight that Siyavuş Pasha was now the grand vizier, and bestowed on this humble one a purse of guruş and one set of clothing with a sable’s head fur-piece.

‘Evliya,’ he said, ‘my condolences, your slaveboy named Kazım has died. Here are two Georgian slaveboys in compensation.’ Very pleased, I went to my dwelling and rested for a week.

One day the Pasha said: ‘My Evliya, you brought me good news in your capacity as courier. Now I have another task for you: to bring the letters of investment to my son the Khan of Bitlis and to the emir of Ziriki. Leave in the morning, without delay, for the time is already late. Join forces with the canteen officer in Bitlis, get the remaining seventy purses from my son the Khan, and bring them here as soon as possible. For you know what is written in the noble command and friendly letter that you have conveyed.’





2. Escape from Bitlis





We were again greeted by the Khan and outfitted with a sumptuous room. Night and day we caroused with the Khan and his twelve brothers – God be praised, the nights were like the Night of Power and the days were like the Day of the Festival of Sacrifice. Following the Pasha’s instructions, I joined forces with the canteen officer and with great effort we managed to collect fifty purses from the noble Khan, which we sent off to Van with 300 musketeers along with our own goods, so we were left in Bitlis free of care. Now the new Khan owed only twenty purses, and the canteen officer kept pressing him for them. This humble one, meanwhile, got along splendidly with all the princes and the tribal emirs and the Bitlis grandees, receiving gifts and favours from each one, so that in a short time I amassed four wardrobes of clothing and other rare and precious items, plus seven purebred horses. Each day we celebrated as though it were the Khwarazm-shah’s New Year.

By God’s will, in the year (—) (1066), on the first day of Jumadi al-awwal (26 February 1656) we got news that our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha had been removed from office, and that the governorship of Van had been given to Pehleli Ahmed Pasha. But, since it was the dead of winter, the Pasha remained in Van, as the new governor’s agent took charge. Along with this news came a letter from our Yusuf Kethüda regarding the collection of the remaining twenty purses. ‘Do not come back without them,’ he wrote.

The following day, what should we see but Abdal Khan, who had fled during the battle with our lord Melek Ahmed Pasha on Monday 24 Ramadan 1065 (28 July 1655), entering the town of Bitlis. There was great commotion among the populace. Everyone thought, ‘Now that Melek Ahmed Pasha’s removal from office has been confirmed, Abdal Khan, having fled to the mountains of Mudiki, has returned to Bitlis. What will he inflict on our town now!’ Out of fright, they all rushed with their gifts to greet the old Khan.

I too went to see Abdal Khan, bringing as gift a finely calligraphed Koran. He rose to greet me, took me by his side, and showered me with favours and flatteries.

‘My little Evliya, so you are here?’ he said.

‘Yes, my Khan. For twenty years now I have been eating the bread and licking the bowls of your noble house. For the sake of the pure soul of your noble ancestor Sultan Evhadehullah, set me up in this town as your protegé, and accept me in your service. I will no longer go to Melek Pasha’s gate.’ He removed the cover from a small cabinet by his side.

‘Here is the deed to a dye works which will provide you a daily income of four guruş. I will also give you an estate in Muş. And I’ll give you some slavegirls, and set you up as a married man.’ Aside from this he gave me a Shahnama (of Firdawsi), a Gulistan (of Sa‘di), a hundred Spanish guruş, and a suit of clothes.

What should we see next but his son Ziyaeddin, whom Melek Ahmed Pasha had set up as his protegé, coming and falling at his father’s feet. He laid before him the imperial warrant of khanship and the noble orders that Melek Pasha had brought from the capital, also the letter of investment and the robe of honour that I had just conveyed from the Pasha. Rubbing his face in the dust at his father’s foot, he said, ‘My father, my lord and Padishah: I swear by God that during the war with Melek Pasha they demanded me as khan, in consultation with all the people of the country, in order to prevent anyone from the outside interfering in our rule. I have served for a year as your deputy. Now that Melek Pasha too is removed from office, may God bless you once again with crown and fortune!’

‘Now my son,’ replied the Khan in a prudent fashion, ‘I have entered my eightieth year. Many a time have I strung my bow and shot my arrow, and hung my bow in the firmament. I have won fame and fortune from heaven, and have borne the hot and the cold of this celestial sphere. God forbid that I should henceforth accept the khanship. Here are you, my twelve beloved sons and lights of my eyes. Join your hearts, and rule Bitlis with wisdom and singleness of purpose, so that you not be a laughingstock to the people. Just provide for my needs, and let me withdraw with your mother and my household to a quiet corner, where I will pray for your welfare. Take away these warrants, may God bless you!’ But all the time he spoke he was choked with rancour and his words were full of contempt.

In short, there was a great deal of discussion. After we had dined and washed our hands, the Khan said, ‘My Evliya is one of us, not just now but previously as well. Prepare a chamber for him near mine so that we may converse together.’ I again kissed the Khan’s hand, then returned to my room and lay down for a nap.

In a dream I saw my late father. ‘Son,’ he said, ‘you will manage to leave this town and flee via Ahlat castle. Don’t worry, just continue to recite the Koran.’ I woke up, renewed my ablution, and at once began a complete recitation of the Koran, which I completed two days later.





Adventure of Evliya the sincere, in the city of Bitlis. One morning this humble sinner emerged from my chamber at the Khan’s Garden, withdrew to a quiet corner in the treasury room of the divan hall, and, while everyone else was still asleep, occupied myself peacefully reciting my litanies. Suddenly from the harem the old Khan (sent me) a silver tray with ten porcelain plates containing pears, lemons, myrobalans, olives, sour cheese, filtered honey, all kinds of conserves, fine white folded bread like rose pinks, also a jug of ambergris-flavoured soup and a jug of rice-water sherbet. As I sat in a corner eating alone, a certain Tavaşi Amber Agha emerged from the harem door, a eunuch with scowling face but Jesus-like disposition. He handed me a bag of clothing.

‘My lady Hanım Sultan greets you,’ he began, ‘and says that you should put on these clothes and leave immediately. Go to your Pasha, and when you are again in the company of Kaya Sultan, do not forget my lady in your prayers. But you must leave immediately.’ Thus did I ‘get news from Loqman’ from this Loqman-like eunuch. I was non-plussed, and began to think all sorts of dark thoughts, when the negro said, ‘Guard the bag and the clothes carefully, and don’t tell a soul.’ Then he slipped away.





I was quite bewildered, wondering what the purport of this unexpected visit might be. As I resumed eating my breakfast, the harem door again opened, and the two elder sons of Abdal Khan appeared, the eldest Bedir Bey and the next eldest Nureddehir Bey. They were still in their bedclothes and had nightcaps on their heads.

‘Good morning, Evliya Çelebi, how are you faring? I see you are again eating from father’s silver tray. The Khan our father has honoured you with a breakfast. If you don’t mind some partners, we can eat together.’ They sat down next to me, and I recited the verse:

All is yours, my heart and soul;



Just take the trouble to advance one foot.



All that I own is a thank offering



I place in your path – don’t you know?





As a joke I added: ‘This food is mine, but you may eat it as though it belonged to your father the Khan. It is yours to have and enjoy, it is your Seyf Kuli Agha pilav (?).’

As we were eating, Nureddehir spoke up, ‘God be praised, one silver tray and these porcelain plates were left unplundered in our father’s war with Melek Ahmed Pasha.’ He smiled as he spoke, and I knew he was testing me, but I did not answer a word, just kept on chewing and munching. Now it was Bedir Bey’s turn.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ he said, ‘so now your Pasha too has been removed from office. What did he hope to gain by putting this town to the sword like that, ruining our province and our city, massacring so many thousands of men, and committing such outrages on that blessed Ramadan day that ten Egyptian treasures were plundered from our town. Do you think Melek Pasha and his followers and the Van garrison brigands will get away with this? Do you think they will be able to keep all that plundered wealth?’

‘To tell you the truth, my princes,’ said I, ‘there are many kinds of dervishes in this world. I am the kind who goes out among people, rides horses, and keeps servants. Still, I am unconcerned with the affairs of the world. A war happened, a province was plundered and ruined. I know nothing of that. I only know that I am your well-wisher, and that for twenty years now I have been a wandering dervish longing for your house, to which I have finally come. God be praised, this very day your father the noble Khan has given me the deed to a dye works, and has set me up as his protegé. Now treat me in whatever manner suits your noble dignity. I am a wayfarer at this threshold, arrived here out of my love, and have the impertinence to seek your favour.’

I said all kinds of humiliating things, as I continued to eat my breakfast, but it was like swallowing poison. Then Bedir Bey, God bless him, said, ‘It’s true. Evliya Çelebi is a wandering dervish and a world traveller. He cries the chant of every cart he mounts and sings the praises of every man who feeds him. Wherever he rests his head, he eats and drinks and is merry.’

While we were still talking and the breakfast dishes were still before us, the door of the divan hall opened, it being dawn, and in walked Halhali Haydar Kethüda, whom Melek Ahmed Pasha had made Ziyaeddin Khan’s steward. He was a decrepit grey-beard, 110-years old, and had an earring swaying from his ear. As he entered he greeted us warmly, ‘Greetings to you, my princes, and good morning to you, my Evliya.’ The princes did not return the greeting, but I said, ‘And good morning to you, O knight Haydar, seeing far, and heart-weary as you are.’

‘I am rather far-sighted,’ he said. ‘But why did my princes not return this old man’s greetings and salutations?’ And he began bustling about the audience hall.





Upshot of the adventure. As poor Haydar Kethüda was bustling about the audience hall, he came up to the biheri or fireplace which was next to the princes, cleared his throat with an ‘Ah-tu’ and spat out a wad the size of a mullet-oyster, which spattered over the princes and myself. He made some disdainful remarks and kept mumbling, ‘The princes didn’t return my greeting,’ then went ‘Ah-tu’ and spat again, raining saliva over the stone tiles and over Bedir Bey.

At this Bedir and Nureddehir leapt to their feet, crying ‘Kill that old fart!’ At once the door of the closet next to me opened, and out came Güzel Dereli Musli Agha with drawn sword. He leapt right over my head and brought his sword down upon Haydar Kethüda. Poor Haydar, wounded, drew a dagger from his belt and began to struggle with Musli Agha. As they were wrestling like Mahmud Piryar Veli’s dancing-boys, Abdurrahman Bölükbaşı and Kanah-dereli Deli Mahmud also dashed out of the closet and came up with their swords flashing. Old Haydar Khan, fearing for his life, kept hitting at them with his dagger, as they kept striking him. The poor old man ran about the divan hall shouting for help. Finally he rushed upon the princes, brandishing his dagger. The pages surrounded him, and as they were cutting him up with dagger and sword, Nureddehir said, ‘He is your Pasha’s protegé, Evliya. If you love the Khan, why don’t you strike him with your dagger?’ I darted from my place, and tore off the turban from his head, the ring from his ear, the Haydari palheng-stone from his waist, and his dagger sheath and knife. But his sable fur was already cut to pieces.

It seems the poor fellow still had some life in him. He latched onto my foot, heaved a sigh, stood up, then fell again. While the pages were slicing at him, all of a sudden his own servants, who had been standing outside the door holding his slippers and boots, rushed in with drawn swords and began some swordplay with the pages, so that several people aside from Haydar Kethüda lost their lives, and the carpets turned into a lake of blood. God knows, those Kurdish braves who rushed in from outside hacked away with their swords like Kassab Cömerd with his butcher knife. But what could five or six men accomplish against seventy or eighty warlike pages? The princes and I huddled in a corner and were bathed with blood. Finally, citing the adage, ‘the minority must bow to the majority,’ I started to help the princes take the corpses by the legs and drag them away. As we were lugging the guts, huffing and puffing, a watch fell out of Haydar Agha’s pocket. I picked it up, and also removed his rings just outside the door. We dragged the corpses away and threw all four down over the balustrade and into the palace arena.

By now I was nearly out of my mind. During breakfast Nureddehir had said, ‘Do you think Melek Ahmed Pasha and his followers will get away with this?’ And before that, Hanım Sultan had sent me a bag of clothes from the harem and said, ‘You should go to your Pasha immediately.’ When this latest event also took place, I kept reciting the Witness formula (expecting imminent death); otherwise I was speechless.

After this my heart was on fire. I could not sleep at night. I was constantly making plans to escape, though I revealed this to no one. Beginning that very day, though it was the dead of winter, I mounted with my slaveboys and we exercised the horses, forcing paths through the snow. But whenever I was in the company of the Khan and the princes, I would recount our heroic deeds, saying, ‘We struck Haydar Agha thus, he struck us thus,’ and they would say, ‘Wasn’t it that Haydar who brought Melek Ahmed Pasha to this town with eighty thousand soldiers? He got what he deserved!’

The next day, however, 10,000 select musketeers, all troops from Haydar Agha’s clan, had mustered within Bitlis town and on the hills overlooking the Khan’s Garden, demanding blood for blood, and clamouring that the case be settled according to the Sharia. The ulema and the sheikhs intervened, saying, ‘This Haydar Kethüda is the one who brought Melek Ahmed Pasha to this town; that is why he was made steward. He got what he deserved.’ In this way peace was restored between the clansmen and the Khan. So poor Haydar Kethüda, and three of his servants, and five of the Khan’s retinue all shed their blood for nought. The clansmen consoled themselves with the thought that at least their chief, the knight Haydar, did not die alone. And so they returned home.

Until now Abdal Khan had not emerged from his harem. That very day, after the suit of Haydar Kethüda’s clan had been disposed of, he came out to the divan hall and sat down in a corner, intending to be unobtrusive and merely listen. He did occasionally say a few words relating to affairs of state, and some wits observed that ‘the Khan has some mischief up his sleeve.’ Later the Khan said, ‘My Evliya, what do you think about this matter of Haydar Kethüda?’

‘Ants take wing when they are about to perish,’ I replied. ‘He was contemptuous of everyone, and not subtly, but in view of all the courtiers. In fact, on the auspicious day he was killed, he came over to where I was sitting with my princes and, as though spitting into the fireplace, he let out such a gob of slime that my princes’ suits were spoiled and my own face was covered with a rainstorm of spit.’ Along with such disparaging remarks I also cracked some jokes, which made the Khan laugh and cheered him up quite a bit. While he was still in this merry mood, I kissed the Khan’s noble hand and said, ‘My lord and patron, most noble Khan! It is now forty-one years that I have been a world traveller and boon-companion to mankind. I am tired of roaming the seven climes.

Know you, my soul, what in this world



Ought not to cease?



I’ve been everywhere, and there is nought



Better than – Bitlis!





The climate is mild – especially that my Khan is the reigning spirit in this country. True, you have given me a dye works, and have thus raised me from the dust. But give me a house and a slavegirl too!’ I sealed this request with a kiss on the knee, and he turned to Çakir Agha, who served as his vizier.

‘Çakir,’ he said, ‘go bring my jewel-encrusted casket that I keep with me in the harem.’ When he brought it, the Khan said, ‘You see, my Evliya, your pasha came with 8,000 soldiers and ruined this house of ours. They pillaged ten Egyptian treasures’ worth of my wealth, reducing me to penury. Of all my properties and goods, only this little case escaped unharmed, since it was whisked away by my wife Hanıma Sultan, Zal Pasha’s daughter. I also managed to convey seven mule-trains of goods and treasures to the Mudiki mountains before your pasha could get to them – they are there still in the Mudiki country. Now, just take a look inside this casket.’

He removed the cover and I peered in. Glory to God! It was filled with rubies, emeralds, pearls, chrysolites, garnets, turquoises, cats-eyes, fish-eyes, and tomcats-eyes. The middle compartment alone was overflowing with brilliant diamonds, each one 20 or 30, even 40 carats. The outside of the casket was Frankish enamel work, painted in gold as though by Mani, and studded with pure gems. Indeed, the rulers of the world could not afford to purchase such a thing, they could only seize it by force. Even I, who have seen something of the world, was dazzled at the sight of this case, and bit my finger in astonishment.

‘What is it, my Evliya?’ said the Khan when he saw me in this state.

‘By God, my Khan, I have roamed the world for forty-one years and visited eleven kingdoms; I have been boon-companion to nine padishahs and have sat with them knee to knee; but I have never seen anything like this highly-wrought jewel-encrusted casket.’ The Khan was immensely pleased.

‘Now my Evliya,’ he said, ‘since you love us, and since you have left Melek and wish to remain here, henceforth you are my son, and I appoint you as tutor to my sons. From now on you may rest easy. Forget about the anarchy and rebellions of Kurdistan. You stay with me and enjoy your leisure in whatever orchard or garden you wish. I swear by the spirit of my ancestors of the House of Abbas, and by the soul of Sultan Evhadehullah, and I swear by God: I will drown you in wealth, to spite Melek Pasha; I’ll give you one of my daughters in legitimate marriage; and I’ll give you several slavegirls and a fine pleasure-garden. Now, accept these deeds. They are for a garden plot in the Avih valley, including a multitude of courtyards laid out like Persian avenues, a variety of chambers, and a bath with pool and fountain.’ He took the title deeds out of the jewellery case and handed them to me, and I rubbed my face upon his felicitous foot.

When I came out, I displayed these gifts to all the courtiers and pretended to be deliriously happy at this good fortune. But the truth was that all joy had vanished from my heart ever since Haydar Agha was cut up at my side. I could only think about mounting my horse, girding my sword, and running away. My joy had turned to sorrow, my wine to poison; as in the verse:

Not everyone knows what pain I suffer;



Only I know, and the only God knows.





I remained in Bitlis two more months in this state, unable to go anywhere, since we were completely snowbound.

One day, letters arrived from Melek Ahmed Pasha for Ziyaeddin Khan and for myself, instructing me and the canteen officer to collect without fail the twenty purses still outstanding. Old Abdal Khan got wind of this, and said, ‘He stole ten Egyptian treasures of wealth from this town, and claims that twenty purses are left. God willing, now that he is removed from office in Van, and he cannot return via Erzurum in this dead of winter, he will decide to take the milder route via Diyarbekir, so he will have to pass through the valley of Bitlis. God willing, I will turn old Melek into a monkey bombarded by cannon shot all the way to Donkey Valley. I’ll make him bray like a donkey and make his followers groan, I’ll strip him naked and cook him raw, I’ll pour a chamber-pot over Melek’s head as I did to Boynueğri Mehmed Pasha, I’ll smear his cheeks and his eyes with filth, and taking a few of my favourite pages I’ll capture all his drums and standards!’

He took a solemn oath to this effect, and all present in the council applauded, crying: ‘What you say is quite just, my Khan.’

Then he addressed me: ‘What do you think, my Evliya?’

‘My Khan,’ I replied, ‘still, you are a noble padishah, with heart as bounteous as the sea. Still, you will act with forgiveness. You will ignore what the Pasha has done, and if he comes here out of office, you will receive him just as when he came before. You will repay kindness for the evil he has done, saying, ‘He is an imperial son-in-law and a noble vizier, I will do what befits my dignity and preserves my reputation.’ Then all the people of Kurdistan, and all the people in the lands of the House of Osman, will applaud and sing your praises, while they curse Melek with a million curses reserved for the likes of Haman and Pharaoh and Korah and Yazid. Melek will suffer malediction, while you, my Khan will enjoy benediction. You know the saying:

Cast goodness upon the waters:



God knows, what matters if the fish do not?’





‘Bravo, Evliya,’ said the Khan, ‘you are truly a man of chivalry, who knows the due of bread and salt. I was fired up with righteous indignation, and said that I would do this and that. But if Melek does come to this humble valley, I’ll embarrass him with gifts and favours, I’ll give him enough stores to last until he reaches Diyarbekir, I’ll give him my own sons as an entourage, including my son Ziyaeddin whom he made khan, and they’ll accompany him as far as Diyarbekir by my order.’

He spoke many such vaunting words. But every day in Bitlis town some innocents would be the objects of slanderous accusations: ‘You are the ones who instigated Melek Ahmed Pasha and brought him to this region;’ or, ‘You are Haydar Kethüda’s puppet.’ And every day they would toss innocent Muslims from the tower of Bitlis castle, or else they would gang up on them and hack them down with swords, or they would throw them with hands tied to their necks off the Garden cliffs, or from Mt Deh-divan, or the Avih cliffs, and the poor victims would lunge down like the birds of Ababil (105:3) and be dashed in a hundred pieces on the rocks below. Only God succoured one man: as soon as they tossed him down from the castle, the fellow’s shirt opened like a sail and caught on a rock, where he was left hanging. By my request they attached lassoes to the fellow, drew him up, and let him go free.





Noteworthy adventures. There was a certain Molla Mehmed the Sorcerer, a veritable Avicenna in the science of magic. He was described above, when Melek Ahmed Pasha first arrived in Bitlis and this Molla mounted a bath log and rode it as a King and Beggar horse.

One day the Molla and I were in the Avih valley in the town of Bitlis, watching the young lads of the town skiing over the snow and the ice on their tahuk or skis. All the lovely Rozhiki boys were hugging and romping, skiing down to the bottom of the valley, then climbing back up the slope to show off their skill again. And quite a few of us old lechers were having fun watching their antics.

‘Tell me, Evliya Çelebi,’ said my companion Molla Mehmed, ‘which of those boys would you like to see ski down the hill, and then keep on skiing up this side so we can get a closer look?’

I pointed out two lads wearing pied headbands and holding their skis in their hands. ‘Those are the ones I would like to see.’

‘And I,’ said the Molla, ‘have fallen in love with those two boys over there, with pied bands on their heads, Küfre jackets on their backs, and their skis underneath them. Now I’m going to make all four of those lovely lads ski uphill on this side and come right toward us.’ He turned to face the other way, covered his head with the skirts of his coat, and recited some mumbo-jumbo. All at once the four pretty boys whom we had pointed out skied like lightning down to the bottom of the valley, then kept right on skiing up the hill on our side, shooting up like a fountain, until they came to a halt in front of us. It seems they knew Molla Mehmed, and they kissed his hand. Then they again took off down the slope toward the watermills below the Khan’s Garden, and from there continued skiing uphill until they reached their starting point.

All of us lovers were astounded at this feat – it made me feel quite giddy. But now all the boys began skiing in a row, one behind the other like a flock of cranes. When they reached the bottom, suddenly all of them reversed direction and returned to the top, like a lightning bolt, skiing backwards! All the onlookers were lost in amazement. In short, that day Molla Mehmed demonstrated his prowess to me and to the people of Bitlis with these and other such tricks.

However, by God’s wisdom, despite his being such a skillful magician, as the saying goes, ‘When destiny strikes, the eyes go blind.’ Verse:



Through cautionary measures



You can’t thwart destiny;



Alhough you be cautious a thousand times,



Still what will be will be.





Also: There is no turning away His decree, and no preventing His judgement. In other words, there is no remedy for fate.

As we were viewing these marvellous spectacles, I happened to look behind and saw a white hand beckoning me from one of the windows of the Khan’s Garden. I ignored it and again became absorbed in watching the boys ski. A little later I glanced behind again, and once again a hand appeared at one of the Khan’s Garden windows and motioned rapidly several times. As I was pondering what this signal might mean, who should appear but Altı Kulaç – he was a tall Sarıca, all the taller because of his conical cap, which was a good fathom long, so they used to call him Altı Kulaç or ‘Six Fathoms’. He always went in front of the Khan and carried a huge battleaxe in his hand. Now this Altı Kulaç appeared at our sides like Destiny’s cloud.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ he said, ‘the noble Khan beckoned you several times from the Garden window grill with his own blessed hand, but you paid no attention and failed to come to the Garden. Get up now, he wants to see you, alone.’

‘Well then, let’s go,’ said I, as I started to get up from the snow. Molla Mehmed started to get up as well. Suddenly Altı Kulaç brought down his axe on the Molla’s head, giving him such a blow that his brain spurted out. My face and shoulders were spattered with it, even before I had completely got to my feet; and I leapt up from the spot in sheer terror, outleaping even Amr Ayyar. Altı Kulaç removed the Molla’s clothes and tossed his corpse down the cliff onto the snow below.

‘God’s mercy!’ I thought as I began to mount the slope. ‘One day in these valleys they will kill me too for some reason, just like this.’ Then I saw that the Khan had sent along his own horse for me. Praising God, I jumped up on the horse without even using the stirrups, and galloped before the Khan, cracking all sorts of jokes, and using dialect to make fun of ‘Molla Mehmed’s funeral obsequities’ and ‘meritorious intention against the valiant magician.’ All covered with blood and gore as I was, I greeted the Khan, saying, ‘May your Holy War prosper!’

‘My Evliya,’ said the Khan, ‘what happened to your face?’

‘The magician’s brain spattered on it,’ I said.

‘Well, Evliya, I did wave to you several times from the window, but you failed to come.’

‘My Khan, how was I to know what a naked waving hand meant? There was no body, only a waving hand. I remarked at it, and I was also freezing out there; but Molla Mehmed – may God not rest his soul – kept saying, ‘Please sit a while longer and I’ll show you another trick, so when you go back to Turkey you will sing my praises, and they’ll summon me to Turkey by royal decree to see for themselves what skills I possess’; and so he kept me sitting there in the cold.

‘But, my Khan,’ I continued, ‘what was that poor magician’s crime, that you had him killed in this manner?’

‘My Evliya,’ replied the Khan, ‘that damned infidel ate my bread for so long now, and drank cup after cup of rice-water sherbet from my own hand. But he paid no regard to the due of bread and salt. He conspired with Haydar Kethüda, saying: ‘You, Haydar Agha, make common cause with Melek Ahmed Pasha, and have him come to this town with the Van soldiery. I will plant a charm among the Khan’s troops assuring that they will be routed, and also plant a talisman among Melek Pasha’s troops assuring that they will be victorious and will kill the Khan. Then one of his sons will become khan; you, O knight Haydar, will become steward in perpetuity; and I will become kadi of Bitlis.’ That is exactly what he did when I was battling with Melek. So on that day my soldiers were routed like ants and snakes, and I had to flee to the mountains of Mudiki. God be praised, I have returned to my throne safe and sound, and now I have had that devil killed by Altı Kulaç’s axe.’

‘My Khan,’ said I, ‘may the spirit of Abu Muslim, the halberdier of Merv in Khorasan, rejoice, that Altı Kulaç with his axe has beheaded such a Yazidi. He got what he deserved! If that devil’s crime was as you say, my Khan, give me leave to go and piss on his corpse. And let me join the Kurdish rabble in stoning the devil – I’ll bury him with stones of damnation.’

At this, the Khan gave the order, and everyone in the town, great and small alike, even the servants and the Christian boys, came with one or two stones to ‘stone the devil’, leaving the magician’s filthy corpse buried beneath a hillock of several thousand stones.

But he was – may God rest his soul – a true master in the science of sorcery, more skilled than anyone I have seen in the seven climes. True, in 1058 (1648), the year Sultan Mehmed IV assumed the throne, when I accompanied the governor of Damascus, Kara Murtaza Pasha, on his expedition against the Druzes, there was in Acre a certain tightrope walker who was a veritable Mirzad in the science of magic. But this Molla Mehmed was a Koran commentator and a purveyor of Hadith, as well as having written books on magical science. Many of his skills were noted above, when he displayed them to Melek Ahmed Pasha and his retinue in the Khan’s palace. God have mercy on his soul.

This humble sinner and the Pasha’s poor canteen officer were full of anguish at these latest events. But what could we do? Verse:

Now and then I moan and sigh:



It’s not in my hands.



A captive of grief, I cry:



It’s not in my hands.





All we could do was continually recite: We belong to God, and to Him we shall return (2:156). The rigours of winter grew daily worse and the roads were blocked. The Pasha on his side, though dismissed from office, had not set foot out of Van. But I could not discuss going to the Pasha while I was with the Khan and his cronies. I did, however, mount horses every day, and make paths through snow and storms toward Rahva or toward Kefender. I would stop in at the farms belonging to the Khan or to the others, have a meal, and return to the city. If the Khan questioned me about it, I would say: ‘I went to your farm, my Khan,’ or, ‘I went to Arab Khalil Agha’s farm, and I ate kükü (omelette) pilav with rice-water.’ I never lied, but told him exactly where I had gone; and when they questioned their farm men, my reports were confirmed.

In this fashion I spent another month, in constant agitation, but I kept my feelings hidden. Day and night I busied myself praying and reciting the Koran, reading books of Hadith and the Koran-commentary of Daylami,44 and discussing matters of the Sharia as far as I was able with the Kurdish ulema. At the same time, I did not want them to think I had become some kind of humourless fanatic. So when I was in the Khan’s presence, or in the company of his sons Bedir and Nureddehir, or with the other tribal chiefs, I would play the clown, joking and jesting, and also would sing different kinds of songs, including kâr, nakş, savt, zikir, zecel, amel, tasnifat and mournful kavıl. And so they accepted me as one of their retinue.

By this time the new khan – i.e. Melek Ahmed Pasha’s protegé, Ziyaeddin Khan – would not let me out of his sight for a moment: he even made me sleep in his own room. For my part, I had despaired of them all and I took refuge in God alone. Terror had settled in my heart. I maintained vigilance night and day. Downstairs, in the stable, the horses were kept saddled at night, bedded down on some dried horse dung a cubit thick, while my servants slept with their clothes on and with all their weapons ready at hand. If I said ‘boo’ the horses were already saddled, all they had to do was remove their fetters and mount.





A notable adventure and a sorrowful calamity. In this town of Bitlis, and this mine of Iblis; our nights were spent like the Night of Power, our days like New Year’s Day; but our food was our own hearts’ blood, our comrades and companions were the invisible Saints. Finally, one evening, the youthful Ziyaeddin Khan proposed to the company, ‘Tonight, while everyone is asleep, let’s all go to the bath house, where we’ll apply henna and depilatory, get rubdowns with fütuni bath gloves, and have a party.’

On every side they applauded the idea. At sunset, we had our usual sumptuous banquet, and after the evening prayer we were informed that the bathhouse of the noble Khan – described above – had been adorned and prepared. Six of us – Ziyaeddin Khan, his eldest brother Bedir Bey, his next elder brother Nureddehir Bey, myself, the chief taster Mustafa Çelebi who was kinsman to the Sheikh of Urmia in Diyarbekir, and the story-reciter Molla Dilaver-i Isfahani – we six rascals entered that bath, which was the envy of kings. And a right royal time we had, somersaulting into the pools, swimming about left and right, joking and pranking. After nearly drowning in these sports, some superb slaveboys rubbed us down with bath gloves and soap. We lit pastilles of raw ambergris in censers, and savoured the fragrance. We quaffed all sorts of musk-flavoured beverages. Cleansed and pure, we retired to the dressing-room for some fresh air. Then we returned to the bath, where we were enjoying the white magic spectacle of the fountains and jets.

‘Brother,’ said Nureddehir Bey to Ziyaeddin Khan, ‘outside with my clothing is a canister with some aphrodisiac taffy. A person who eats just one ounce of it can engage in sexual intercourse seven times. If we each eat a little, we can also dispel the heat of our bodily humour; and if the spirit moves us, we can even get off on one another.’

‘If I eat some,’ said I jokingly, ‘I’m sure I could get off on my own brother – even on Molla Dilaver here!’

‘Tell Seyf Ali to bring that canister from the dressing room,’ ordered the Khan. Seyf Ali came into the bath fully clothed and handed over the canister to the rascal, Nureddehir Bey, who said, ‘You’re very stupid, treasure-boy Seyf Ali. How can we eat this taffy without a spatula? Give me that dagger stuck in your belt.’ Nureddehir grabbed the dagger from Seyf Ali’s belt. Then, with the canister in one hand and the pointed dagger in the other, he began to strut about the bath like a raging lion. I nearly fainted with fright, for I knew how many people Nureddehir had stabbed that day some time back when they cut up Haydar Kethüda, and I knew how many times he had stabbed Haydar Kethüda. Seeing him now, brandishing a dagger, I recalled that scene and was scared out of my wits. For all of us in the bath were naked – and there was Nureddehir with a naked dagger in his hand.

‘If you say this taffy is bad, let me eat some first,’ cried Nureddehir. Using the dagger, he removed a big chunk from the canister and ate it. Then he gave some to me. ‘O God, I take refuge in You alone,’ said I to myself, and, unclean as it was, I ate it. He took another chunk on the tip of the dagger, eyeing his brother the Khan. Suddenly he bounded over to the Khan, roaring like a lion, and offered the taffy in a menacing fashion, as though he were striking the Khan’s naked breast with the dagger.

‘Ah, brother,’ said the Khan, ‘with what kindly attitude and friendly disposition you give me this taffy.’ He tried to take the dagger together with the taffy from his brother’s hand, so he could feed himself.

‘Brother,’ said Nureddehir, ‘won’t you imbibe the Water of Life from the hand of Hızır?’ The Khan snatched the taffy from the tip of the dagger, tossed it in his mouth, and immediately plunged into the pool. I knew he would not swallow it, but spit it out into the pool instead. After frolicking a bit in the water, he came out and got dressed. Nureddehir gave some taffy to Molla Dilavere and Mustafa Çelebi as well, then they went out to the dressing room. The rest of us finished our ablutions and followed suit.

Retiring to Ziyaeddin Khan’s quarters, we lit incense of rose-water, aloes and ambergris, and enjoyed music and conversation until midnight. We also played gencefe which is known in the land of the infidels as ‘cards’. It consists of seventy or eighty rectangular painted cards – these particular ones were painted with lacquer and came from Persia – and the players form two teams. I was on the Khan’s team and had such good luck that I won seventy abbasis.

We finally tired of card-playing as well. Towels were brought, we washed our hands, then snacked on candies and sweetmeats, devouring so much that you would say, ‘These men are wholly made of sugar.’ Next came the fruit, fit for a padishah: plums, apricots, pomegranates, peaches, meleçe and abbasi and ordubari pears, and seven varieties of grapes. We washed this down with musk-scented juices made of sour cherry, Mardin plum, red Bukhara prune, and Shahraban pomegranate. After towels were brought and we washed our hands a final time, they ordered the bedclothes to be laid out. The Khan’s brothers Bedreddin and Nureddin-i-bi-din (i.e., Bedir and Nureddehir) left for their rooms along with the chief taster Miskin (i.e., Mustafa Çelebi) saying, ‘Good night, my Khan.’

Excusing myself to urinate, I too went out and made my way from room to room to the divan hall, where I unexpectedly ran into Kara Mehmed Kethüda – he was made steward to the new khan after Haydar Agha was killed. This Kara Mehmed was on night-patrol duty in the divan hall, with a guard of 500 musketeers who were conversing pleasantly and playing various instruments.45

I passed through them, greeting this one and that one, and proceeded downstairs to the stable where, as was my custom, I inspected my horses and gave instructions to my slaveboys.

When I returned to the Khan’s room I saw that he was lying in his bedclothes on a couch next to the fireplace. Molla Dilaver had fallen off while reciting a story, and was now sleeping the sleep of the Seven Sleepers and snoring in the rehavi musical mode. His bed was situated at the foot of the closet, while mine had been laid out near the door, as usual. As I lay my head on the pillow with a sigh, I prayed from the bottom of my heart to God the Dispeller of cares. The Khan’s coffee-server, a fine lad named Rustam, who was lying next to the fireplace at the foot of the Khan’s couch, was also dozing like Rustam’s father Zal.46 All of them snoring away like pigs made me quite depressed. As I was consulting our inborn companions – bile and melancholia and satanic whisperings – the Khan interrupted my dark thoughts: ‘Evliya, why did you go out?’

‘My Padishah,’ I replied, ‘urination – kertem pereset.’ He giggled and said, ‘Evliya, what language is this kertem pereset?’

‘My Khan,’ I said, ‘it is called ‘male Persian’ and was handed down from my forefather Alkıravün Çelebisi.’ Laughing out loud, he came out from under the covers and sat up on the couch.

‘I can’t sleep, my dear Evliya. My heart is on fire. Come lie down over here, let’s chat like working-men. I can confide in you. Also, you have been my tutor for some time now. What do you think about the situation here in Kurdistan?’

‘It can’t be helped, my Khan,’ I replied. ‘God knows, the rising star of this town of Bitlis is fixed in the constellation of Scorpio, the mansion of Mars, fiery. Therefore Mars the executioner always has his sword drawn and ready to strike in this town. It can’t be helped, my Khan. That is the way of this old, perishing, workhouse of a world.’

Well, we talked for two entire hours – how can I record every word? Finally he said, ‘My Evliya, I swear by God, if it weren’t the dead of winter, I would cross Mt Kuskunkıran in one night, and would rub my face at the horse’s hoof of my father Melek Ahmed Pasha in Van. For me it would be a relief even to wash dishes in his service.’

‘God forbid, my Khan,’ I said; ‘if you submit to the Ottomans, they will treat you well for a few months, but after that they won’t look in your face. Now, tell me why you are so sad?’

‘Don’t you see how they cut up the man my father Melek made my steward? And how many of my men they have thrown from the castle cliff? And didn’t you see just now how threatening Nureddehir was, when he gave me the taffy on the dagger?’ He heaved a sigh.

‘My Khan,’ I said, ‘the taffy must have affected your brother, and that is why he was so excited when he offered some to you.’

‘You don’t understand, Evliya. Let’s leave it at that.’ He lay down and pulled the quilt over his head.

I too returned to my bed, saying, ‘O perverse and perishable world! That is how sultans’ deputies act – and the sultans themselves. What comfort or joy is there in that? As the verse has it, Truly, the greatest sultanate is to be free of marriage bonds.’ I crawled under the covers fully clothed, as usual, having just loosened my waist-cloth but now removed my trousers. But Satan’s whisperings again prevented me from sleeping. God knows, it was two hours past midnight.





Upshot of the calamitous adventure. I was lying in bed, and my eyes were on the door. Suddenly, who should appear there but Nureddehir Bey, with a waistband round his middle and his sleeves rolled up. Softly he crept in, stretched and yawned, cracked his knuckles and snapped his lower vertebra, then fingered his dagger and straightened his belt. As I lay there watching, he first came over to me, saying, ‘Evliya the dervish. What are you doing in this land?’

My heart was in my throat. Taking refuge in God, I gave a snort as if in my sleep, and began to snore like a pig, just as the others were. I was really trumpeting in a comical fashion. Seeing me thus, Nureddehir said, ‘This dervish’s beauty-sleep is also like the sleep of swine,’ and he passed me by.

Moving on to the story-reciter Molla Dilaver at the foot of the closet, he said, ‘You pimp from Isfahan, get to work, or go to your house down in the city and sleep there!’

He passed him also and went over to the coffee-server Rustam, lying next to the Khan, and looked him over too. Then his eye fell on his dear brother the Khan, who was lying on the couch and slumbering peacefully, ‘bedded on roses and covered with hyacinths.’ He glanced about furtively, then returned to gaze at the Khan. I was peering out from under my coverlet like a dog from under the skirting-board of a privy, wondering if they had some private matter to discuss.

Suddenly he drew the dagger from his belt, flung off the Khan’s gold-embroidered quilt, and gave him a kick, shouting, ‘Get up, you catamite!’

Groggy with sleep, the Khan opened his eyes and saw that it was his own dear brother. As he cried out, Nureddehir plunged the sharp dagger in his breast, then again at the midriff, twisting it into his belly. Grasping in terror and futility for his own dagger, the Khan fell to the floor, where his brother stabbed him once again.

Now the coffee-server Rustam got to his feet, crying, ‘O my Bey, what have you done to my Khan? You have doomed my Khan and his house, O Nureddehir the damned!’ They began to struggle, but Nureddehir stuck the dagger into his midriff with such a terrific blow that Rustam’s blood came gushing out and his guts trailed down to his feet.

Nothing daunted, I myself was about to leap into the fray, but I must have fainted, for I did not have the strength to move from my place. Meanwhile the poor Khan was struggling for his life, wrestling with Nureddehir as Rustam tried to hold him from the other side. But the Khan, with his delicate frame, was no match for the powerful and merciless Nureddehir, who got the upper hand, and left him as full of holes as a powder-maker’s sieve. In the end, that highway robber Death, who cuts all threads of Hope, befell his victim; the Khan quaffed the poison cup from the pointed dagger at the hand of Nureddin-i-bi-din (Nureddin the Irreligious), and was transported from this abode of vanity to the palace of joy and eternity; may God have mercy on his soul.

With the Khan lying lifeless on one side and Rustam on the other, Nureddehir tore through the treasury-room door and recklessly began to open the cupboards and chests. God be praised, I came to my senses and, shooting from under the bedclothes like a basilisk, darted through seven doors out to the divan hall, where I emerged holding my trousers band as though I were going out to urinate. The sentries were all half asleep.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ said one, ‘is it near morning?’

‘Is Nureddehir conferring in there with the Khan?’ asked another.

‘The conference is over,’ I replied, ‘I am going to pee.’ I flew down the twenty steps from the divan hall to the stable.

‘Up my lads! Hurry! Mount, you bastards!’ I cut the horses’ fetters with my dagger, bridled my own horse right away, and girt on my sword. My slaveboy named Hüseyn was up and ready, God bless him; but the others were still rubbing their eyes and tying on their waistbands, and I saw they would be of no use. Kazım, however, was also ready, since he too slept in his clothes. He grabbed his sword, which he kept next to his bed, clapped it to his waist, took his musket in his hand, and released his horse’s fetters. I grabbed two muskets in addition to my sword, and also attached a battleaxe to my belt. We tightened the horses’ girths and the three of us mounted – myself and my two slaveboys – leaving behind my other four slaveboys, six horses, and a great deal of money and clothing.

From the Khan’s Garden we flung headlong down the slope, swooping hawklike over ice and snow, clattering over the ice to the bottom of Değirmenler valley. There I shouted to Menteş Bölükbaşı, ‘Hey brother! Mount! They’ve gone too far!’ The fellow apparently was not used to getting up before dawn. ‘They’ve killed the Khan,’ I cried, ‘what are you waiting for?’ He came to his senses, flew down to his stable, mounted his horse bareback using a spurred bit, took his sword and musket from his servant and threw his fur coat over his shoulders.

With extreme caution and much difficulty, we passed through the Husrev Pasha market in the dark. What a huge town this city of Bitlis was! It took us some time to get up through the town. When we reached the point known as Butcher’s Fountain we heard wails and cries from the direction of the Khan’s Garden, also musket shots. Finally we came out to the Rahva plain. The snow was as high as a minaret. Fortunately, I had mounted every day and had opened paths, trampling down the snow drifts with five or six of my servants as a daily exercise. So the four of us pushed through; now at a jog-trot, now at a gallop, now at a run; often sinking in the snow, and looking back in the dark.

An hour before dawn we reached Tatvan Han on the shore of Lake Van. An agha of Pehleli Ahmed Pasha had recently been posted there as commander. We asked him for news of Melek Ahmed Pasha.

‘You can reach him tomorrow near Adilcevaz castle.’

‘Please, my Agha,’ said I, ‘we have urgent business with Melek Ahmed Pasha. We have to go on the double!’ He gave us a ten-man escort and we set off immediately along the shore of Lake Van, keeping to the sandy beach where there was no snow. Postponing the dawn prayer to a more opportune time, we galloped for an hour, when, glancing back, we could just make out forty or fifty horsemen advancing over the white snow like eagles seeking their prey. We wondered whether they were fugitives like ourselves, or else a party sent to pursue us, and we climbed a snow-covered dune to take a look.

Dawn was just breaking. Behind this group of fifty or so horsemen another group appeared of roughly 100 mounted troops. As we watched, they caught up with the first group and the two forces engaged in battle. Finally the second troop cut down all the earlier group of fifty, stripped them of their clothes, and rounded up their horses. ‘Power to our cruppers and blessings on our whips!’ we cried as we decided to flee.

‘My brother,’ I said to my old friend Menteş Bölükbaşı, ‘they have seen our hoofprints, they will pursue us too. God help us! If only we can reach Ahlat castle.’

We started off again, but the ten-man escort we got from the commander of Tatvan stayed behind at the shore of Lake Van. As we fled for our lives and cried blessings to our whips, we glanced behind. Those assassins caught up with our ten escorts. They gave no quarter, but cut them all down before our eyes, and began to gather their mounts and trappings. The four of us cried to God for help and pushed our horses to the limit.

Suddenly my poor Hüseyn’s horse swerved and began to shy. ‘God help you, my lad, press on!’ I cried. ‘If the horse shies, dismount, throw off your weapons, and run along the shore. God willing, you’ll reach such a haven as Ahlat castle.’ No matter how much he whipped it, the horse kept shying, so he dismounted and began to run. My poor Hüseyn! Those Rozhiki devils caught up with him, bared their swords, and mercilessly cut off the lad’s head. Terrified, the three of us who remained let the reins loose and galloped as hard as we could, fleeing along the shore of Lake Van. God be praised, our horses were in top condition, and went like lightning; for we had withheld their straw to make them lean, and we had mounted every day in Bitlis and trained them hard by pushing through the snow.

By now the world-illuminating sun had risen out of a breach in the firmament and stood a spear’s height, casting its rays over the snow. It revealed Papşen Han to our left and Ahlat Castle ahead. Those damned Kurds were still pouring after us, although quite some distance behind, as we trotted like Tatars and flung ourselves exhausted into Ahlat castle, reciting the verse: And he who enters it is secure (3:97). I immediately dismounted and shut the castle gate behind us.

3. Diplomacy in Split (Spalato)





Description of the walled city of Split


When the castle came into view, we sent ahead Baba Ahmedzade Baba Ismail Agha. Suddenly a party of infidels appeared to greet us – 1000 musketeers on foot and 400 horsemen. They brought us in procession to the guesthouse called Nazarete (lazaretto) in the lower suburb. It was grandly furnished. As soon as we settled in, they fired 1000 cannons to demonstrate their majesty. And they sent a young and princely officer, with a retinue of 200 infidel musketeers, to serve us. He brought forty or fifty porcelain dishes piled with various breakfast items. We ate them, but they were mostly sugary confections.

The next day another officer came and, in accordance with their ancient pomp and ceremony, invited me to the quarters of the general. Together with my armed retinue, all of us mounted our Arab steeds and proceeded at a slow pace as far as the skirt of the castle, where their captain of the guards told our servants to leave their weapons before entering. This struck me as an outrageous demand.

‘According to our kanun it is disgraceful to break our formation and enter unarmed,’ I said. ‘If you do not allow us to enter the castle in our formation we will go back.’

After a good deal of disputation they eventually let us go in with our weapons. When we arrived at the council hall, the general rose and we took our places, I on one chair and the general on another. I kissed the letter, placed it on my head, and gave it to the general, hand to hand. He had it read by an interpreter and its contents explained.

‘God forbid,’ he said, ‘that we should do anything on this frontier contrary to the treaty, or that we should repair and garrison castles that you have destroyed. Only we do fear the Ottomans, and so we do keep in good repair those castles that are ours of old. They should just leave us alone. But look how many of your troops have been sacking our territory for the past five months. Moreover it is recorded in our registers that you have taken 3,000 of our men captive over the past six months.’

‘Well,’ I replied, ‘you are on bad terms with the frontier population. For their part, they cannot sit quiet but mount raids and take captives and booty.’

‘God grant that this endless conflict on Crete will be resolved, either in your favour or in ours,’ he said. ‘As long as there is no peace there, neither you nor we will live in peace here.’

After much discussion I presented him the prayer-rug and a pile of köse (?) turban-cloth that the Pasha had sent, saying, ‘Your intimate friend, the courageous Pasha, requests that you give us the Ottoman prisoners languishing in your dungeon: our chamberlain, two of our janissaries, and six of our Bosnian gazis.’

He immediately had all ten youths brought and delivered them to me. The fact is that the Pasha had no inkling of all this. I had learned about these prisoners from some merchants in Split and requested them extempore. God be praised, the general did not hesitate, and he gave me an Ottoman horse as well.

‘Please do not be offended,’ he said, ‘that we lodged you in the lazaretto and not in the castle. It is our kanun that all guests and all merchants be lodged in that quarter for forty days before mingling with our people. We have them stay there for forty days to determine whether anyone has the plague. But we brought you to our presence after one day.’

They then served a grand feast, laid out on tall benches called tirpeza (i.e., table). There were various roasted meats; also vinegar stews cooked with parsley, mint and celery root; and sweetmeats. After dining we washed our hands according to Ottoman ceremonial and drank a goblet of musk-flavoured sherbets. Then we proceeded in formation back to our lodgings outside the wall and began a leisurely tour of the castle and the suburb.

This castle, according to their own report, was conquered by Farhad Pasha and Husrev Pasha during the reign of Sultan Süleyman, but was occupied by the warlike Franks in the same year and is now in the hands of the Venetians. It is a solidly built pentagonal fortress, with a thick three-layered wall, on the shore of the Venetian Gulf (i.e. Adriatic Sea). Because it is quite ancient it is repaired every year and the stones whitewashed so that it resembles a swan.

All the munitions are in a state of readiness. There is a series of great redoubts, sticking out like hedgehog quills toward land and sea, that protect the harbour and the Klisz strait. Each of these has forty or fifty balaramada guns, and each of these guns shoots cannon balls weighing 40 or 50 okkas.

The harbour is spacious enough to accommodate 200 bargias, galleons, carracks and galleys.

Indeed, there were two Venetian barges in this harbour that I would need a separate book to describe properly. Suffice it to say that each of them was like a mountain, with ten balaramada guns at the prow and ten at the stern. The three masts – at the prow, in the middle, and at the stern – were topped with pennants and flags depicting the cross and Saint Mark. fifty oars on the right side and fifty on the left were pulled by Muslim captives. There were 100 wind-sails, each with four infidels lying ready. And each oar had eight Muslims ready to pull. 300 armed infidel warriors stood ready at the prow and at the stern – Croatians, Slovenians, Carinthians, Montenegrans, Clementi Albanians and Uskoks (Christian Bosnians). These barges are like floating castles, conveying merchants and goods from this port of Split to Venice. The Venetian infidels possess six such barges, such as no king has ever had.

Around this harbour are kavata towers, meaning guard towers.

On the sea side the castle wall is a single layer, since there is no fear of attack from the sea; and two gates lead out to the harbour. But on the land side the wall is fortified in three layers. The moat, carved out of the rock, is very deep; and armed infidels stand ever ready between the layers of the threefold iron gates on the land side, stopping anyone from crossing the moat bridge.

The citadel is situated atop a hill and is quite small, but the main parts of the castle are filled layer on layer with houses. The lower castle has three large monasteries and several ancient churches with their idolatrous Christian ceremonial. There are 300 shops. I was told that there were baths as well, but I did not see them. The grandest of the houses is the general’s palace. The merchants have magazines along the harbour filled with sheep’s-wool and broadcloth, satins and brocades, silken and leathern stuffs. The trade in these commodities is very brisk, since this port is an entrepôt for goods going to Bosnia and thence to Turkey. The commerce is carried out in finely constructed stone buildings near the magazines.

Beyond the walls on all three sides, and stretching as far as the mountains of Clissa (Klisz) and the orchards of Salona, are 77,000 orchards – that is the number they cite – mainly olive groves laid out like Persian avenues, also figs, pomegranates, pears, lemons, oranges and citrons.

As this city is on the gulf coast the climate is mild. It is famous for the lovely lads and maids who sit in the shops selling their secret wares. We viewed them in the bazaar, and indeed the doe-eyed girls with their bright faces and sweet speech drive their lovers mad, as in the verse:

This is a spectacle at which



The spectator loses his wits.





Reportedly there are also prostitutes in the taverns. As for the men, they are very slim and elegant, with black vests and conical black hats.

We toured this city for three days. As we were resting on the fourth, the general showed up at our quarters with twenty trays of sugary confections. I rose to greet him, then we sat knee to knee in our secluded corner and ate the food. I presented the general with one gold-embroidered turban and two multicoloured Kaya Sultan handkerchiefs. He was extremely pleased with these gifts and put one of the handkerchiefs on his hat.

For his part, he presented me with ten black Sarajevo fur pieces – these are astrakhan lambskins black as beaver skins; ten suits of varicoloured broadcloth; ten rolls of varicoloured Frankish satins; 300 Venetian scudos – these are silver coins weighing ten drams apiece; one watch; one spyglass; one book with illustrations of the world called Mappa Mundi; and 100 musk-scented ducats. When he left he gave each of my forty-seven servants five ducats and one piece each of broadcloth and fine stuff. He had former obligations toward Baba Ahmedzade İsma‘il Bey, and also feared him since they lived in close proximity; so he gave him one purse of guruş (i.e. scudos) and one suit of broadcloth, and also sent his father Baba Ahmed 100 gold pieces and one suit of broadcloth.

We bid farewell to the general and he went to his palace while we continued pursuing our own pleasures.

I record here some phrases of their Frankish tongue that I got from their interpreters who spoke excellent Turkish.





Language of the warlike Franks. Their language is called Italian (Talyan). Now the kings of Spain, France, Genoa, the grand-duchy of Livorno, Portugal, Dunkerque, Denmark, Holland, and England – all of their peoples are Franks, but some are Catholic (Papişta), some Protestant (Luteryan), and some of the Italian sect, but they are all Christians; although the Swedes, the Czechs, the Karelians and the people of Sol (?) are Magians. And the Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Wallachians and Moldavians all have different languages. But the above-mentioned Franks all speak Italian; although each one has its own special dialect and terminology, and they communicate with one another only with interpreters. The most eloquent is the language of the Frankish Venetians. To be sure, there is an old saying that Arabic is eloquence, Persian is elegance, Turkish is an offence, and all other languages are filth. But the Venetian tongue is the sweetest of them all. To begin with the numerals:

uno 1 duy 2 tire 3 kotrá 4 çinko 5 sey 6 sete 7 ot 8 neve 9 deçe 10.

marya the name of Mother Maria sanmarka name of saints pan bread akwa water bono çorno Good morning bono zeribonani Good morning indeed vino wine porko pig mele honey venko Come! pos Sit! Persiade duka Where have you been? mela apple esta dona bella Is your daughter pretty? bardaş boy be ko fotut fotut ladona – begging your pardon – Let me fuck your wife kosa voli What do you want? dolim po di pan I want a piece of bried tirom pürolates I’ll split your head kane dog un çekinno tedonero I’ll give you a gold piece senta baş bardaş Don’t move, boy! mancá merda Eat shit! manca du merdo You eat the shit!

In fact manca means ‘shit’ in the language of the Franks. What does it mean that they say their food is shit? To one who is a Muslim it should be called food, and then it should be eaten.47





Praise of the musk-scented Venetian gold pieces (i.e. ducats). According to their own correct report, it is truly alchemy, since no wicked king has ever possessed such gold. That is why in Turkey gilded silver vessels are white (?); but this Venetian gold is very red in colour and gives gilded copper and silver a reddish sheen. Indeed, on the gold pieces that in olden times they struck as votive offerings for Mawlana there is a staff with a forked banner at the top that is blood-red in colour, though of gold. If a strong youth rubs it in his hand it rolls and crumbles like dough. If one (of those old gold pieces) were found it would serve to gild 50 (today). In the period of Sultan Ahmed (reg. 1603–17) I saw many of them in my father’s possession. But these days we never see them – even viziers don’t have them. We get by with pennies and coppers weighing ten a dram. God grant us blessings! What has happened to our zeal for Islam? We have to get our currency into good order!

I asked a number of their knowledgeable monks and patriarchs: ‘Why, when his holiness Mawlana Jalaladdin Rumi was alive, did you sent 10,000 of those gold pieces every year as votive offerings?’ Here is what they told me, ‘Our doge (pirinc-pirim) was a knowledgeable person. When he heard about the saintly revelations and miracles of Shams (Tabrizi) and Mawlana, he wondered what sort of man he was and sent an envoy with gifts. When our envoy arrived in Konya and visited Mawlana, they received the gifts and then entertained the envoy according to their ceremonial with ecstatic dance and music and singing.

‘The musicians then came before Mawlana and held out a tambourine for a reward. Mawlana, as our envoy watched, stretched out his right hand with the sleeve of his green cloak toward the west and said ‘Bismillahi – In the name of God!’ At once a handful of Venetian ducats poured down into the tambourine. The ducats, which were red-hot as embers, burned the skin of the tambourine and fell onto the ground. When our envoy saw this he was struck with amazement and carefully recorded the exact time of the incident. The musicians took the gold and left.

‘Our envoy took leave of Mawlana and returned to Venice. As soon as he arrived he was informed that a white hand in a green cloak had appeared at the wall of the well-fortified mint and, through a hole in the wall that also suddenly appeared, took a handful of ducats that were being forged in the fire; and that this had occurred at the exact moment which he had recorded in Konya.’

Now the envoy told the doge all he had witnessed in Konya; and the prisoners working in the mint also testified that 10,000 ducats had been taken by a white hand at the very time the envoy had recorded it in Konya. The doge, after consultation, decided to send 10,000 ducats with depiction of the banner every year to Mawlana in Konya. The Mevlevis, for their part, accepted the gift on the grounds, citing the line of verse, Property of infidels is permitted for believers and distributed it as alms to the poor.





Description of the Venetian gold piece (ducat). On the Venetian ducat, the tall figure to the right (sic; error for left) of the staff is Mawlana whom they began to depict on their ducats after the occurrence of the saintly miracle (recorded above). The figure opposite, to the right of the staff, with the squat headgear like that of Hacivad,48 is their doge (pirinc-pirim) i.e. their king and chief of forty beys. Only the doge’s headgear is a cap not a crown.

Jesus (on the reverse) has sheep’s-wool stockings on his feet that somehow made their way from Edessa to Venice. One of the forty infidel beys becomes doge and on their false festival days dons the headgear and keeps it on his head thereafter. The staff on the ducat signifies that ‘The staff of Moses and the stockings of Jesus are with us.’ The inscriptions along the edge of this side of the coin (the obverse) are the names of Mawlana and the doge.

But on the reverse, the single tall figure inside the dotted oval is Jesus. He is surrounded by twelve dots with clawed edges representing the twelve constellations of the zodiac; or they are twelve stars standing for Jesus’s twelve disciples; because the science of astrology is more advanced in Venice than in other infidel lands. The inscriptions around the figure of Jesus are blessings and greetings upon Jesus, in Latin, as follows:

[2 lines empty]

After confirming the information about this ducat and other matters, and touring the city to our satisfaction, we got letters and gifts for the Pasha from the general – including muskets, twenty rolls of brocaded silk and seven rolls of varicoloured broadcloth – plus one horse and one suit of broadcloth for each of the men released from captivity. The general accompanied us for one hour, then we bade farewell on the highway and he returned to Split.

47 The translation of this passage is quite conjectural.

4. The bandit Yano





There was an infidel named Yano in the Sheshan hills who was pillaging the city of Manastır. It was impossible to collect the money due from the villages in those hills. So I left all my attendants behind and rode up Mt Sheshan with a single slaveboy. Adventure of this humble one. After three hours an infidel with a mace appeared.

‘Hey Turk,’ he said. ‘What are you doing in this mountain?’

‘I have come to my friend Yano Bey. I must see him.’

The infidel went off, then came back and said, ‘Come with me.’ We dismounted and proceeded through thick forest. Five or six hundred infidels lined our path, each with a pike and a mace in his hands and two or three muskets in his belt. On both sides men were roasting kebabs of lamb and pork, perhaps 300 animals. Several hundred tailors were cutting out clothing for the infidels from the cloth they had taken on their raids from the city of Manastır and the fair at Maskoluri. I viewed all this activity as I advanced.

‘Hello, my good man, welcome!’ cried a warriorlike infidel, as he rose to his feet. He had a feather in his cap, a dark brown vest, and was clean-shaven.

‘Thanks,’ I replied. ‘I’ve come to see your smiling face.’

‘How did you come up this mountain so fearlessly?’

‘He who comes on foot is not put to death – that is so in the religion of Muhammad and in the religion of Jesus – but I have come to die. The villages in this mountain still owe three yük of akçe for the grain requisition. The kadi has given a court order. What if Melek Ahmed Pasha says ‘Where is my money?’ and we say ‘I haven’t got it!’ and he says ‘Where is the kadi’s appeal?’ and the kadi hasn’t given an appeal? Then Melek Ahmed Pasha will put me in prison and bleed me for the money owed in this mountain. So fearing for my life I put my head behind my saddle and came to you. Do as you like – here is my head and my soul!’

‘You are not to blame,’ Yano replied. ‘It is all the fault of your infidel kadi. He gave the order, and the harassers of the province along with the kadis are oppressing the peasants. But God willing, we will kill that kadi and make an example of him. Look here, young man, do you know who I am?’

‘No,’ I said.

‘Don’t you recognise me? I am Yano, the one with the sherbet shop near the Mahmud Pasha bath in Istanbul. One time you withheld my tax receipt from the customs agent, Ali Agha.’

‘Now I know who you are,’ I said, and since it was in a good cause, I added, ‘my dear friend!’ We kissed each other, exchanged pleasantries, ate a lamb kebab. Then he loaded three yük of akçe on a packhorse, and also gave us ten rolls of Prankona cotton, fifty pieces of satin, ten pieces of Frankish printed cloth, and ten packhorse loads of tobacco; also 100 Venetian ducats for myself, and an outfit of fine broadcloth for each of my forty attendants down below. He even accompanied me down to the valley and made sure I had rejoined my attendants before going back up, and he left all the packhorses behind.

My attendants were stunned. I gave them the broadcloth, which made them quite happy. God be praised, thanks to this adventure I got 300 yük of akçe instead of 100. So in this fashion I collected the due of the kadi-district of Cum‘abazarı.





VOLUME SIX





Hungary and the German Campaign





DURING THE TRANSYLVANIA campaign, Evliya’s adventures include a comical if embarrassing incident on the battlefield. In February 1662, Melek Ahmed Pasha is recalled to Istanbul to become the deputy grand vizier, and Evliya is sent to Albania to collect the Pasha’s debts. His description of Shkodër includes information on the Albanian language. On his way back to Sofia, he stops to observe the Samakov iron works. He finally returns to Istanbul in April of that year.

In the following year, Melek Pasha dies. Left patronless, Evliya joins the German campaign in March 1663 and travels extensively in Hungary. Following the successful siege of Uyvar, he claims to have ridden off with 40,000 Tatar horsemen on a raid into Western Europe as far as Amsterdam.

His account of this apocryphal raid (it all takes place between Oct. 12 and Oct. 22 of 1663!) allows him to imagine what Western Europe is like, and what a large and ruthless Tatar force might accomplish if it made a concerted effort in that direction. His tongue-in-cheek attitude makes it difficult to judge the degree to which he is critiquing Tatar predatory habits and satirising the tall tales of travel writers.

Returning to Hungary and reality, he participates in several other military campaigns and a mission to Dubrovnik, with more reflections on the Venetians (cf. Volume 5, selection 3). His travels in the region include a stop at Mostar where he views the famous bridge.





1. An incident on the battlefield





A strange and comical adventure, a wondrous and foolish gaza. This adventure happened to your humble servant. If it is bad manners to relate it, I hope to be covered with the skirt of forgiveness.

After the battle, feeling the call of nature I retired to a lonely spot, loosened my drawers and was busy relieving myself when, from a thicket just above my head, I heard a rustle and a snap. Before I could determine what this noise meant, an infidel soldier, fearing for his life, suddenly hurled himself from a low rock just above my head and landed on top of me, so that I plopped right into my own filth. I had been holding on to the rein of my horse, but the horse started and stood off at a distance. For a moment I lost my wits: there I was, topsy-turvy with that infidel, my belt and drawers swimming at my feet and my clothes all covered in shit – I almost became the shitty martyr.

Thank God, I recovered my wits and wrestled with that infidel like Mahmud Piryar Veli until I was on top. Baring my dagger, I stabbed him several times in the neck and breast, then cut off his head. By this time I was soaked in blood as well as in shit, and I had to laugh, seeing that I had become the shitty gazi. I used the dagger to wipe the shit off my clothes, then began to draw my drawers together when suddenly a brave youth came panting to the rock above my head and said, ‘My friend, I was chasing that infidel whom you just killed through the mountains. Fearing for his life he hurled himself on top of you and you cut off his head. Now that head belongs to me!’

I was still tying up my drawers. ‘Well,’ I replied, ‘take this head,’ and I showed him my little brother who was born together with me (i.e. my penis).

‘What an ill-mannered man you are,’ said the elegant fellow and, despairing of the head, he went on his way.

As I was pulling off the infidel’s filth-spattered dolman with its silver buttons, and his drawers, I discovered 105 Hungarian gold pieces and one ring and 40 Thalers in his waistband. Putting these items in my saddlebag I mounted my horse – his name was Hamis – and deposited the head before Ismail Pasha.

‘May the enemies’ misfortunate heads always roll like this one,’ I said, kissed his hand, and stood at attention. Those next to me moved off because of the smell.

‘My Evliya,’ said Ismail Pasha, ‘you smell strangely of shit.’

‘Don’t ask, my lord, what calamities have befallen me!’ And I recounted my adventures blow by blow. All the officers at that victory celebration laughed uproariously. Ismail Pasha too was tremendously pleased. He awarded me fifty gold pieces and a silver turban-crest, and I cheered up considerably.





2. Shkodër (Scutari)





From here (Lezha) we set off westwards, crossing the Drin River, and journeyed to the walled city of Shkodër. It was founded by Iskandar Dhu’l-qarnayn and thus was called Iskenderiye (Alexandria). It was subsequently taken over and enlarged by Spain, then passed from the king of Puglia into the hands of the doges of Venice. When Mehmed the Conqueror received the dreadful news that the Venetians had begun to loot and plunder the lands around Skopje, Prishtina and Vushtrria, he resolved at once to pacify the region and, arriving with a huge expeditionary force, he conquered the fortress from the Venetians in the year 883 (1478) after a siege of forty days and nights. He then made it the capital of a separate sancak in the province Rumeli, bestowing it as a hereditary land grant (ocaklık) upon Yusuf Bey, the first sancak-bey of Shkodër. And so its rulers are still known as Yusuf Bey Oğulları.

The present governor, Mehmed Pasha, came out to meet us and accompanied us into the fortress where we were quartered in the house of the castle warden, (—) Agha. When Mehmed Pasha had read the affectionate letters I gave him from Melek Pasha he expressed delight. ‘God willing,’ he cried, ‘I shall meet my obligations and repay my debt within ten days and you may continue your journey.’ He gave me a purse of guruş for bath-expenses and a set of clothing, and gave my thirty companions and servants ten guruş each. We frequently resorted to the Yusufbeyzade palace in a village called Bushat, where we were well received and had an excellent time. But we always returned to Shkodër because the Venetian infidels were up in arms.

There are three Iskenderuns or Alexandrias in the Ottoman Empire. One is this Albanian Iskenderiye (Shkodër). The second, called Iskenderun, is on the shore of the Mediterranean one caravan stage from Aleppo and serves as the port for that city. The third is Alexandria in Egypt, which in Greek is called Alexandria Pyrgos or Alexander’s Castle.

According to the kanun of Süleyman Khan, the Bey possesses an imperial has worth 459,200 akçe, plus 19 zeamets and 205 timars, and for every 3000 akçe he must provide one armed retainer. These, together with the troops of the cavalry marshal, troop commander and constable, and the Pasha himself, provide a force of 4000 select armoured soldiers. In time of war, this force is put under the command of the vizier or else the sancak-beys of Rumeli. And indeed, all of these brave gazis were with us during the Transylvania campaigns.

The sancak also provides forty purses for the Pasha who, with the help of 1000 warriors under his command, guards and defends the sancak. Among the Sharia authorities in Shkodër are the şeyhülislam, the nakibüleşraf along with various notables and descendants of the Prophet, the kadi with a salary level of 150 akçe, the steward of the sipahis, the commander of the janissaries, the castle warden along with the garrison soldiers, the market inspector, the voyvoda, the toll collector, the chief engineer, the mayor, and the poll-tax official.





Plan of the fortress of Shkodër. It is situated upon a lofty and very steep cliff overlooking a great lake called Boyana. It is square-shaped, somewhat slanted. The fortress is constructed of chiseled stonework and is fully functional, with no obstructing higher ground in the vicinity. Though small, it is strong and impregnable. It has no moat on the lake side or on any other side, but does have many towers and crenellated battlements. There are two gates, one facing east, the other overlooking Küçük Ova. Inside this second gateway is the shrine of Muyo Baba Sultan. Within the fortress there are few houses and only one congregational mosque, i.e., the radiant mosque of Sultan Mehmed, covered in tiles and constructed in the old style. There are seven or eight cisterns which fill up with rain water. Descending from the fortress to Lake Boyana are water channels known only to those in the fortress. They cannot be seen by the enemy outside. It is through these channels that they fetch water during sieges. There are no shops inside the fortress, only 100 houses for the garrison soldiers and storage bins for wheat. There are also ammunition depots and fine imperial cannons. It might be possible for an enemy to bombard the fortress from Mount Tarabosh, which looms above on the other side of Lake Boyana, but they would need cannons forty spans in length. Smaller guns pose no threat, because the lake is in between. At the foot of the fortress, near the cliffs down at the lake, there are fishing weirs built on pinewood pilings. These weirs are administered on commission from the fortress garrison.





The open town (varoş) of the fortress of Shkodër. The town outside the walls consists of 1800 one- and two-story stonework houses with slate and tiled roofs and surrounded by vineyards and gardens. The inhabitants are all Muslim. There are fifteen quarters, of which the best known are: Bayezid Khan quarter, Ali Bey quarter, Hüseyn Bey quarter, Iskele-başı (Docks) quarter, Mufti quarter, Kara Hasan quarter, and the Mahkeme (Courthouse) quarter at the end of the bazaar.





Mosques of the monotheists. There are eleven prayer-niches. First is the mosque of Sultan Bayezid II the Saint at the end of the bazaar. In front of it is a well with delicious water and an iron chain. It is definitely the finest of the mosques, an exquisite building with a tiled roof, and has a large congregation. Then comes the mosque of Hüseyn Bey in the Ali Bey quarter; the Mufti mosque at the Docks; and the mosque of Kara Hasan. These are all well-known and radiant mosques with tiled roofs. Aside from these, there are seventy other prayer-houses.

There are seven medreses, each congregational mosque having its own, but there are no special schools of Koran recitation or Hadith. There are (—) primary schools, six dervish convents, and (—) hans of which the Ulama Pasha Han is the strongest in construction and the most imposing, with all kinds of precious furnishings. There is a single very spacious and attractive bathhouse that gets its water from Lake Boyana by means of a water wheel. There are 500 shops in the covered market, all the skills and handicrafts being represented. The fish-market at the lakeside is well maintained and furnished.





Clothing of the manly men. They all wear broadcloth garments and tight-buttoned trousers with teybend silk waistband and Kubadi shoes. On their heads they wear Albanian kalpaks made of sable. Learned scholars and rakish youths alike carry kortela knives in their belts, and the youths are never to be seen without their swords and shields.





Clothing of the demure women. They all wear full-length broadcloth coats and a strange conical headpiece, like the caps worn by the imperial guards, and they wrap themselves in white muslin wraps. On their feet they wear soft yellow indoor boots and shoes. They go about very well mannered.


Men’s names.



Women’s names.



Praise of the lovely boys and girls. They have silver limbs and rosy cheeks.



Praise of the salubrious climate. Because of the fine climate, all the people reach the age of seventy or eighty without diminution of their faculties.



Praise of the sparkling Water of Life. On one side is the Drin River, like the Water of Kawthar, and on the other side is Lake Boyana, whose water is like pure wine (76:21).



Climes and latitudes of towns and countries.



The rising star of auspicious prosperity.



Churches of monks.



Cereals and plants.



Manufactured goods.



Meats and foodstuffs.

Natural wonders. The hand of the Almighty Creator fashioned seven grassy islands of various sizes in the middle of the lake, no bigger than one or two or three or five threshing-floors. During some years a violent storm arises and these little islands become dislodged and move to another part of the lake. Sometimes the islands even meet in the middle of the lake and join together. They each have a variety of shrubs and grassy plots. The townsfolk like to sail out to these little islands in their caiques for picnics.

Sometimes a strong wind arises and one or two of the islands get dislodged and float from one end of the lake to the other, taking the people with them as though borne on the throne of King Solomon’s audience-hall. The people delight in sailing about on the islands, and they boast of their exploits in years gone by. No one ever suffers any harm, for that is the nature of these islands – God is capable of everything (2:20). It takes an extremely strong wind to dislodge the islands, or so it is reported. There were quite a few storms during the time that I was in Shkodër, but I never saw those islands moving, though I did see them not moving. In my curiosity I questioned the old people about the past, and they related the following, ‘In the year when Sultan Osman II advanced against Chotin (i.e., 1621) there was a severe winter storm which caused even the Bosphorus in Istanbul to freeze over. Here in Shkodër the storm blew down houses and uprooted large trees, whirling them in the air like falconers’ lures. That year, these little islands in Lake Boyana floated about for forty or fifty days, from north to south and from east to west.’ This is what the old-timers told me.





Praise of the Lake of Albanian Iskenderiye (Lake Shkodër). The body of pure water at the foot of the fortress is known as Lake Boyana. It stretches lengthwise from east to west and is 11 miles in circumference. Mt Tarabosh, which looms up on the other side of the lake, is a cannon’s range distance. It was from there that Mehmed the Conqueror bombarded the fortress. The other banks stretch lengthwise, forming a kind of freshwater strait, with Mt Tarabosh at the mouth of it, where the water runs out of the lake. There is a delightful promenade at that end of the lake. From there a tributary flows westward for four hours until, after passing through vineyards and orchards, it empties into the sea. At the foot of the cliffs on which the fortress is built are ten weirs for catching fish. These are state-owned; the income deriving from the fish caught in the weirs and in the lake is confiscated by the agent on behalf of the garrison of Shkodër fortress and goes to pay the salaries of the preachers and imams of the imperial (i.e., congregational) mosques in the city.

Many kinds of fish are caught in this lake, and in immense quantities. Plaice, carp, sea bass and mullet swim up the tributary from the sea into the lake. Eels are found in quantity and quality that outmatch those in the lakes of Kastoria, Ohrid, and Beşik. They are fat and have a musky scent that is peculiar to the eels of Lake Shkodër and not to be found elsewhere. Also, they are a marvellously beneficial fish. Anyone suffering from fevers and ailments can be cured by cooking and eating these eels, or merely by carrying eel-heads on their persons. Because of the presence of this type of musk-eel, the people of Shkodër suffer from no ills of any kind.

The pure water of this lake, when drunk regularly, brings about a loosening of the bowels and a cure for problems of the spleen and gallbladder, and for phlegm, headaches, constipation, swellings, and similar illnesses.





Professions. There are fishermen, soldiers, merchants who trade on land and sea, handicraftsmen, scholars and ulema, and vintners for the 23,000 vineyards. This place is the home of brave and diligent Albanian gazis, who, like Farhad, earn their living by hard toil. There are no other nationalities in this city.

They all speak Albanian, which is like no other tongue. In origin, the Albanians were one of the Arab tribes of Quraysh in Mecca. That is why there are some Arabic words still in use among them. When these Albanian tribesmen emerged from the mountains of Shkodër and Vlora, they mingled with the Italian Franks, and so, during the Caliphate of Umar, produced a language between Arabic and Frankish. We will give an account of the reason for this and of the origin of the Albanians in another place.





For now – Language of the Albanians – it is called the language of Arnavud or, in Persian, Ar-na-bud (‘May there be no shame’), and certain chroniclers write it this way. It is a delightful language that they speak humbly and gently when addressing one another with respect. The infidels among them pass as Christians, although this, too, is at the insistence of the Spaniards and the Venetians. Otherwise, they are a company of scriptureless infidels and fornicators who, like the Zoroastrians, know nothing of the Book or of Judgement Day. Their language is as follows:

First, pörtuni zoti For God’s sake!

When buying and selling they count coins thus: ñe 1 dü 2 tiri 3 kotrá 4 pensı 5 gaşt 6 iştat 7 tetı 8 nandı 9 dhit 10.

falemi müre Greetings, men aye şendoş enbahi Hey, are you well? mir niştıra nişe Good morning miliserde (Welcome) palá mizuni (Thank you).

buk bread uy water miş meat dele sheep pulı hen.

bayá müre Come, man aha buk Will you eat bread? ku kıye Where have you been? miyalt honey akı te ki Is there barley? nuku kám There isn’t ruş grapes akı mebe teşin kurd Bring barley or I’ll split your head open pörtuni zoti nuku kám akı For God’s sake, there is no barley.

támu mother motrá sister şoke wife.

The following are foolish expressions, but the traveller needs to know them since he might be the object of cursing or a beating: hak mut Eat shit! tıkifşatı támu I’ll fuck your mother tıkifşatı şoke I’ll fuck your wife tı pirişte bıhund I’ll fart in your nose tıkifşatı büthı I’ll fuck your ass iç kıvırdım catamite, pimp.

In short, when dervishes are travelling, they should know such expressions as well, so that they can avoid trouble by not going to places where they will be abused.





Conclusion of the eulogy of Shkodër. In the open town there are two bridges over the Drin River, the Hüseyn Bey Bridge and the Ali Politina Bridge.

Places of pilgrimage. Inside the fortress is the shrine of Muyo Baba, may his mystery be sanctified.





3. The Samakov iron works





Among the noteworthy products (of Samakov) are highly-wrought iron lanterns with cages; tinned iron trays with hinges for serving food – fine objects that can even be taken on campaign; all kinds of locks; horse-baggage clamps; iron wolf- and lion-traps; coffee mills in small iron boxes – they can also be used in a pinch to grind flour; and nails of various types – fireng, lofça, zağra, ortasayış, yüleme, miyane, tahta – that are exported from Samakov to all countries of the world.

There are a total of 110 iron works in the city of Samakov and in the surrounding districts. In this region samakov has become a generic term for ‘iron works’.

The huge fires in the forges are fanned by bellows operated by water mills; even ten men would be unable to operate one of them. The iron anvils are as big as the belly of an elephant. The red-hot iron emerges from the fire, glowing like Yemeni carnelian, and master ironsmiths place it on an anvil. The hammers used to beat it are operated by water wheels, each hammer being the size of a water-buffalo head, causing the ground to quake. Two smiths work at one anvil. They keep the iron, which may weigh one or two quintals, moving back and forth beneath the blows of the hammers until it stretches out into a rod. They stop the hammers by stopping the water wheel.

This operation goes on day and night. It is a kind of ironmongery that even David, son of Solomon, patron saint of ironsmiths, never accomplished. Few travellers have ever seen this and, as the verse has it, How can hearing measure up to seeing? It is hard to imagine unless you have seen it with your own eyes. The same is true for forging cannons in the Istanbul gun foundry; casting cannon-balls in Danzig; forging the iron Tatar kettles in the village of Çüyençi in the Crimea; and forging iron here in Samakov – it is a craft of white demons rather than of human beings. Anyone who sees it is dumbstruck.

Every year 8,000 carts of iron go from this Samakov to the entrepôts of Salonica and Varna, from where it is shipped to all parts of the Ottoman Empire, and the ironsmiths in every city use it to fashion things as they wish.





4. An adventure near Komorn; Tatar raid into Western Europe





Beginning of the adventure of the world-traveller Evliya the unhypocritical


By God’s wisdom, while Uyvar castle was being renovated and repaired, this humble one ran short of fodder for my horses. On an inauspicious day, Gürci Mehmed Pasha and his troops from Aleppo province constituted the vanguard of an Ottoman force going to forage below the walls of Komorn castle. 10,000 men set out from below the walls of Uyvar castle in the direction of Komorn, striking up their military bands. This humble one also, with four of my slaveboys on mounts and two packhorses, joined Gürci Pasha. 20,000 more soldiers joined this advance party from the Wallachian and Moldavian and Tatar troops camped along the way, plus 5,000 mounted servants.

Seeing this rabble army I heartened my slaveboys with such pleasantries as ‘Opportunity is plunder’ and First the companion, then the road. We accompanied all these vermin out of Uyvar and along the Litre River in a southern direction.

After proceeding for four hours, we came to a verdant grove. Gürci Mehmed Pasha suddenly dismounted and gave his banners and military band to his deputy, (—) Agha.

‘You go ahead,’ he said, and stayed in that park.

We continued toward Komorn through the grassy plain, a body of soldiers without a head. In three hours Komorn castle appeared, like a white swan; it is situated on a populated island in the middle of the Danube.

Now Gürci Pasha’s deputy, having ridden up a hill, also dismounted without striking up his military band. The pasha’s men tumbled down all about and, neglecting to set guards, fell asleep and began to snore. The rabble army dispersed in all directions like ants and snakes, ostensibly to forage, but actually to pillage the surrounding villages. Had our commander’s deputy remained an hour behind and protected us, he would have guarded the Ottoman troops.

This humble one too, at this juncture, entered a prosperous village with a few companions and – on the consideration that Property of infidels is permitted for believers – we filled our sacks with oats and wheat and barley, loaded our packhorses with another forty bundles of wheat, grabbed a few geese and chickens and were on our way when my slaveboy named Seyfi spoke up, ‘Agha, over there is a lot of sifted flour, and some white honey in barrels. Let’s take some of that too, bring it to the camp and eat it there.’

He darted through a hedge into a house and began gathering up the honey and butter. Just then gunpowder sparks appeared above Komorn castle.

‘Hurry up, my boy,’ I cried. ‘They’ve made a gunpowder signal from the castle. It isn’t a good sign.’

Suddenly a cry of Allah Allah! rose up from the direction of the Pasha’s deputy and from amidst the troops who had gone foraging. Our party let out a cry of woe. There was a clash of swords and a thundering of muskets among the Ottoman soldiery. Everyone was trying to save his skin.

This humble one was left in the middle between Komorn castle and the place where our commander’s deputy was doing battle. It seems I had gone quite a ways ahead. It was a perilous situation.

‘My boy,’ I cried, ‘I’ve given up the honey and oil. We’re going to give up our lives. Come out of there!’

Now seven banners with crosses and 1,000 infidels appeared from behind the village we were plundering. I cut the ropes of the packhorses with my sword and, leaving the goods behind, joined the animals to my spare horse and was ready to go with my two slaveboys. The infidels were approaching the village, and we were cut off before and behind.

‘Hey Seyfi, my boy! Come out of the house. We’re being attacked by some infidels.’

Seyfi emerged. He had become quite the hero: the two pockets of his shalwars (baggy trousers) were filled with all sorts of items that he had tracked down. As he was scrambling through the hedge the poor lad’s shalwar got caught on a stake. By the time he freed himself and got to his horse, the infidels had surrounded us. Some of them entered the village.

At this point my two mounted slaveboys fled toward our troops, leaving me there alone. I tried to help Seyfi mount, but ten of the infidels saw us and came galloping toward us, shooting bullets and shouting, in Hungarian, ‘Ey beştelelen kurafiya!’

Taking refuge in God, I too shot at them with my hand-musket. One of the infidels fell headlong from his horse. I was just reaching for my quiver when the infidels stopped to look after their dead comrade. I headed toward Seyfi, but noticed that his horse had a bullet wound and was rearing up. The infidels drove the boy ahead of them in my direction.

But now ten brave youths from our soldiery came to my aid. As they were doing battle with the infidels, I brought my packhorse to Seyfi and told him to mount that. The poor lad had go free of the infidels, but was exhausted from running. He grabbed the pommel of the packsaddle and tried to mount, but by bad luck, the packsaddle slipped beneath the horse’s belly and the boy tumbled onto the ground.

Ten or fifteen infidels rushed upon him. Twenty others penned me in on one side and were shooting at me from all directions. God be praised, none of the bullets hit their mark, but my horse had been struck and wounded at the first onslaught and now began to rear up.

I was at my wit’s end. The world darkened and narrowed about my head. By now I realised that the situation was hopeless. The ten youths who had come to my aid had increased to twenty, but all twenty were laid low by the sword. I looked around me and could see neither earth nor sky.

Fearing for my life, I again grabbed my quiver, notched an arrow, crouched on my horse’s neck and galloped forward. As I approached my slaveboy and was about to pass him, the poor lad cried, ‘Agha, don’t leave me among the infidels!’ He heaved such a burning sigh that my heart was cut in two. But what could I do? The infidels had both of us surrounded and were trying to capture me as well.

Noticing a space where there were no infidels I raced like thunder in that direction and made my way toward the Ottoman soldiery, crying, ‘Giddup, my horse Hamis!’ But what a horse! One of Solomon’s prancing steeds (38:31), noble as an Arab thoroughbred, dearer to me than my own brother.

I was out of sight of the infidels. But now I noticed blood gushing from the bullet wound at my horse’s withers down to his shoulder blade. I snatched my handkerchief from my bosom, tore it in two and stuffed the pieces into his wound. Thank God, the blood stopped flowing.

But now a party of fifty infidels appeared on my right side. Driving me forward they came within musket range. A divine inspiration came over me. Gathering my strength, I turned to God with utmost sincerity and began to pray, ‘O Lord, You who are worshipped by all creatures, You are my refuge. On this field of battle and amidst a thousand hardships, convey this lowly slave from the abyss of destruction to the frontier of salvation.’

Meantime I pressed my poor wounded horse to the utmost. God be praised, I came to the field where the Ottoman troops were fighting and soon was in the midst of the fray. The infidels were getting reinforcements on all sides, while our troops were being decimated.

Just then, by God’s wisdom, a troop of Tatars arrived and showered the infidels with a volley of arrows. On our side the Ottomans who were routed wheeled about to attack. In an instant 3,000 infidel souls were consigned to the fires of hell.

In this fashion a heated battle was kept up for one sidereal hour. Thousands of infidel corpses adorned the Uyvar plain like the tree of Waqwaq.49 Praise God the Absolute, in this illustrious gaza thousands of gazis hung their soul-melting swords on the roof of the celestial Throne.

What should we see next? Seventy banners with crosses appeared in the woods and groves from the direction of Komorn castle. Infidel soldiers, drawn up for battle like a herd of swine, came regiment upon regiment, hauling their cannons and sounding their trumpets in the rehavi musical mode.

The infidel Wallachian and Moldavian regiments of our own victory-tokened soldiery, who were assigned to one wing as guard troops and were standing by quietly, took flight as soon as they saw the enemy’s banners with crosses. The tricky infidels, finding an opening, attacked the Tatars, shouting Yajuj Yajuj (Jesus! Jesus!) and shooting a volley of cannons and muskets. The Tatars for their part, unhappy with cannonballs and bullets, took flight toward Esztergom.

Now the infidels became even more daring, regiment upon regiment attacking our muleteers and equerries coming to forage. A huge battle ensued that lasted an entire hour, during which several hundred of our brave gazis quaffed the sherbet of martyrdom from the goblet of this world and their spirits wafted to the gardens of paradise.

Next the infidels galloped toward Gürci Mehmed Pasha’s deputy, hurling cannon- and musket-shot. All the Pasha’s Segban troops – according to the grammatical rule to flee the succession of plurals – abandoned their drums and fifes and banners and fled toward Uyvar.

As for this humble one, I was left behind with a band of poor men who had lost their horses. Taking stock of the situation and overcome with dread, I wondered whether I too would have to drink from the cup of martyrdom in this field of battle; or would I be able to get in safety to Uyvar? Gathering my wits – for I was intoxicated enough without quaffing the cup of martyrdom – I made common cause to flee with those routed soldiers and distraught and grief-ridden individuals. Some had tumbled from their horses and lay sprawling on the ground. It was like the day when the dead will be gathered from their graves.

While contemplating this sad scene, a band of Hungarian cavaliers, some on horse, some on foot, emerged from the forest like pigs from a grove and attacked us with great vigour. Our distraught soldiers were like birds fallen in a trap. For my part, I bowed to destiny, saying ‘It is God’s to command.’ We all fled in different directions.

To my left was a marshy reed bed along a tributary of the Vak River. I galloped over to it and plunged in. I was quite dizzy, and up to my ears in water. My horse beneath me whinnied and started swimming. The infidels behind me showered me with bullets like the rain of damnation. Glory to God the Preserver (Hafız) who preserved this preserver (hafız) of the Koran and did not allow me to suffer any harm.

Eventually my horse’s hooves touched the ground. At that moment my eyes filled with bloody tears, for I realised that I had emerged on the opposite bank of the Vak River, which was infidel territory. Considering this, I prayed as follows, ‘O Lord, strength and power and victory are Yours. Do not let this Koran of Yours, which I bear (in my memory), fall to the infidels as their share. For the sake of Your ancient Speech (i.e. the Koran), do not let me fall captive to the infidels. Deliver me from this whirlpool before the bird of my soul flies from the cage of my body, and let me reach my place of birth safe and sound.’

With such sincere prayers, and seeking intercession from the 124,000 prophets and succour from the spiritual graces of the 77,000 great saints, I wandered aimlessly in a grassy plain. There was no sign of man or jinn. But now and then I could still hear the report of muskets from the battlefield across the river.

As I wondered which way to go, I heard the shot of ten balaramada guns to the north and I took heart, realising that Uyvar lay in that direction. So I proceeded fearlessly toward the sound of those guns. Meanwhile, though my life was in danger, my mind could not let go of fancies and worries regarding my worldly possessions – my heavy baggage on one side; my miserable captive slaves on another; and my four Arab thoroughbreds on another.

Meanwhile my soul’s companion, my zephyr-swift steed Hamis, was going slower and slower, exhausted from his wound. My own heart seemed to be wounded because of his wound. I went on aimless and downcast, recalling the verses:

No sign of the door through which you came,



No sign of the ford you will have to cross.





And:

Where is the place of safety, where, oh where?





For there was no place to turn. On one side was the vast Vak River; on the other side the white castle of the infidels, Komorn. No friend, no grief-dispelling companion, and no road leading anywhere.

I continued on in this state of confusion, murmuring my litanies. Suddenly, on my right side, by God’s wisdom, a white ram appeared in an oak grove. My horse underneath me began to paw the ground and prance about like a piebald or sorrel, rose-bodied Arabian steed. I took comfort at this and looked at the ram. It was fat and plump, with a curly white fleece, lovely black eyes and black horns, a fat tail like a Karaman sheep – congealed light. It did not shy away from me, but rather approached and seemed to rub against my horse, keeping pace with it. Sometimes it bleated with a sad voice – in my whole life I have never heard a sheep bleat in this fashion.

Watching this spectacle I forgot all the pains we had suffered. It was as though I had found eternal life. My horse underneath me likewise kept up its strutting and prancing. Sometimes the ram ran in front of the horse, looked back to us with a kindly expression and bleated. I wondered at this mystery and concluded that it was the Men of the Unseen World who had taken this shape and were guiding us. We both – my horse and I – found great comfort in this, and I decided to follow the ram wherever it led.

We went and went until we came to the shore of the great Vak River. On the other side I could see rose gardens and date groves and vegetable gardens. The ram plunged into the water and headed across, now swimming, now walking with its feet touching the river bed. It stepped onto an island, turned toward me and began to bleat louder and oftener. It went into and out of the water, bleating the while, as if to say: ‘You too come this way, cross to where there is safety.’

Now I was unable to restrain my horse underneath me. With a leap my horse Hamis plunged into the water, which soon came up to the saddle. But after going twenty paces it only came up to the stirrups. We reached the island. Both the ram and my horse underneath me frisked and frolicked. I could hardly keep from falling off the saddle. ‘This is my Lord’s favour’ (27:40), I cried, weeping with joy.

Once again the ram plunged into the river and crossed to the other side. This time its feet never touched the ground, but it swam all the way in a zigzag course. With my sword I cut an oak branch and trimmed it like a spear. Holding it in my hand, and uttering a besmele, I spurred my horse into the river. It was rather deep, but using the branch to sound the depth, with God’s help I crossed safely. Once again ram and horse pranced and danced like Venus.

Then the white ram began to run in the direction of Uyvar. It bleated back to us and we joined it. It kept on bleating toward Uyvar, then plunged into the river and disappeared. A little later I saw it on the other side.

God be praised, I crossed that raging Vak River in safety with the help of God and, no doubt, the men of the unseen world. I realised that the prophet Hızır had taken that shape and guided us. By the grace of God, and with the blessings of the prophets and the saints whose shrines I had visited in the seven climes over forty years of travel, I had escaped from this whirlpool.

With countless praises to God for this salvation, I proceeded in the direction of Uyvar. It seems that some of our men who had been routed in the battle had strayed into these forests.

‘Comrade,’ they said when they saw me, ‘are there any infidels ahead of you or behind you?’

‘No, there’s nothing,’ I replied.

Now all the wounded men who were hiding in the forest came out into the open. Most were horseless and helpless. They tried to approach me, but I kept them at bay. How often it has happened that someone who appeared to be ill or wounded would knock a man from his horse, mount it himself and flee! As the proverb has it: ‘The horse belongs to him who mounts it, the sword to him who girds it on.’ So I put off the wounded men, consoling them with words of encouragement, or exchanging banter with them about our escapades.

As I went ahead, looking back and forth, a party of our Tatar friends came riding up, 2,000 swashbuckling Tatars with their spare mounts. True, they are ruthless soldiers; but – God forgive them! – at my bidding they let those wounded Ottoman soldiers mount and ride alongside them on their spares. So now over 600 wounded and exhausted men rode along with us in comfort.

We went on for another two hours. Here and there we saw our martyred troops, their heads cut off and the nubs of their penises slashed. More wounded troops came and were mounted on the Tatars’ spare horses.

We met another party of 10,000 men going to reinforce our troops who had recently been routed. They inquired about the battle and we told them in detail what had taken place. May God be pleased with them and with their commander Sührab Mehmed Pasha. Even in the midst of battle they gathered the corpses of all the martyrs on this plain, performed the prayer for the dead, and buried them in two large ditches that they dug out.

God be praised, we entered the grand vizier’s camp safe and sound. I directed a thousand prayers of thanksgiving to God. When our benefactors in the Ottoman camp heard about our sad plight, they showered this humble one with presents, including five thoroughbred horses and three Hungarian captives. Three days later, by God’s wisdom, two of my slaveboys who had fled during the earlier battle were delivered to us, along with their horses and equipment, by the routed deputy of Gürci Mehmed Pasha. God be praised, I felt that I had acquired my possessions anew.





Stages of the journey from Uyvar castle with 40,000 enemy-shattering, wind-scattering Tatars to Germany and the Atlantic coast and Holland and Sweden


First, my lord Ahmed Giray Sultan, son of Mehmed Giray Khan, at the order of the grand vizier, made his coastal officer (—) Agha commander over 40,000 Tatars who stood ready with their 200,000 mounts and spares. This humble one, being restless, got leave from Ibrahim Kethüda and Defterdar Ahmed Pasha to join them. Having lightened my load in true Tatar fashion, with only my three slaveboys and six horses, I set forth with a besmele and the intention of performing gaza.

From Uyvar, heading west, we passed Nitre castle, then crossed the Vak River dismounted. That day after a forced march we stopped at the source of the Vak. This river rises in the White Summer Pastures (Ak yaylalar) in the vicinity of the Castles of the Mines (Ma‘den kal‘aları), passes before Uyvar, and joins the Danube in front of Komorn castle.

In the morning we crossed the Summer Pastures of the Mines (Ma‘den yaylaları) and pressed on at a rapid pace for a full day and night. We found no thriving villages, only country that had been burned and devastated by Kurd Pasha and Hacıkey Pashazade. We made a halt that night in a grassy meadow and, having buckled and bitted and bridled our horses and girded our bow-and-arrow cases, we remounted our geldings at the break of dawn and galloped northward.

On the second night we arrived in Tot, a very flourishing country, incomparable in Christendom for productive land and cheap prices. Indeed, the astronomers have likened this prosperous territory to a peacock’s tail, so rich and beautiful is its soil.

It is bounded by Middle Hungary (Orta Macar) in the south; Poland in the east – the Tot language is like Polish; the Czech lands in the north; and Germany in the west. But the Tot people are under an independent Ban who has 200,000 soldiers. But since they are subject to Middle Hungary they are Christian and, like the Hungarians, of the Lutheran sect – cross-worshippers, not idol-worshippers (i.e., Protestants, not Catholics).

So many thousands of Tatars entered this flourishing country, laid waste their villages and towns and thriving cities, burned their houses and took 18,000 infidels captive. They sent all the captives along with the booty back to the Ottoman camp. So the Tatars were left unencumbered and could conduct raids for another day and night.

Next we came to the country of Holland. North of this, on the Baltic coast, is the port of Danzig which is governed by the king of Poland – I had already gone once to Danzig in the year (—) during the time of Islam Giray Khan. Bordering the capital city of Holland on the west is the Czech kingdom; toward the southwest is the kingdom of Sweden; in the south, where the German River (i.e. Rhine?) flows into the Atlantic,50 is Amsterdam, seat of the king of the Flemings. This too was a great and flourishing city, whose infidels were happy, villages fine, and soil productive.

At dawn our Tatars set fire to this city of Holland and took all the naked infidels captive. The booty was too great to carry, so millions worth of goods and furnishings went up in flames. Countless infidels fled to the fortresses, which in this country are quite strong and defensible, since the Tatars have no means to lay siege. Still, 10,000 infidels fell captive in this raid. God be praised, my share of the booty was one girl, one boy and seven horses.

This country is in the seventh clime. We headed north and, doing no harm to Poland with which the Tatars have a treaty, pressed on over the plains for three days and nights to the country of Korol. Its ruler is Varşalka Ban, a notorious and ruthless infidel. I had already come here once in the year (—) during the time of Bahadır Giray Khan – at that time this King Varşalka was just a lad, and his father Yoranda was king.



This flourishing country is bordered on the north by the Baltic coast; Poland is in the east; the Czech country in the west. Korol has always been subject to Poland; but this year it was at odds with Poland and, on the principle that The odds can never be even (lit., Opposites never join), the Polish king laid it waste and took booty without limit and captives without number.

This country is as rich as the meat of a walnut. The Ottomans have never set foot on its territory, but the Tatars have trampled it numerous times. The people here also know Polish and Russian.

So 40,000 Tatars, give or take a few, went burning and pillaging with impunity throughout Korol country – north, south, east, and west – taking captive whomever they did not put to the sword. After three days they reached the Baltic coast where they again laid waste to several cities and took countless Korolian youths captive.

That day we headed west and came below the walled city of Şivekoron, a castle like the Wall of Iskandar, its towers reaching to the sky. In the harbour were seven India ships and several Dutch and English and Portugese vessels. Forty or fifty balaramada guns were shot from the battlements at our soldiers, and the suburb below the walled town was also highly fortified, so we were unable to pillage here at all.

Turning to our right, which is east, we continued with guides all night by moonlight until, at the time of the morning prayer, we came to Heyvaroş. It is in a great plain, a large city without surrounding walls but nevertheless a strong fort surrounded by a deep moat. It has 20,000 houses like the garden of Iram.

As soon as the Tatars arrived they positioned themselves upwind. 40,000 Tatars fitted their bowstrings with two tabur arrows each, and to each arrow tied a match stick. Then they rained these fiery arrows into the city like rain from hell. The wooden houses began to crackle and burn in the flames fanned by the wind. As the infidels were scurrying amidst this woeful conflagration, the Tatars seized the opportunity, found a path through the palisades, poured into the city, took 20,000 captives and much booty, and put all the strapping Cossack warriors to the sword.

We stayed in this city of Heyvar for two days and two nights, camping in our Tatar tents without fear of reprisal. God be praised, here too I got three Korolian boys bright as coral, one exceptional virgin maid, and several vessels of silver and gold. The Tatars also ransacked the basements and found myriads of precious items. If I were to enumerate all of the booty taken in these cities, and if I were to record all of these sojourns in detail, God knows it would require a separate volume.

From there we headed west, galloping for three days and three nights, taking captive anyone we ran into on the way, but passing by villages and towns without burning them. On the fourth day we arrived in the country of the Christian Czechs with flourishing estates. It is bordered by Poland and Korol country to the east, Holland to the south, Germany to the southwest, Sweden to the west, and the Atlantic Ocean (or Baltic Sea) to the north. The cosmographers place this country too in the middle of the seventh clime. Being a coastal region, the climate is mild, growing sugar cane, lemons and citrons, pomegranates, olives, figs and cotton.

It is an independent kingdom. The ruler was formerly one of the Seven Kings (or Seven Princes, i.e. Kurfürsten or Electors) of the German emperor, but since the time of Sultan Süleyman has been subject to the king of Sweden. The people here too are Christian, but Protestant (Luturyan) rather than Catholic (Papişte) – i.e. cross-worshippers rather than idol-worshippers. Their king is a splendid youth named Joachim, his mother being the daughter of the Swedish king. He mints his own coins, a round gold piece and also a pure silver guruş piece called Thaler.

Paying no heed to the seventy-six castles with their suburbs in this country as well, we pressed on toward the north in a forced march and, praise God, reached the Magellan Sea which is a tributary of the Atlantic. The infidels along the way who saw us did not flee but smiled, and we took them all captive. Apparently the people of this region during their long lives had never seen Tatars, though they had heard of them, and had not seen enemy soldiers before at any time in their history.

In this region we got splendid stuffs and rare textiles and countless lovely boys and girls. Praise be to God, this humble one too got as my share three slaveboys and three virgin maids, six wind-swift steeds, several gold-embroidered women’s dresses and vests and silver crosses.

From there, again using our captives as guides, we undertook great raiding expeditions to the west for two days, stopping at night. Weary of this, on the third day we came to the beadless and meadless country of Sweden. This too is a huge fertile territory and an independent kingdom, with seventeen subordinate Bans and seventeen Herzogs, and, as subjects, 800,000 nomadic Tatars. But the latter are Zoroastrian infidels. Several hundred of them fell captive to our Tatars; but they spoke Italian and did not know the Tatar language.

As for the Swedes, they too are Christians of the Lutheran sect. The king is independent and mints his own coins. Ever since the time of Sultan Süleyman they have been bitter enemies of the Germans and have taken seventy-six German castles. They are brave warriors, but no horsemen. All these infidels wear black vests and black Eflatuniye hats, just like the Franks.

Having set foot in this country of Iram we conducted a raiding expedition to the west for one whole day until we arrived at the great city and inauspicious castle of Kallevine. It is an entrepôt on the shore of the River Vistula (? – Vo) and very crowded. It is located at the bottom of the earth (i.e. the northernmost part), the extreme of the seventh clime. The longest summer day, as well as the longest winter night, is 18½ hours and one degree and two minutes. The latitude is (—).

The Vo River has its source in the mountains of Danzig and waters the regions of Sweden and the Seven Kings before it empties in the Atlantic – or so they say, for I have not seen the mouth of the river. But as it flows at the foot of this city it is bigger than the Danube and somewhat smaller than the Volga and the Ural. I judge the Danube to be smaller because in this river of Vo were India ships and galleons of Dunkerque and Denmark.

South of this great city lies an endless plain with village upon village, very thriving and prosperous, where there are everywhere estates with two mansions each and orchards and gardens.

We were unable to tour this city as we wished, since we were too busy raiding and plundering. But it is a merciless castle which shot perhaps 1,000 cannons at the Tatar soldiery. God be praised, no one was hurt.





Remarkable creatures and plants in this region


One is the India hen that comes from India. Also the Egyptian hen. And there is another hen that comes from the New World, with a flat head and flat nose and eyes at the top of its head, a marvellous and ridiculous creature. Its feathers are curled like the fleece of a sheep. Its wings are like those of a chicken, but it has long legs for wading in the water. Sometimes it dives into the water and re-emerges; but since its feet have claws like a hen, it cannot swim.

There are also abundant ducks and geese. All these birds lay two eggs each day. The egg laid in the morning is white, hard and big; the egg laid in the evening is small and soft and, when cooked and eaten, smells like musk.

While this city is at the extreme of the seventh clime, nevertheless, due to its mild coastal climate, it abounds in lemons, oranges, olives, pomegranates and figs. There are no date palms or sycamores or banana trees; but cypresses and pine trees are everywhere.

By God’s command the flowers in this region are very different from those in Turkey, and have different smells.

This city has myriads of marvels and wonders and noteworthy spectacles; but since I was with the restless Tatars, and had no safe-conduct, I was only able to find out this much about the country.

After that we set fire to the surrounding villages and took captive the infidels fleeing to the mountains, amounting to 7,000 choice Frankish lads and lasses. But I got none of this booty, and consoled myself with the verse:

However much you strive to gain your desire,



No more will come to you than your fated share.





Heading south from this city of Kallevine we passed by 800 villages, burning none of them. We just galloped for three days with our captives and booty in tow until we reached the country of the city of Holland. It is governed by (—) (—). This too is a huge fertile territory. Our Kallevine captives told us that this country has a total of 700 castles. The city of Holland was so crowded that we decided not to harm it. We did spend one day and one night on a raiding expedition of the surrounding villages. Since no stranger or enemy had ever set foot in this region before, all the infidels stayed in their houses. Their villages are called Pranda (?).

We took so many splendid captives from this country and so much loot that only God could reckon it. My share consisted of seven girls and three boys. Their males are ugly, but their females have doe eyes, radiant faces and sweet speech. Most of the populace are Czechs, with here and there some Poles, and the peasants are all people of Tot. They are sometimes subject to the Czechs and sometimes to the Swedes. In short, when the Czech king conquers them they are Czechs, when the Swedish king conquers them they are Swedes.





Our return journey in safety from the above-mentioned country of Holland


First we all assembled for keñeş which is to say, consultation, in the language of the Tatars. Of the seventy or eighty thousand captives, we released ten who promised to take us in safety via a different road and through a country even more abounding in booty. We handed them over to the foraging officers to serve as guides, and set out in a southwesterly direction from this country of Holland. Travelling for three days, we took 6,000 more captives en route, burning no villages and destroying no houses.

We came to the great city of Kariş in the country of the Frankish Flemings. It is located in a vast plain on the shore of the German Sea and is adorned with orchards and gardens. Our eyes were dazzled by the gilded crosses in the churches. This large town is at the extreme of the sixth clime. It is governed by the Flemish king, an independent ruler who mints his own pennies and Groschen and round and fragrant florins. He has 3,000 galleons and bargias and carracks, as well as merchant vessels that operate in India and China and the New World.

The Flemings also pass as Christians, but are actually fire-worshipping Zoroastrians like the English infidels, although their scripture is the Gospel. Their Lenten fast for the Red Egg (Easter) festival is like that of the Germans, viz. they eat no oily foods but only fish eggs. Unlike the Germans, the Flemings and the Swedes eat hens’ eggs and sheeps’ liver. So their sect is contrary; and while their scripture is the Gospel, it has been translated into Flemish.

The Flemish language is as follows:

[2.5 lines empty]

They have all sorts of expressions, but what we have recorded is what we heard from our captives.

We remained for one day in the plain and the infidels did not stir. The city is without surrounding walls, a great unwalled habitat spread out over a vast fertile plain. But it is surrounded by a deep moat and has a fort with a single-layered hedge wall.

It happened that five or ten of Mehmed Agha’s men – he is one of our Tatars – captured six infidels and brought them to the camp. One of the prisoners was put to death and the others served as informants. They said, ‘There is a ruined area of the wall on the sea side. If you enter the city from there you will conquer it.’

All the Tatars immediately mounted, tied a burning match stick to each of their arrows, and attacked the fort with a rain of arrows, setting it aflame. The infidels inside the fort started to flee to the mountains southwest of the city, but the Tatars caught up with them and, with a shower of arrows, killed several thousand and took up to 10,000 captive. Others of the gazis entered the city from the places indicated by our infidel guide and pillaged to their hearts’ content.

However, the number of captives we took from this city was small in relation to its size. The reason is that the inhabitants heard that we had gone as far as the Atlantic coast burning so many cities and villages, and so they fled, some by boat, some by horse to the mountains. But although we got few captives, we got much booty. Our Tatars were aware that there were many (potential) captives in the mountain forts and redoubts; but since the mountains were steep and thickly wooded, the Tatars did not enter them for fear of being shot at and because they would have to dismount. So they settled with few captives.

We remained for one day in the plain outside this city, grazing our horses and picking up booty with impunity. The flourishing villages at the foot of the snowy summer pastures to the east of this city provided booty consisting of 10,000 Flemish horses, which suited our Tatars very well, for we had many captives and the captives had no mounts.





Natural wonders of the country of the Flemings


The fields of these villages on the skirt of the snowy summer pastures become cracked from the heat of summer. The bees make hives in the cracks and these produce a fragrant honey like musk and ambergris, which the infidels consume. But many of the hives are deep in the cracks and inaccessible except to foxes, jackals and bears. Of the honey combs that remain in the ground, the honey gets washed away by the winter rains, leaving the beeswax behind. The following spring, by God’s wisdom, the wax begins to seep out of the ground like sprouting grass. If the honeycombs left in the ground were yellow, the wax comes out yellow as saffron; if red, red; if white, white; if green, then green as grass. Thus, by God’s command, waxes of various colours grow out of the ground and perfume the air. When the beeswax reaches its full height of three spans it begins to melt in the heat of the sun. The infidels of that region know its season. They go out to the mountains and orchards and fields with their wives and children to gather the wax. From it they make candles of various colours. They also make dolls out of their white camphor which they sell, and all sorts of idols which they worship.

Again, in the mountains of this city of Kariş in the land of the Flemish Franks, there is a yellow tree like boxwood, tall and decanter-shaped like the cypress in Turkey. People put the leaves, that have a musky scent, in their cupboards, which leaves their homes and their clothing smelling like musk and ambergris. The leaves never fall from the tree, it being an evergreen. At the right season the people gather the leaves and extract a juice from them, like rose-water, which they export throughout Christendom.

The branches and leaves of this tree resemble those of the cypress, except that they are yellow as amber and shiny as gold. The tree bears a fruit, with a pod like a bean, but inedible. From it they extract an oil that they rub on the skin as a curative for scabies and leprosy; it even cures syphilis when applied to the affected limb. The fruit smells like the laurel in Turkey. When they have extracted the oil, they use the pod for incense in their houses and churches. The wood of this tree is used to make cupboards, chairs and tables.

By God’s wisdom, what they call ‘French itch’ (i.e. syphilis) is endemic in this land of the Flemings. To be sure, all Franks have the itch. But God has created this filva (or nilva?) tree as a cure for these ills of theirs. They rub the oil from its fruit on their skin, and anoint their faces and eyes with the juice from its leaves. This humble one too, counting it as a blessing, took some leaves and put them in my clothing.

Departing this city with so much booty and countless captives we pressed on toward the southwest for two days at a forced march, taking captives but burning none of the thousands of villages along the way, until we arrived at Amsterdam, capital of the king of the Flemings. It is a huge walled city, more populous and prosperous than any in the Christian country of the Seven Kings.

We set up camp in a plain to the east of this city, beyond gun-range, and observed it from a distance. We could make out the towers of the 170 great churches rising to the sky, topped by golden crosses the size of a man that flashed in the sun, the roofs covered with fine indigo-coloured lead. Such a built-up city reminded me of Danzig. We could also make out the king’s palace, very beautiful, dazzling our eyes with its rooftops and cupolas and balconies.

Unfortunately we could not enter the city and tour it properly, nor could we get closer to it than we were, since it was so bustling with people and bristling with 200,000 fire-spouting infidel Fleming musketeers. Also, the surrounding walls, with its towers and redoubts, is like the Wall of Iskandar or, to vary the image, like Mt Alburz. Not only could we not approach this paradise-like city, we could not even get beyond the (surrounding) orchards and gardens and approach the moat.

So we kept our distance, only raiding areas within one day’s distance and taking innumerable captives. Those who escaped our swords crowded onto caiques, in fear of the army of Islam (i.e. the Tatars), and remained offshore in the German sea. Most of the boats capsized. One notable captain could not reach his ship and was taken captive with his 300 men. We stayed in camp away from the walled city, setting up watch-posts on all four sides.





Natural wonders


An unusual kind of cabbage grows in some of the garden plots in the countryside surrounding this city. Its leaves are in layers, like a cabbage, and very green, but tart like sorrel. At the very centre of these leaves, where the heart of the cabbage would be, is a white gourd, about the size of a man’s head. This gourd has no seeds but is filled to the brim with millet, like the inside of a fig, and with yellow honey that also tastes like a fig, but sweeter.

I was brought some of these cabbages when they were ripe. The gourds split open like figs and the honey and millet spilled out. In some cases they split in two and, when the honey and millet flowed out, the skin was left behind.

The Frankish physicians ascribe seventy beneficial properties to this fruit. First the outer green leaves, when roasted and eaten, make the complexion ruddy, remove wind from the belly, and sharpen the eyesight. The inner gourd is wholesome and fattening. When it is very ripe, the honey is made into a sherbet that rejuvenates the liver. If the sherbet stands still for three days, it turns into mead, intoxicating without causing hangover, and bracing to the body’s faculties.

This plant is only found in the country of the Flemings. But in origin it is a New World vegetable. Just 200 miles to the west of this country in the Atlantic is England, an island 8,000 miles in circumference; further west, beyond the Atlantic, is the Magellan Sea; and 4,000 miles beyond that is the New World, discovered in the year of the chronogram Fütihata (‘Both are conquered’). The New World ports in this Old World are Western France (Dış Fransa), Sweden, Dunkirk, Denmark, Lonçat (Rotterdam?), and Amsterdam of the Flemings. The above-mentioned cabbage was brought to these ports from the New World and now grows in the Flemish country. Its name is hunza.

I brought a sample of this cabbage to the camp, and even brought it as far as Uyvar where I cooked it with rice and saffron. All who ate it were amazed and said it tasted heavenly.

On the third day we departed this plain of Amsterdam and again headed southwest. After burning villages and gathering captives and booty for two days we arrived on the third day in the country of Prandaporosk (Brandenburg?). This is a vast city with orchards and gardens, spread over a territory like snowy mountains, and governed by the German Kaiser or emperor. Huge numbers of infidels drew up their wagons in a defensive circle and prepared for battle, so we camped a good distance away. We made sure our captives were tightly bound, placed watch-posts all around, tethered the horses with ropes and let them roll in the dust, then saddled them and prepared for battle ourselves.

This city of Prandaporosk is situated at the foot of a great snow-covered summer-pasture and thickly-wooded mountain range. Its infidels had all gone up into the steep mountains a few days before our arrival, while its soldiers had emerged from the walled city and prepared for battle in their Wagenburgs. For this reason we were unable to get any loot here, not even a needle.

The surrounding villages are as flourishing as the garden of Iram. Since it is summer-pasture country, the grapes in its orchards are sweet, and the wine is drunk neat, but the infidels are all drunken on their feet. Orchards and gardens and fields are very fertile and productive. Rivers flow freely and blessings abound.

We could make out a very strong fortress in the middle of the city.

The people of this region are sophisticated and refined. I deduced this from the fact that the bedding and pillows of the peasants in the villages that we plundered were all stuffed with feathers, while the bedsteads were made of balsa wood and holly oak.

As for the climate, the winter is very severe; it rains for six months straight, and the whole country turns into a muddy swamp.

The fortresses here are for the most part like that of Kanizsa, wooden palisades in the midst of reed beds and swamps. Still, each one is a Wall of Iskandar. The infidels of this region make their fortresses very strong out of fear of the Swedish king.

And most of the cannons are wooden as well, made of ash or elm or sarma (?) and shaped like barrels with iron hoops in five or ten places. It takes ten men to lift one cannon. They put ten wooden cannons on a cart, take them where they want them, then affix the iron hoops and begin shooting. They can only be fired fifteen or twenty times, however; sometimes they burst after being fired three or four times.

After getting a bit of booty from the countryside we departed this city of Prandaporosk and again headed southwest, arriving in one day at the border of Germany. The country is mainly forest, and subject to the German Kaiser. Being in possession of Alexander’s crown, which is called Corona, he takes precedence over the Seven Kings and holds sway over 760 castles.

The people are Christians and their scripture is the Gospel, but they have translated that into German; they also recite the Psalms. Their sect is Catholic (Papişte), meaning that of the pope. They all wear black vests and Eflatuniye hats. The hats, however, are not black as with the other Franks, but yellow, blue, green or red, with crane and ostrich feathers stuck in.

After setting foot on this pure and fragrant territory we spent one complete day at a forced march raiding German villages and towns until we came to the great city of Isinriye, capital of the German Kaiser. It is one of the most prosperous and beautiful cities that we observed during this happy campaign, with layer upon layer of buildings. When viewed from one stage distant, the golden crosses atop the indigo-coloured cupolas and on the bell-towers of all the churches glitter in the sunlight. As the city is situated at the skirt of a lofty mountain, we could also make out the streams flowing through it like Salsabil in paradise.

In the endless plain that is eastward of the city, the sweet fragrance of the plants and flowers in the orchards and gardens perfumed the brains of our Tatars. There are parks and picnic spots in all the grassy meadows surrounding the city, with tall shady trees and pavilions and pleasure-domes and benches, and wondrous sights, gardens of rose and hyacinth and sweet basil like the garden of Iram. But they were empty of people, since all the infidels had fled within the city walls out of fear of our Tatar soldiery.

While we were considering with the Tatars whether to set fire to the surrounding villages and towns, a contingent of 300 infidels appeared from the direction of the city of Isinriye with a white flag. Three of the infidels rode up crying ‘Mercy, O Chingissid soldiers, mercy!’ They brought a letter, written in Turkish, the gist of which was as follows, ‘Welcome to you. Thus far you have not burned our villages and our thriving orchards and pavilions. May Jesus and Mary be pleased with you. In exchange for this kindness we have sent you and your soldiers two carts with 20,000 Groschen and fifty carts of grain. Please accept these and depart without destroying our prosperous and beautiful city that is the envy of kings.’

When the letter was read the gifts of money and grain were accepted and distributed among the gazis. My share consisted of 100 Thalers.

We learned that the governor of the city was a certain Joachim, a kinsman of the German Kaiser, who by this stratagem got the Tatars to leave and saved the city. Our commander, the coastal officer (—) Agha, took the gifts as hush-money and said: ‘Henceforth it makes no sense to destroy the country of Germany.’

So we proceeded along the Danube, keeping the walled towns of German Hungary (Alaman Ungurus) on our right side and refraining from pillaging them, since they belonged to the German Kaiser and we had accepted the gifts of his magistrate Joachim. These included the castles of Serinbe, Tancavar, Anpirvar, şinvardo, Prague – one of the Kaiser’s capital cities; (—) (—) (—); Vienna – another of his capitals; Peşpehel Porok, Frau, Ovar, Kastel, Senmartin, Porok, Pojon, Yanık; Tata, Papa, Pirespirim – these last three are in the mountains; and Komorn.





Stages of our journey from the lands of Germany to the country of Middle Hungary


Departing from below İsinriye we trotted eastward for three entire days, covering in that time a distance of seventy-six hours, until we set foot on the border of Middle Hungary at the castle of Holçar. It is situated in the midst of a vast plain, so we were able to take it by surprise attack and set fire to its large suburb. The booty we got there was beyond reckoning, including 2,000 choice captives, 150 cartloads of goods, various silver and gold vessels, precious stuffs and rare commodities.

Also, since this is the cavalry country of the Hungarian infidels, we took 7,000 horses of the Hungarian cavaliers. God be praised, this lowly one got as my share seven horses, six infidels, one slaveboy and two virgin maids.

So the large suburb was burnt; but the walled city was intact, and there was nowhere for the Tatars to find refuge. Now the damned infidels inside the castle fired several hundred of their cannons from a single wick and, in a trice, 200 of our Tatar gazis were martyred and 600 wounded. During the entire time of this happy campaign, and throughout the four kingdoms that we covered, no one’s nose had been bloodied, and only twenty of our brave soldiers had been killed; but now so many doughty champions quaffed the cup of martyrdom below this castle of Holçar. Thank God we did not leave any of the noble bodies of these gazis in the field, but loaded them all on horseback and buried them in the mountains, setting fires over the burial ground in order that their graves not be known. May God have mercy upon them.

While our gazis were plundering and destroying the villages in this plain of Holçar castle, a very large troop of infidels appeared on our western side. This rather disconcerted us, and as we prepared for battle we decided that if the troop proved large and hostile we would first of all massacre our captives. But then it appeared from their flags and banners that they were Polish soldiers. I took a look through my spyglass and confirmed that the troop belonged to the king of Cracow who was subject to the king of Poland.

They sent a contingent to our side under a white flag, and we did the same to theirs. It seems that the Polish king had a customs agent living in Holçar castle. The Polish soldiers paid no attention to us but went straight into the castle and, almost immediately, sent fifty cartloads of grain to our soldiers. They were able to do this because at that time the Poles and the Tatars were allies. The coastal officer distributed the grain among the Tatars.

Then the Polish captain, with 300 infidels, brought fifty purses of Groschen in two hınto coaches and ransomed the 2,000 captives whom the Tatars had taken in the Holçar suburb. At first I was reluctant to part with my seven infidel captives, but eventually gave them up for two purses of Groschen. When it turned out that one of them was a town official, I regretted having given him up so cheaply, but it was too late to do anything about it.

The Poles took the 2,000 captives and went with them into Holçar castle. So many cannons were fired in celebration that earth and sky shook. We learned later that this castle or Middle Hungary was right on the border with Poland.

From there we headed southwest

[11 lines empty]

In seven places in four lofty mountains there are silver mines (with veins) as thick as an arm. But they are all underground, and since there is no one there, the workshops stand idle. Although this territory belongs to Middle Hungary, the German Kaiser has seized these mines and derives income from them to the tune of 10,000 purses. It is a wonderful sight.

From there we went seven hours, by-passing several prosperous Hungarian villages that had been burnt, and came to Derinma‘den (‘Deep Mine’). The Uyvar gazis had pillaged the extramural settlement and villages here as well, but had not set fire to them. So we raided the suburb at the break of dawn, lit all four sides with Tatar fire, and disturbed the sleep of all the infidels. We took 1,500 captives, shackling their legs and shattering their hearts, and lopped off the hapless cabbage-head of their trollopy metropolitan, commending his wicked soul to the fires of hell.

[3.5 lines empty]

We passed the walled town of Litre and, with a forced march for one day, passed the profitless places that had been burnt. In (—) days, on the (—) day of the month of (—), returned to Uyvar. We paraded before the grand vizier’s tent-pavilion below the walled town, displaying all our captives numbering (—), 2,060 carts loaded with precious stuffs and goods, and horses taken from 26,000 infidels.

The grand vizier presented robes of honour to the coastal officer and to 105 Tatars and the foraging officers; but not even a snakeskin to this humble one. I frowned and pouted and looked down in the dumps. As I was leaving, the grand vizier said, ‘Hey, isn’t that Evliya?’

‘Yes my lord, it is he,’ came the reply.

‘Did he go on this campaign too? He has turned into a Tatar! Well, he is the Mother of Narratives. Let’s inquire wisdom of Loqman. Call him here!’

He clothed me in a gold-embroidered robe of honour, gave me 50 gold pieces, and stuck a crest in my turban. I in turn kissed his noble hand and showered him with benedictions, for he had honoured me among my peers.

‘Go for now,’ he said, ‘you are tired. Come back this evening and give us an account of these glorious gazas.’

‘Certainly, my lord,’ said I, and went off to my tent.

As we were leaving, the presents from the coastal officer to the grand vizier arrived and were handed over to the treasurer, including 300 excellent slaveboys and girls and 300 hınto coaches with crystal-glass windowpanes loaded with precious items.

God be praised, this lowly and weakly one went on this gaza and returned without uttering a sigh, and without my servants grumbling even once. Thanks be to God, I came unscathed to my tent and was reunited with the rest of my servants, bringing with me a total of (—) lovely slaveboys and (—) girls like unpierced pearls and unopened buds, and (—) splendid cavalier’s horses, and one hınto coach and plenty of stuffs. Praise be the Lord Creator who recompensed me a thousand times in this gaza for my horses and my captive Seyfi, taken from me earlier in the battle below Komorn castle, and for all the pains and hardships I suffered on that day. This is of my Lord’s favour (27:40).

The next morning I presented one lovely slaveboy to my lord, the grand vizier’s deputy, and one lovely slavegirl to my lord Defterdar Ahmed Pasha. In order to lighten my load, I kept only three of the captives and sold the rest along with the horses and the items of booty, and rested content.

49 ‘A legendary element which Islamic geography shares with the Thousand and One Nights are the Waqwaq Islands, located somewhere in the southeast of the world … on those islands a tree produces fruit in the shape of human (female) bodies. The only sound they give is the waq waq which has given them the name. It is said that sailors who land there sometimes pluck them, and even have intercourse with them, although, once severed from the tree they decay within a couple of days. This colourful legend was seriously discussed by a man as rationalistic and critical as the seventeenth century polymath Katib Celebi. Its popularity is attested by the fact that the janissary uprising of 1656, during which the corpses of dignitaries killed by the insurgents were hanged from a plane tree in Istanbul’s central square, the Hippodrome, was remembered as the Waqwaq incident.’ (Gottfried Hagen in Dankoff 2006, 222–3)

5. Dubrovnik (Ragusa)





Stage of the Han of the Nazarete of Bandışka


Here in Christendom, Nazarete (lazaretto) is the term for the han or guesthouse where merchants and diplomats – whether from India or Yemen or Samarkand, Arabia or Persia, or from the Ottoman sultan or the vizier of Bosnia or the Pasha of Herzegovina – are lodged. Generally they must stay for forty days, in special circumstances for ten or seven or, at the very least, three days, to make sure they are not plague-ridden before they enter the city, and to ascertain other intelligence.

In this lazaretto, a military officer with fifty of his infidel subalterns stand guard over the resident guests. If a merchant has something he wants to bring to the city, but his forty days in the lazaretto are not yet up, they rub some vinegar on one end or one edge of the merchandise and give it to one of the infidels waiting their turn, who takes it to the city and sells it. They vainly suppose that plague will not enter the city with that item as long as it is rubbed with vinegar.

This Han of the Nazarete is located some distance away from the walled town of Dubrovnik, on the western side. It is a square building, very like a han, with numerous and well-outfitted rooms, one after the other, and kitchens and stables and rooms for the infidel soldiery. Those standing guard over the guests shut the gates every night and open them again in the morning.

Outside the lazaretto are some houses belonging to Gypsies and to other poor Lasman infidels, also graveyards with an effigy of Jesus. They say that Simon the Pure (St Peter), who was Jesus’s successor and one of his disciples, is buried here. The lazaretto itself is a large square han built on a rocky site along the seashore.

The infidels, after treating this humble one with due care, on the third day invited us to enter the city in our formation.





Description of the capital of the Latins, the castle of Dubrovnik of the Satans


There are two Venediks on the face of the earth. One is called Bundukani Venedik – this is Venice the rebellious that has been at war with the Ottomans for the past twenty-five years. The other is this one, called Dobra-Venedik (i.e. Dubrovnik), a separate ancient community. To be sure, they are Christians, but they have translated the Gospel into Latin and recite it thus. They go so far as to claim, preposterously, that the Gospel was revealed by God to the prophet Jesus in their own Latin language, and they take pride in this.

Indeed, Latin is the most correct and eloquent of the various languages of Christendom; and, like Persian, it is an ancient and elegant tongue. And the Latin chronicles are the most reliable and authoritative. In fact, when a chronicler writes a history, it is first examined by an ecclesiastical board to make sure that it contains no errors or exaggerations. Only after it has been approved by the board, and the Twelve Bans have given their imprimatur, can it be printed.

The infidels here are very critical and deductive scholars: astrologers, diviners, surgeons, phlebotomists and historians. In fact, by their mastery of astrology they know about the Prophet Muhammad’s being the possessor of this world. They know that the Ottomans have emerged and their state will last forever, that they will not leave a single infidel on the face of this earth, that they will reign until the coming of the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus. In their books of prognostication they find the destiny of every ruler.

In the year (—), when Osman Gazi was besieging Bursa, these Dubrovnik infidels realised that the future world conquerors had emerged. So they sent their ambassadors to Osman Gazi in Bursa with (—) gold pieces and plenty of silk brocades and other precious stuffs. Finding that Osman Gazi had died and that his son Orhan Gazi had conquered Bursa, the Dubrovnikers gave all the presents to Orhan Gazi and made a peace treaty with him, agreeing to send the specified sum of treasure every year with their ambassadors. The treaty contained 150 articles, in return for which they received 150 imperial decrees.

For this reason the infidels of Dubrovnik have accepted peace with the Ottomans to this very day. They are a bunch of foresightful and farsighted infidels who never do anything contrary to the treaty and whose envoys never fail to arrive (in Istanbul) at the beginning of every year, before any others.

But despite the fact that they have renewed their treaty with the Ottomans every year since Orhan Gazi, still they are like the great plague under the wing of the Ottoman state, damnable swine who maintain the pretence of truth but whose satanic machinations infect all the infidels. To be specific: it is these Dubrovnik infidels who have led astray those of the great Bundukani Venedik – the Venetians, who are now our enemy – and secretly supply them with grain. They are the wealthiest of all the infidel kings, but make a show of poverty and humility in order to protect their state, and craftily maintain peaceful relations with all other rulers.

To make a long story short, these infidels treated this humble one also with courtesy and kindness and brought us in our formation to their capital and castle named (—) (—). Both the Pasha of Bosnia and the Pasha of Herzegovina have highly-placed customs officials residing in this castle, and I and my retinue were lodged in a palace near them. A military officer was assigned to keep an eye on us. We were given ample supplies of food and drink, but had to stay where we were: our infidel guards did not permit us to wander about. After the time of the evening prayer they shut the gates upon the customs officials and upon us, and opened them in the morning. Peculiar guards these, God damn them!





Shape and dimensions of the castle of Dubrovnik


It is a mighty fortress and thriving walled city of dressed stone built on a rocky site along the seashore. Its name in Latin is (—) (—). Its founder was (—) (—) Ban of the Latin people, who founded it before Jesus according to the Latin chronicles. They also write that since its founding it has never been taken by the hand of an enemy, nor have its walls ever been breached.

It is fortified on all sides, like the Wall of Iskandar. On the land side, which is the eastern and northern side, is a lofty tower like the Rampart of Gog. The entire gulf is visible from this tower, as though spread out beneath its feet, and big balaramada guns protect both the land walls and the harbour. There are forty-seven such mighty towers outfitted with balaramada guns.

This castle is two miles in circumference, although I was unable to pace it out. The fortification on the land side consists of two layers of walls and one layer of moat carved out of the cliff. The surrounding walls are very fine and firm. On the land side, however, there are five hills that loom above it; at these five points there are two walls, each twenty cubits thick, and a three-layered redoubt, also the moat doubles back on itself. The sea wall, on the other hand, is a single layer.

There are a total of (—) gates. It is a mighty city51 situated at the mouth of a small gulf inside the great Venetian Gulf (Adriatic Sea). It has a total of 700 cannons, small and large. But again, because of the tremendous hazard posed by the places looming above it, it has established peace treaties with the Seven Kings (i.e., Habsburgs) and with the Ottomans and pays them tribute and duties. But again, they are devilish infidels who have tricked the emperors with whom they are at peace to provide them twenty times the amount they pay them in tribute.

Within the walls the streets are so narrow and the houses so built up that there is not a single empty or idle space. Only there is a public square for executions and another for the marketplace, and also twenty-two courtyards of churches and monasteries.

The most imposing of these is the church of (—) (—) belonging to the king of Herzegovina. It is like a citadel to this castle, its cupolas covered with lead from end to end. May God vouchsafe that it one day become a prayer-hall of the Muslims. Aside from this there are also churches of the Venetian doges and of the bishops and the Bans and Herzogs. A Byzantine king once fled here from Macedonia – i.e. Istanbul – and had a church built which is also noteworthy and lead-covered.

The houses here are layer upon layer, like those of Galata in Istanbul, built of brick masonry and covered with tiles of slate or tin. And there are myriads of bells, large and small, hanging on every house and every church. They ring these bells on the eve of Sundays; on the festivals of St George (Sarı Saltık) and St Nicholas; Hızır Ilyas and Kasım (the spring and autumn equinoxes); the Virgin Mary and Kara Koncoloz; or on the Festival of the Christians (i.e., Christmas?) or a town council (turvin) or any one of their inauspicious holidays, and from the sound you would think the Antichrist had appeared.

This city has numerous Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Persians and Franks; but no Hungarians, Germans, Russians, Czechs, Poles, Swedes, Muscovites, Wallachians or Moldavians. Being a place of security and a safe haven of Christendom, it is a very prosperous entrepôt.





A remarkable spectacle, the strange and wondrous ceremony of the infidels


One night while sleeping peacefully in this city I was awakened by a great crashing noise and a hue and cry. At my wit’s end, I wondered whether the infidels intended to massacre us. We saw that all the Dubrovnikers were passing in procession in front of the house where we resided. They came group after group, young and old, male and female, officials and armed soldiers, all carrying two lit candles that illuminated the surroundings. We watched through the chinks in the windows which, as was their nightly custom, they had closed upon us.

Everyone was shouting, ‘Catch him! He went this way! He went that way!’ The soldiers and executioners went in and out of some houses of the Greeks and Armenians and Persians. They leapt up and down, and threw stones at the windows – even the windows of our lodging. ‘He’s in this room! He’s in that room!’ they cried, searching frantically for something. We, of course, having no idea what it was all about, merely marvelled at the spectacle.

After a while all the infidels started celebrating and prancing and dancing, crying Pişkindos pişkindos! They set off a myriad of muskets and rockets and cannons, with the cry Yajuj Yajuj! We were stunned and thought they had burned down the city.

Now all the hell-bound infidels drew up in regiments, passing row on row and wave on wave, crying Pişkindon! and sounding their organs and trumpets and Lutheran horns and clappers and pipes and drums, and boys with fine sad voices intoning songs in the rehavi mode.

Then came the monks and patriarchs and priests and cardinals, swinging their censers and perfuming the air with aloes and ambergris and storax and angelica. There followed troop on troop with tabors and drums and bells reverberating through the walled town. Then came twelve thousand women seated on jewelled palanquins; these were the wives of the officials, who conducted them through the streets. Others passed carrying ships’ masts, like cypresses, adorned with a myriad of little camphor candles that illuminated the city and turned dark night into bright day.

After this procession of women came the twelve Venetian officials, mounted on horses richly adorned with gold-embroidered trappings, themselves fully armed and magnificently attired, accompanied by their armed retainers and, on foot next to them, a gaggle of priests intoning the Gospel in the rehavi musical mode.

When they had passed, another large contingent appeared bearing a litter shrouded in fine gauze that was embroidered with gold and pearls and other gems. Inside were statues of Jesus and Mary – save the comparison! – smothered in jewels and silk brocades. The jewels alone were worth five Egyptian treasures.

Jesus – save the comparison! – was clothed like a priest, with a black vestment and a black mitre (?) on his head. His light-filled face set off the blackness of his locks, and he was seated on a throne.

Mary too was seated on a throne. On her head was a Mayfirav (i.e., empress or queen) crown, covered with various kinds of jewels that had been sent as votive offerings by the wives of all the kings. Around her neck were hundreds of pearl prayer-beads. Her nails were diamonds of 40 or 50 carats, and her eyes were carbuncles.

These were magical images, not at all like paintings on paper, but with clockwork movements and gestures just like human bodies, so that the viewer would think them to be alive. They are white magic statues, the utmost degree of artifice of the infidels; though lifeless and speechless mannikins, recalling the verse:

You can depict the fuzz on his cheek



And the beauty-mark on his arm;



But, O Bihzad, how can you draw



His coquetries and charm?





On either side of these statues people carried a myriad of candles and lamps, lighting up the night as though it were New Year’s Day. When the monks bearing these two statues on their litters had passed, and then the patriarchs with their gilded and jewelled and enamelled crosses, behind them came a band playing kettledrums and fifes and drums and organs and trumpets, who conducted the King of Herzegovina to his monastery.

These joyful celebrations kept up the entire night, illuminated by candles and lamps. I have hardly begun to describe them all. The next morning, when I questioned the military officer who was serving us as to the origin of this strange spectacle, this is what he told me, ‘Well, my lord, when our Lord Jesus was alive he summoned the Jews to the religion of Jesus. So one night the Jews kidnapped him and his mother Mary and imprisoned him. They intended to kill him, but since Jesus was the Spirit of God (cf. 4:171) the Jews were unable to kill him and just kept him imprisoned. Now our Latins of Simon the Pure (St Peter) got wind of this, armed themselves, and began to search for Jesus in the Jews’ houses in Nablus with a great hue and cry, just like last evening. They found Jesus and Mary in a Jew’s house and massacred all the Jews. Then they rejoiced, shouting Pışkındos pışkındos!, attired Jesus and Mary in garments and sashes, and brought them to a church. From that time until this, our Latin people have made statues of Jesus and have celebrated his rescue from prison on one blessed night of the year. This ceremony is peculiar to the Latins and not found elsewhere in Christendom. It was our Latin people who rescued Jesus from the Jews, and for that reason we are a harmless nation of Christians esteemed throughout the Christian community.’

This is what that infidel of a chief soldier related to us. So that night we were all amazed at this tremendous spectacle. But that night we had many frightful dreams.





Meeting with the Ban on the following day


The next morning a magnificent captain came with several soldiers and conducted this humble one and the treasurer of the Agha of the Nova janissaries in procession to the Doge’s Ban (pirinc-pirim ban – i.e., the Venetian governor of Dubrovnik). As we proceeded through the city, all the infidels came out to greet us, and as we could hardly move because of the crowds, we were able to take note of the marketplace.

Most of the shopkeepers are broadcloth and satin dealers, jewellers, paper makers, wood turners, knife makers, bead makers, bottle makers, candle-snuffer makers, ironmongers, butchers, barbers, tailors, and all the other merchants and craftsmen. The shops are laid out in good order, and very fine and busy. But there is no covered market, and the number of mercantile establishments is small in proportion to the size of the city. Quite a few of the craftsmen work at home; buying and selling in the marketplace being handled by women – both matrons and lovely maiden girls – who display their wears openly. In Christendom this is not considered shameful behaviour.

So we made our way through the city, viewing the markets and also the noteworthy houses of the infidels, until we arrived at the korta or palace of the Ban. If I were to describe this happy palace as it deserves, it would constitute prolixity and a hindrance to our travels. It is well-constructed, indeed, but somewhat narrow in proportion to the city. It is a mighty stone palace in five layers, with no point at which the walls could be breached. It has over 300 rooms, with vaulted halls, pantries and kitchens.

The walls of the audience hall are covered with paintings of bygone magistrates. In addition, there are depictions of future Ottoman sultans and of their own future Bans, with their precise features and dress, marvellously done according to the science of astrology.

During the reign of Sultan Murad IV (1623–40) Abaza Pasha52 – who as a Celali had shut himself up in Erzurum, then gave up his rebellion and came with Husrev Pasha to the Porte, where the pen of forgiveness was drawn over the register of his crimes and he was made governor of the Bosnian frontier – heard about the paintings in this audience-hall of the Dubrovnik palace, and wondered why these infidels had depicted the Ottomans below their own Bans. So he came in a forced march from Sarajevo to this castle of (Dobra)-Venedik and asked permission to enter, intending to destroy the palace. Some of the infidels were willing to let him enter, but one pestiferous priest said, ‘Once he has entered the castle, who can tell him to leave? He entered Erzurum once and shut himself in. Eight viziers over eight years could not get him out. Finally he left of his own accord and came to Sultan Murad, and his crime was forgiven. So if he enters here now, who can get him out? Let’s give him a little and beg him a lot.’

The Venetians gave Abaza Pasha 100,000 ducats, which was enough to persuade him to give up entering the castle. But he stopped to visit the shrine of Simon the Pure (St Peter), who is buried next to the above-mentioned Nazarete (lazaretto), and saw him lying in the tomb with a black manlifke headdress.53

‘Look here, infidels,’ said Abaza Pasha. ‘Wasn’t Simon the Pure the successor of Jesus?’

‘Yes my lord, that is so,’ they replied.

‘O damned ones! Since he was a Muslim, why have you put such a hat on his head?’

With that he removed the hat from St Peter’s head and replaced it with the selimi turban that was on his own head. The infidels were aghast. They gave him another 100,000 ducats. He removed the mücevveze turban54 and said, ‘Look here, infidels, I want you to erase the images of your kings from above the pictures of the Ottomans in your palace. Otherwise, when I come again, if I find them still there I will level your castle to the ground and put all of you to the sword.’

With this he left. From that time on they have repainted the depictions in this palace so artfully that not everyone is aware of them; but someone knowledgable in the science of painting who examines them carefully can appreciate their painterly qualities.

I entered the palace and toured it to my heart’s content, then came out through the Ban’s harem and sat on a chair. Now the twelve magistrates emerged through a door of this audience-hall. When they saw this humble one they stopped, took their Eflatuniye hats in their hands, and greeted me. I was obliged to get up, though I did so unwillingly, and stood in a respectful attitude, while they took their seats.

These magistrates have no claim of precedence among themselves; they simply sit in a circle, and thus no one of them is in a more prominent position. The government circulates among them, each ruling for one month of the year. But when they consult, they are always in agreement. If one of them dies, there is a pool of forty others, one of whom comes and enters the circle of twelve. If one of these forty dies, there is an outer group of 300, one of whom is prepared to enter among the forty. But none may enter the circle of twelve and sit on the throne until he is forty years old and in his prime. Such is their ancestral custom.

In short, when the twelve magistrates were seated on their thrones, I handed over the Sultanic orders and the letters of the grand vizier and of his deputy Ibrahim Agha. The magistrates all stood up and took off their hats again while inquiring after the health of this humble one and the health of the grand vizier and of the deputy. When the imperial orders were read out and their contents made known, they said, ‘It is the Sultan’s to command. Our treasure and our envoys are ready. According to the imperial command, we will give the salaries of 3,000 musketeer guards to Sührab Mehmed Pasha and Praçalı Mustafa Pasha.’

They cried benedictions upon the Sultan and grand vizier, and then continued, ‘However, the Nova galleys are always attacking our villages, taking our Christians captive and driving off our sheep and goats and cattle. If they do not give back our sheep, we will have our envoys, who are about to leave, register an official complaint and inform the Sultan about our plight.’

Now this humble one had in my hand orders from Sührab Mehmed Pasha empowering me to obtain the Dubrovnikers’ sheep from the Novaites. When I showed these decrees to the magistrates, they were very pleased and showed me even greater courtesy and increased my rations. They also showed great favour to the treasurer of the Agha of the Nova janissaries.

I stayed there a few days. Some of the magistrates feasted me and some came to greet me as ‘the grand vizier’s agha.’ I gave them embroidered handkerchiefs of the Kaya Sultan variety; they each gave me a honta (Italian conto?), meaning a sum of 20,000 dinars, also stuffs and muskets and falcons. The dinar is a silver coin, very fine and white and pure, but very thin. On one side is the figure of their chief Ban, on the other the figure of Jesus and the date since his birth. It is round like a penny; four make one drachm. It is the standard currency here; they have no other silver coins (guruş) or gold pieces; but their treasuries are very full.

51 The term used here is rabat which usually refers to the extramural settlement.



52 The following story is apparently based on an incident reported by Naima (III, 201; ed. İpşirli II, 776–7) that Abaza, then (1633) governor of Bosnia, wanted to visit Zadra. The Venetian authorities held a council and were about to grant permission when they were dissuaded by the argument that once Abaza was inside, they could not made him leave, nor could they kill him, from fear of breaking their treaty with the Ottomans. Refused, Abaza laid siege to the city, but the Zadraites sent an urgent message to the bailo in Istanbul who managed to get Abaza removed from office, so he had to lift the siege.

53 Probably the kallimavchion or cylindrical hat of the Greek orthodox priests.

54 Both large ceremonial turban types; for comparison, see Zygulski 1992, 105 (fig. 21), 111.





6. The great bridge at Mostar





The Grand Architect Sinan son of Abdülmennan Agha built this noteworthy bridge in the year (—) at the command of Sultan Süleyman. It rises into the sky like a rainbow, spanning the water from one cliff to the other, a single arch like the Vault of Chosroes in Baghdad. The Neretva River flows beneath it in the middle of the city of Mostar. Each end of the bridge is a fortified castle, so it is impossible to pass from one side of the city to the other without crossing this bridge.

The loyal brethren who hear my tale should know that this lowly slave, Evliya the unhypocritical, has been travelling non-stop for the past twenty-seven years. I have sojourned in sixteen kingdoms and have examined hundreds of thousands of buildings and monuments. Among these are the Çoban (Shepherd) bridge over the Araz River near Hasan-kal‘a in the province of Erzurum; the Altunhalkalı (Golden Hoop) bridge, also over the Araz River, between Erzurum and Malazgird; the Batman bridge between Hazzo and Mifarkin; The Hasankeyf castle bridge; the Antioch bridge over the Asi River; the Cihan bridge in Misis; the Adana bridge; the Tarsus bridge; Eğriköprü (Crooked Bridge) in Sivas; the Çaşnigir (Taster) bridge over the Kızılırmak; the Osmancık bridge over the Kızılırmak; the Geyve bridge, built by Sultan Bayezid, over the Sakarya River; and hundreds of other noteworthy bridges in Anatolia.

As for Rumelia, the bridges that must be seen are those of Sultans Suleyman and Selim II at the Çekmeces (two Marmara inlets near Istanbul); the Burgaz bridge; Sultan Murad’s bridge over the Ergene River; the Mihal bridge in Edirne; the Yeniköprü (New Bridge) and Sarrachane (Tannery) bridge, again in Edirne; the Koca Mustafa Pasha bridge near Edirne; and the great twelve-arch bridge of Vishigrad over the Drina River, built by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha.

But of all these bridges, the most noteworthy and the one most worth seeing is this peerless bridge of Mostar. For this humble one has journeyed in the lands of the Arabs and Persians and Turks and Franks, and as far as Balkh and Bukhara (!), but in all the inhabited quarter of the world I have never seen a lofty bridge like this. To be sure, the Batman and Hasankeyf bridges in Kurdistan, which I mentioned above, are extremely well-constructed bridges; but (they don’t match up to this one).

It is a single lofty arch, like the Vault of Khawarnaq, stretching from one cliff to the other, so high that a person crossing dares not look down. The total length of the bridge, from gate to gate of the fortified castles at either end, is 100 broad paces. The width is 15 feet.

Another noteworthy feature, and a mark of tremendous skill, is the channel consisting of bronze pipes that runs over this bridge from the Tabahane (Tannery) suburb on the western side to the marketplace on the eastern side. It was installed by Sultan Murad IV’s day-book clerk, Ibrahim Efendi. The channel carries water from the Radobola River for the baths, mosques, hans, imarets, medreses, fountains – in sum, for forty-five places in the city. The poets of Mostar have commemorated this good work with the following chronogram: (—) (—) (—) (—) (—) (—) (—) (—) (—)

This is a unique feature, unseen and unheard of elsewhere by travellers on land and sea, that water should flow both below a bridge and above it as well. A surpassing marvel!

The building of the bridge by Sultan Süleyman is commemorated in the chronogram kudret kemeri (‘Vault of Power’), the year 974 (1566–7). Another chronogram is this:

This bridge has been built exactly like a rainbow.



Is there anything like it in the world, my God?



Drawing the lesson, a wise man stated its date:



The bridge that others cross, we too will cross, my shah.



Year 973 (1565–6)





There are many chronograms for this matchless bridge, but these are the ones I can recall.

Truly, the master builder of old expended all of his skill in bridging the gap from one cliff to the other with a single arch. When viewed from a distance (i.e. with its reflection in the water) the bridge appears rounded, just like an archer’s thumbstall.

Nowhere else in the world is there such a bridge. No ancient architect has constructed anything like it for elegance and refinement. Actually, if you consider it, this spot calls for exactly such a one-arch bridge. On either side of the river are lofty cliffs, and the wide Neretva River flows below to a depth of a minaret. Accordingly, the Grand Architect Sinan made such a single grand vault, the likes of which no traveller has ever seen.

Despite the great height of this bridge, when some viziers and deputies and great notables and exalted magistrates come to sightsee and while they are residing in one of the above-mentioned two castles, some brave boys stand ready at the edge of the bridge and, in the presence of the viziers, cry Ya Allah and leap into the river, flying like birds. Each boy displays a different skill, whether somersaulting or plunging upside-down or sitting cross-legged; or they go in twos or threes, embracing each other and leaping into the water. God keeps them unharmed and they immediately clamber onto the shore and up the cliffs to the head of the bridge where they get rewards from the viziers and notables.

Other men do not dare look down, let alone jump off; if they did, their galls would burst; because the height of this bridge from the surface of the water is 80 fathoms, and the depth of the Neretva River is another 80 fathoms. Also there are rocks in the river the size of bath-house cupolas, and the river itself flows very wildly, with many eddies and whirlpools, flashing like lightning and roaring like thunder. It takes tremendous courage to plunge into water like that.

But the boys have trained. First they jump off low rocks, then higher and higher. Another form of training is that the boys who are apprenticed to tradesmen in the city, when they bring lunch from their masters’ houses to their shops and have trays of food and loaves of bread in their hands and on their heads, do not go in the middle of the bridge with these heavy loads but rather hop up and down on the thin railings that run along the bridge on either side. Prudent men do not even dare approach the edge of this bridge when they are crossing it, but immature boys hop on the railings! It is quite a spectacle.





VOLUME SEVEN





Habsburg Borderlands, Crimea and beyond





EVLIYA ENTERS ‘GERMANY’ (i.e., Austria) and leaves a German graffito on a huge tree. He participates in raiding expeditions in the Habsburg borderlands of Hungary. In the summer of 1664, he is an eyewitness to the Ottoman defeat at the Battle of St Gotthard (‘Battle on the Raab’). His experience in the field allows him to make generalisations about various European groups.

In the spring of the following year, he arrives in Vienna as part of the Ottoman embassy under Kara Mehmed Pasha to King Leopold I. The occasion for the embassy is the signing of the Peace of Vasvár between the Ottomans and the Habsburgs. Evliya’s account of Vienna is by far his most extensive of a European city. He is especially struck by the clockwork mechanisms in the city’s public squares and markets; the surgical techniques and medical practices in the hospitals and asylums; and the paintings and books, organ music and singing in the cathedral. His description of German language includes a prayer to the Virgin Mary.

The remainder of this volume covers Evliya’s travels in Rumania, Crimea, southern Russia and the Caucasus. He spends the winter of 1665 in Bagche-Saray, capital of the Crimean khanate, and participates in Tatar raiding expeditions under the auspices of Mehmed Giray Khan. In the following year he ventures to Circassia and the land of the Kalmyks. The outlandish customs and food-ways he observes in these places occasion some amusing stories, which have to be taken with a large grain of salt. He returns to Azov in January 1667.





1. Raiding expeditions in ‘Germany’; a fabulous tree in Krokondar





Account of our heading toward the merciless country of the Germans


One of the captive guides said, in private, ‘Would you like to do some more pillaging and get some more plunder without any trouble?’

‘Yes, we would,’ we answered, and he led us westward for six hours on a broad highway. The other infidels did not approve of us going on this road.

‘Why do you not want us to go this way?’ we inquired.

‘Not a Tatar or a Turk or any enemy has ever set foot in this country,’ they replied. ‘It is completely heedless, and there is much spoil to be had. But when you have got your fill of spoil, it will tie down your feet. Your Turkish army is far from you. They call these lands the German country. Kasım Voyvoda and 40,000 of his men were martyred here. You too will have difficulty getting out alive with so much booty. Also, all the German infidels have heard of you. Eventually, on your way back, they will attack you from behind.’

This reply and other like arguments seemed plausible, and some of us found it convincing. Others, however, said, ‘What will be will be. What they say is nonsense. We want some spoil now!’

The minority followed the majority, and that day we set out from Prondok and headed westward. We proceeded at a forced march along the skirt of the German mountains (i.e., the Alps?).





Description of the Fortress of Raytinad. It is a big city, under the authority of the mother of the German Kaiser. We left behind in the mountains all of our captives and abundant spoil with 2,000 gazi warriors and stormed into the city via a sparsely wooded grove on the north side of the fortress. In the twinkling of an eye, we overcame the garrison infidels with our swords. We found so much money and goods in their market and churches and ill-omened houses, and captured so many boys bright as the sun and girls lovely as the moon, each one a rose that had not yet bloomed and to whose skirt no thorn had yet attached.

The armies of Islam got so rich from the booty that they repeatedly let go what they had plundered and grabbed more costly items. In sum, the spoil got here amounted to 300 cartloads of assorted rare and precious things, a wealth of goods and wares beyond description. And all the Muslim gazis got their share.

In the centre of this city of Raytinad there is a huge ancient monastery, a Shaddad-like edifice more imposing and stronger than a fortress. It has a lofty dome resembling that of Aya Sofya in Istanbul, and 300 smaller domes, all covered with indigo-coloured lead. Surrounding it are four bell towers that reach up to the sky. The big dome in the middle is topped by a cross as tall as five men, the 300 others by silver crosses as tall as three men. All the crosses are gilded with pure gold. This huge monastery is prominent in Christendom and throughout the world because of these crosses.

The army of Islam laid siege to this convent, saying, ‘There is much money in this church!’ But the infidel convent turned out to have much artillery and in an instant seven of our gazis were martyred. We split open their dead bodies’ bellies, stuffed them with salt, and loaded them onto carts.

As we retreated from below this fortress with our spoil, we turned north and proceeded through thick forest, on German territory. Happening upon the trail of a large army, we questioned our captives about it.

‘This is the road to France,’ they said. ‘God knows, the French king must have sent reinforcements from Dunkerque and Denmark and elsewhere in Western Europe to our king. They have crossed the German mountains and gone to the fortress of Yanık (Yenikale/Zerinvar).’

We examined the tracks closely. They were the footmarks of a sea-like army that had just gone by.

From there we travelled westward for one day.





Description of the prosperous city and fortress of Krokondar. It is first and last a great city untouched by an enemy’s hand. It is German country under the authority of the German kaiser. Since it is surrounded by marshland, it was not possible to raid and plunder the place. We therefore halted in the open plain.

In the centre of this city also there is a huge fortress-like monastery like the Wall of Iskandar. Wayward King Ferdinand, who did battle with Süleyman Khan in Buda, is the founder of this unpraiseworthy building. It is a solidly constructed and prosperous convent, like a white pearl.

Passing this city we proceeded north through mountainous country, gazing at the lofty trees, God’s creation. By God’s Wisdom, there was one mammoth tree situated in a broad plain. No tree in the turning world gives such shade and bears such leaves and fruit. It has 300 branches, each as thick as an elephant’s trunk, with thin tart-tasting leaves like the parsley in Turkish salad. Although, by the Creator’s wisdom, everything sour is constipative, these sour leaves are as laxative as senna.

Its fruit is curious. All the fruit grows on the tiny tips of the branches, and the green-shelled fruit lines the tree’s 300 thick branches like acorns. When ripe, by command of the Living and Omnipotent One, they taste like hastavi dates from Baghdad and smell like musk and raw ambergris. And they are very invigorating (i.e., aphrodisiac). But there are no seeds.

This tree is unique; there is none like it on the face of the earth. 10,000 sheep can lie under the protective shade of each branch. There are chapels and little platforms with stone benches in seven places underneath its shade, and more than 300 taverns and brothels.

This tree rises up to the zenith of heaven. Its trunk is so thick that, as many of the gazi youths who were sitting in its shade gathered round me, seventy-seven of us, circling it hand in hand, could hardly embrace it. God’s creation is especially remarkable in this respect: a mighty river leaps into the air like a jet from seventy or eighty forked branches on this great tree’s lofty summit, and pours down into a large pool built of white German marble some distance away. As the water gushes forth, it makes a terrifying noise. The trunk out of which it spouts is as tall as a minaret, and the water jets up to the height of another minaret before it pours down into the pool. It is truly a grand spectacle.

In the environs of this large pool is an assortment of galleries fashioned in the Frankish style, ornamental fountains, water jets, and gilded pavilions with gushing springs. There are also kitchens and grottoes, orchards and gardens, every one constructed by a bygone king who made the endowment saying, ‘Let it be a picnic spot and pleasure park.’ It is a noteworthy attraction.

This humble one pleaded with the gazis and did not let them damage a single building. Now I got the iron chisel and hammer from my saddlebag and, mounting my horse, carved the following inscription on the huge tree’s bosom, in German language and imitating the German script:

Maria meaning, For Mother Mary

Kot kapurhand For God Almighty

Makar fand Evliya prays.





But the truth is that I carved this inscription in order to leave my mark in Germany.

When this humble one asked several of the captive priests for information – root and branch – about this tree, they related, ‘Our prophet Jesus was a world-traveller. He came here and planted this huge tree, a miracle to behold, as a sign pointing to the Danube in the German mountains. Thus the Danube River leapt into the air from inside this tree and poured down to the ground. Later our kings constructed this pool, the pavilions and the forts, as pious works.’

Indeed, in the seven climes and the lands of the ten kings, this humble slave has not seen such a magnificent tree and such an ancient and exemplary bearer of fruit to be endowed with spirit. God is capable of everything (2:20, etc.).





2. The battle on the Raab River (Battle of Saint Gotthard, 1664)





Summary of the gaza on the Raab River and the bad planning that led to the defeat of the armies of Islam at the river’s edge


All the veterans of the imperial council convened at the edge of the Raab. The decision was made to build bridges over the river, then to proceed past Nemet Uyvar against the fortress of Vienna in order to lay siege. A Fatiha was recited (to seal the decision). No one was able to speak up and say, ‘Since the beginning of winter, the army of Islam has conducted three campaigns. They drove out the infidels from the fortress of Kanizsa. They conquered Yenikale in twenty-eight days, and conquered seventy-seven other fortresses. So there is no strength left in the army of Islam. Now it is the depth of winter, and men, horses and donkeys are starving. How can we march to Vienna or Prague or Yanık in this winter rain?’

Because Gürci Mehmed Pasha and Ismail Pasha did not allow anyone to speak up, the officials continued their illusory deliberations, saying, ‘Today is Friday, so there is no battle. But tomorrow is Saturday and according to the Hadith, God has blessed Saturday and Thursday, let us cross the river tomorrow and devastate the land of the infidels. But since today is Friday, let bridges be constructed over the river at several points, and escarpments on both banks, and wide roads and huge ramparts and trenches at the bridgeheads.’

Yet there was no inclination in the army of Islam to cross the river and do battle.





This humble one soon realised the misery of the situation and the bad planning. Therefore I, with my sixteen horses and eleven servants, all starving because of reduced rations, one night secretly crossed over to the Tatar army, pretending that we were merely changing our campsite. I made camp in a place next to Ahmed Giray Sultan. The horses were happy moving from pasture to pasture, and this humble one forgot the cruelty and suffering. But not for a moment was I, along with one or two of my servants, ever separated from the presence of Ibrahim Kethüda and the grand vizier (Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Pasha).

Because the battle was planned for Saturday, on Friday the sergeants-at-arms gave firm warning and instructions, saying: ‘Tomorrow morning we will cross the river and there will be a great battle. Today let everyone go foraging and make provisions.’ So all the servants and thousands of brave youths went out to the fields for grain and fodder, and the army camp was deserted like a mill whose stream has been cut off.

On this Friday the grand vizier gave the imperial decree to Defterdar Ahmed Pasha, and five or ten thousand soldiers assembled before the courageous vizier’s tent. Right away logs were nailed together and a compact wooden bridge was constructed for the army of Islam to cross on foot. The gun carriages were tied with ropes, and ten companies of janissaries (commanded by) the keeper of the Sultan’s mastiffs, Abdi Agha, slowly made their way across the bridge. On the first day of the month, all the janissary gazis entered the trenches at the bridgehead on the bank of the Raab and erected ramparts before the trenches. Once they were settled in, several thousand horsemen crossed the river in the water.

This humble one too, thinking that I ought to cross and get some easy spoil while there were no infidels about, joined 5,000 soldiers and went westward for an hour at a forced march, arriving below Nemet Uyvar at mid-morning.

[…]





Account of the cause for the Ottoman army’s defeat on the bank of the Raab River


Because on this Friday the armies of Islam had some slight victories, raiding parties left to plunder the countryside. The emirs and the officials of the imperial council, however, had all become bigheaded and did not keep a watchful eye on the infidels. While the soldiers in the army were scattered about seeking spoil, news came that the spoil-seekers had in fact fled, and that the hell-bent infidels had set out from their staging-points west of the battlefield —the cities of Beşluka, Gratz and Brandeburg – and were on their way towards the fortress of Nemet Uyvar.

Since our arrival in German country, we had completely ravaged the land of the infidels. The infidels were left homeless and, saying ‘How can we take vengeance on the Turks?’ were stampeding like a herd of swine and, with their black hats and black heads, were sharpening their fangs like boars. Smothered in iron and armed to the teeth, and hauling their artillery guns, they came to the battlefield where we had previously fought and massacred them. Wherever they set their unclean feet they saw that the entire field was covered by infidel corpses. They sulked amidst the corpses for a good while and roamed about, then mounted their horses and slowly marched towards the janissaries’ trenches on the bank of the Raab. With them were their Generals and Grafs, Bans and Herzogs, cardinals and monks, advancing like black swine, inexorable.

On the left, all dressed in red as though soaked in blood, the French army appeared in red garments and green velvet, with white standards, and passed to one side marching rank on rank.

After them, the troops of the Zirinoğlu, Beganoğlu and Nedajoğlu, Kepanoğlu, İslovin, and Mekemorya passed, covered wholly in buckskin and wearing green broadcloth kalpaks. Each soldier had two horses and five or six flintlock muskets.

In sum, the troops of the Seven Herzogs passed by displaying their formations and consolidated on the right bank of the Raab.

After them, 40,000 or 50,000 German infantry passed in their battalions, with balaramada guns, commanded by the viziers named Zoza and Montecuccoli.

After them, the army of the Czech king filed past.

After them, the troops of the Girl King (Turk Louis) marched by, and the thousands of mastiffs they brought in carts that they would unleash onto the battlefields. They went and stood ready on the west flank.

After them, the army of the king of Dunkerque marched.

And after them, the troops of Denmark marched.

In a word, the Seven Herzogs, Seven Bans, Seven Kings, and two viziers came together, and all the infidels stood in their ranks.

Then all the monks, patriarchs, clerics, and priests lit ablaze the sticks of aloes wood and balsam in the braziers they held in their hands and intoned in the rehavi musical mode verses from the Psalter in the language of the Psalms: Fin sonderbares cuder gebbet alerheyligesten den kapuçinar Marya Kot. These verses thousands of the monks recited in a loud voice. And from hundreds of places, also in the rehavi mode, they sounded organs and trumpets and Lutheran horns. Some priests went around and distributed cups of wine to the infidels, but as though mounted on ants (i.e., at a snail’s pace), until they halted on the battlefield.

On this side was our bloodthirsty army of Islam. But they had got their spoil in the earlier skirmish. They were tired and weak. For twenty days they had suffered from nonstop rain. Men and horses were sapped of their strength, hungry and starving. Most of the soldiery were out foraging in the fields or pillaging a day’s journey distant. What good were they against the infidel army on the opposite side, wearing their black hats and covering the ground like a black cloud?

At this juncture the grand vizier took offence at the Tatar prince and did not invite the Tatar army to join the battle.

Now all our viziers and beylerbeys and the chiefs of the janissary corps drove the army of Islam against the infidels. The Muslim gazis cried, ‘In the name of God, we intend the gaza!’ Beginning with Ismail Pasha, the gazis from Sirem, Semendire, Kanizsa, Buda, Egri, and Esztergom joined us, and all prostrated before the Prophet’s standard, then advanced saying, ‘Don’t forget us in your prayers. Continue to recite Victory/al-Fath (Sura 48).’ And we recited verses from the Koran with musical intonation.

Once all of our seventeen beylerbeys, seventy sancak-beys and twelve viziers stood in their columns, first the infidels began to march out, then the army of Islam. Ismail Pasha with the army of Buda and the other frontier troops formed the vanguard and moved out. In the right column was the Aleppan vizier Gürci Mehmed Pasha and Salih Pasha; in the middle column, the army of the grand vizier, the army of Bosnia, and the regiment commander Ismail in the van. In the centre were 12,000 of the grand vizier’s picked soldiers, Segbans and Sarıcas of Croatian, Albanian, and Bosnian youths, and other champions. There were 20,000 other musketeers and janissaries. But the grand vizier did not cross the Raab, staying across the river with the rear troops.

The janissary infantry emerged from the trenches they had dug that morning at the river’s edge. As they advanced towards the infidels, the cavalry squadrons, in accordance with kanun, kept pace with them like two wings, wave on wave, and came to a halt. The four lesser divisions also stood in their ranks.

But there were several instances of poor planning. One was that they failed to bring forty or fifty light cannons that the army of Islam had across the bridge. Another was that they had the janissaries leave their trenches and sent the infantry to battle the infidels in the open plain.

At once, Ismail Pasha, the regiment commander Ismail, the Sultan’s sword-bearer Zülfikar Agha, and the keeper of the Sultan’s mastiffs, Abdi Agha, stuck their egret plumes in their turbans and put on their helmets. Smothered in blue armour, they urged on the cavalry to battle.

The agha of the janissaries Salih Pasha and the regiment commanders (—) Agha, (—) Agha, (—) Agha – in short, all the janissaries of the Sublime Porte – had emerged from their trenches at the river’s edge by the vizier’s command and moved a bow-shot’s distance forward. In the twinkling of an eye, they had dug some new compact trenches and entered them. Now they were ready for battle, as was the entire army.

First the infidels charged the army of Islam, beating on large and small kettledrums, blowing trumpets, ringing bells, and crying Yajuj Yajuj! The Muslim gazis, with all their heart and soul, cried back Allah Allah! and rushed upon the infidels as hungry wolves upon sheep and sheep upon salt. First on the field of bravery, on leaping horses, were the regiment commander of the Bosnians, Ismail, and the Sirem and Semendire beys. Besides them, other beys and beylerbeys and gazis entered the field of battle. They were so heroic in combat that they decimated the infidels like pigs in the first encounter.

The first of the base infidels to be broken was the German column, who fled to the mountains and vineyards. There were even infidels who took off to the fortress of Nemet Uyvar, which was in sight. The Muslim gazis saw straight away that the infidels were fleeing in this fashion and informed one another, proclaiming that the infidels had been routed. But as they pursued the routed troops, the French infidels, all wearing red, emerged onto the battlefield from the forest on the left side. From the right side came the soldiers of the Girl King. The Czech musketeers – fresh infidels armed to the teeth – also entered the battlefield in droves, bound to one another by chains, and attacked our army of Islam from behind.

Now the two armies engaged and there was intense fighting for six entire hours. On every side fresh and unscathed reinforcements for the infidels kept arriving. Drunken and berserk, they paid no heed to musket and cannon. In their zeal for their false religion they rained cannon and musket fire from seven columns, and nearly half of the grand vizier’s Segban and Sarıca troops were martyred at the first encounter. The other Muslim gazis, caught in Nimrod’s flames from the barrage of musket and cannon fire, gave way slightly. But the tricky infidels never stopped their onslaught. They continued to come, crying out, Piyan piyan!

Now the Muslim soldiers who had pursued and driven away the routed German infidels returned to the battlefield safe and sound. Realising that the base infidels had taken the field of battle and gained the upper hand, they immediately put their captives and the priests to the sword. The gazis, with all their heart and soul, shouted Allah Allah! and entered the fray, striking the infidels with swords. 10,000 of these able-bodied youths did not come out alive but quenched their thirst with the sherbet of martyrdom – for they were like a drop in the sea of infidel soldiers. Intoxicated with elest,55 they remained in that valley.

As for this humble one, assisted by God’s wisdom, I took not a single step from the shelter of the Prophet’s noble standard but continued reciting the Koran with my fellow reciters. At a certain point, an infidel was coming toward me chasing one of my slaveboys. The blood of this humble one, full of fault, stirred with zeal. I spurred my horse and went over to the battlefield, thinking that I should be a friend and protector to my slaveboy. It seems the infidel had another musket which he aimed in my direction. I ducked and the bullet struck my horse in the neck. The horse reeled beneath me and reared up, and I saw blood gushing from the wound.

When my slaveboy saw that the infidel had shot his musket, he himself released a splendid arrow of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqas. The infidel toppled from his horse, and the boy cut off his head and took it while the horse ran away toward the infidels.

Meanwhile, at a loss because my horse was wounded, I returned to the Prophet’s standard and turned my mind to God. Still I was distraught and said to Musahib Hacızade, the chief of our Koran-recital troupe, ‘Master, let me go back across the river. Look, my horse has been shot. One of my slaveboys can stay here in my place. Let me cross the river and get another horse. I’ll be back soon, God willing.’

‘That’s right,’ Hacızade replied. ‘Go to the grand vizier with this wounded horse; he’ll give you another one. And take with you the boy who cut off the head; get a reward for him as well. Also, we’re very hungry; have them send us what food is available in food tins.’56

This humble one realised that the field belonged to the infidels. For the army of Islam was in disarray and slow in battle, while the infidels were quick and fighting courageously.

I took my horse by the leading-rein, walking at a slow gait, and came with my slaveboy to the bank of the Raab. As we were about to cross, the scouts of the imperial council and the army drovers on the opposite bank cried out, ‘Shoot that pimp! Kill that pimp! Keep clear, pimp!’

I am an unmarried man, but I have often been cursed out with the term ‘pimp.’ I pointed to the blood flowing from the bullet-wound on my horse’s neck and shouted, ‘Men! my horse was wounded and has no strength left. I’m going to get another horse, then I’ll cross back.’

‘Well, who’s that boy next to you?’

‘He’s my slaveboy. He has cut off a head. He’s going to get a reward from the grand vizier.’

In short, a man needs a faithful friend and a loving companion in this Habsburg Borderlands, Crimea and beyond world. Quite a few of the men recognised me and said, ‘Leave that man alone. We know him. Let him cross and exchange horses.’

‘Evliya Efendi,’ said Ali Çavuş, who was Eğirkapulu Oruç Çavuş’s protégé, ‘come, cross over here. It’s deep but not hazardous. Just hold tight to the horse’s mane.’

He pointed the way. I struck the horse and we plunged in together. I did go under once – it was deep next to the shore – but I held tight to the horse’s mane.

‘Boy, don’t get separated from me!’ I yelled and, swimming Tatar-style on my horse, with a thousand hardships we managed to cross the river to safety. I again took my horse by the rein and came before the grand vizier.

‘Welcome, Evliya,’ he cried. ‘What news of the army?’

I answered thus (in rhymed prose):

‘Here in your presence it is evident:



A battle intense and without end.



If some of the soldiers of Karaman



Came to our aid, the army of Islam



Would find renewed life.’





I continued: ‘Hacızade, your slave, rubs his face in the dust at your feet and sends greetings. While we were reciting the Victory Sura (48) under the protection of the Prophet’s standard, my horse was struck with a bullet.’ And I showed him my horse.

‘Quickly, give Evliya a doughty horse,’ he said.

My slaveboy rolled the head before the vizier, and I continued, ‘In partnership with this boy of mine we cut off this infidel’s head before the Prophet’s standard.’

He gave the boy fifty gold pieces and this humble one eighty gold pieces, plus a purebred Arabian horse. I kissed his hand, then went to Hacızade’s tent and informed them that their master requested them to send over some breakfast in food tins. Then I went to my tent and dressed the horse’s wound with egg, salt, and alum. I mounted another horse and rode to a high spur on the bank of the Raab. Gazing across the river, I saw – great God! – that the infidels were victorious and our army verging on defeat. There was still fervent fighting going on. But our army at times could not endure the infidels’ attacks and often gave way or again drove the infidels.

[…]

(With the battle’s conclusion) I had no doubt at all that this day of rout at the Raab was like Judgement Day. And my complete faith in the Lord of the Worlds increased further. All the viziers had conferred together and thought they had made good plans. But Man proposes and God disposes. The strange thing was that due to one ill-planned order the janissaries left the trenches and this became the reason for the infidels’ taking the field, although at first the field belonged to the army of Islam. This verse in the Sura of al-Sharh is definitive proof: With every hardship there is ease. With every hardship there is ease (94:5-6). I witnessed this noble verse first-hand in this battle, since victory and defeat are in God’s hands; but in one moment the Lord Creator showed forth myriads of His creations.

3. Comparison of Austrians and Hungarians





The Hungarians are Protestants while the Austrians are Catholics. There–fore these two infidel groups are opposites to one another, despite their both being Christians. And, as the saying goes, Opposites do not join. Even though the Austrians are in control, from fear of the Hungarians they never venture into the region of Esztergom and Stolnibelgrad, whether armed or unarmed, except in large force. They communicate at the point of a spear, and never cross one another. To be sure, Unbelievers are a single community. Nevertheless, the Austrian state is solid, while the Hungarian state is quite puny ever since the time of Sultan Süleyman when the Corona (the crown of St Stephen) and Esztergom and 300 other walled towns were lost to the Ottomans. After that happened, the Austrians prevailed over the Hungarians and made them into their subjects.

Still, compared to the Hungarians the Austrians are like the Jews: they have no stomach for a fight and are not swordsmen and horsemen. Their infantry musketeers, to be sure, are real fire-shooters; but they have only a single rapier at their waist, and when they shoot they brace their muskets on a forked gun-rest – they can’t shoot from the shoulder as Ottoman soldiers do. Also, they shut their eyes and shoot at random. They wear large hats and long pointed shoes with high heels, and they never remove their gloves, summer or winter.

The Hungarians, on the other hand, though they have lost their power, still have fine tables, are hospitable to guests, and are capable cultivators of their fertile land. And they are true warriors. Like the Tatars, they ride wherever they go with a span of horses, with five or ten muskets, and with real swords at their waists. Indeed, they look just like our frontier soldiers, wearing the same dress as they, and riding the same thoroughbred horses. They are clean in their ways and in their eating, and honour their guests. They do not torture their prisoners as the Austrians do. They practice swordplay like the Ottomans. In short, though both of them are unbelievers without faith, the Hungarians are more honourable and cleaner infidels. They do not wash their faces every morning with their urine as the Austrians do, but wash their faces every morning with water as the Ottomans do.





4. A pleasure resort near Vienna; the free conduct of women





The river (—) flows through the centre of (Peşpehil/Schwechat). It is rather small, but a Water of Life nonetheless. It flows from Little Germany and sustains many villages, towns, and cities. It joins the Danube River at this city’s lower end after irrigating its gardens and orchards. These lie on both sides of the city, from end to end – rose gardens and paradisical parks like the Aspuzu garden (in Malatya). There are also lofty palaces and pavilions adorned with pools, water jets and water wheels. And there are belvederes and villas in the Frankish style, each artistically fashioned by a master craftsman. In every one of the Khawarnaq-like palaces, built with much expenditure, there are magical works of paintings, finely variegated, by painters like Mani and Arzhang, whose skill in the art of the brush is amazing. All the infidel notables and sophisticates of the walled town of Vienna take their pleasure for weeks and months in this city and in its gardens and orchards. And their darling boys and lovely girls swim in the river that flows through the city. Warmed with wine and arak, they embrace one another and enjoy themselves in every nook and cranny.

Because the climate is delightful, the lovely boys and girls of this city are renowned. Indeed, the men and women do not flee from one another. The women sit together with us Ottomans, drinking and chatting, and their husbands do not say a word but rather step outside. And this is not considered shameful. The reason is that throughout Christendom women are in charge, and they have behaved in this disreputable fashion ever since the time of the Virgin Mary.





5. Vienna





On bazaars and bedestans


There are altogether 5,500 shops, neatly organised and uniformly built. So prosperous and well stocked are they that each shop is worth an Egyptian treasure.

Street by street, each trade occupies a different main street. The watchmakers, goldsmiths, book-printers, barbers and tailors have shops that are decked out like Chinese picture galleries. And the shops are unequaled in the operation of wonderful objects and strange instruments. Alarm clocks, clocks marking prayer times, or the month and day, or the signs of the zodiac, clocks on a monthly or daily calendar, chiming wall clocks – all are functioning. And they make clocks in the form of various creatures, with moving eyes, hands, and feet, so the viewer thinks those animals are alive; whereas the master clock-makers made them move with wheel mechanisms.

Whatever mills there are in the city, not a single one is turned by a horse or an ox or a man. The mills – and the kebab skewers, the buckets of water drawn from the wells, even the carriages travelling in the countryside – are all set in motion with devious and devilish clockwork mechanisms, not with a horse or an ox. They are marvellous contrivances.

Furthermore, a carriage travelling in the open country can carry a load of a hundred quintals. The wheel mechanisms move what ten water buffaloes cannot. But this is so only on flat ground; going uphill is not so easy, and going downhill the carriage has to drag a heavy ballast load in the rear in order to reduce the speed. Perched on top is an infidel with an iron-tipped forked stick which he uses to steer the carriage right and left. To increase the speed, he winds up the carriage wheels like a clock.

Noteworthy features of the walled town of Vienna


First, in the above mentioned Elephant Square, there is a bronze elephant beneath a lofty arch that is as tall as a minaret. It stands on its four legs, and its eyes, ears, and trunk are always moving. When it is noontime, the elephant roars once, flaps its ears, rolls its eyes and lifts its trunk in the air. It raises its trunk as high as the roofs of the houses across the street, then strikes it once against its chest, giving out a booming sound like that from a large earthenware jar. Its chest is actually the bell of a clock. When the elephant strikes its chest twelve times with its trunk, they know that it is noon. It is an elephant clock, dreadful and marvellous. This place is called Elephant Street.





Another spectacle. In yet another corner and beneath an arch, there is a white elephant. It is a lovely and skilfully made elephant figure that strikes the night-time hours. Its inside is of bronze, but its outside is of elephant hide. Its behaviour is like that of the black elephant; but it is white magic, a masterpiece of art, that astonishes the viewer.





Another noteworthy object. At a crossroads, in a rather broad square, there is a gilded copper peacock, set in a copper tray the size of a large dining-tray, perched atop a red porphyry column. When it is midday, the peacock shrieks once, flaps its wings, and goes around the edge of the copper tray. It does this twelve times, sounding the hour with a deafening noise of shrieking and wing flapping.





Another work of art. In another corner is a gilded bronze goat. This is a most marvellous statue, as though it were an actual billy goat.





Another noteworthy object that has to be seen. In the place called Execution Square, beneath arches on both sides of the road, there are two rams, made of bronze but covered with sheepskin. When it is noontime, these rams are set in motion. They paw the ground once, then butt their heads against one another, right in the middle of the road. They butt one another’s heads so hard that the ground shakes from the blow. At noontime they butt their heads twelve times and the clock bells in their heads toll the hour.

When a man has been condemned to execution, they bring him before these rams, tie together his thumbs and big toes, and hang the criminal by hand and foot like a bag from the arch that is midway where the two rams butt one another. If the criminal has despaired of his life, he dies and his soul goes to hell. But if in fear of the butting of the rams’ heads he confesses his guilt, either he is released, or else the two rams butt the fellow twelve times in the square of execution. Such a butting would crush a Mengerusi elephant, let alone a delicate fellow like him.

When Süleyman Khan set out to besiege Vienna, they put the aforementioned clocks and these noteworthy statues on ships and took them to Prague, then later brought them back. In the year ’90 (i.e., 1090/ 1679) they will take them there once more, so it is said (referring to the prophecy of another Ottoman siege in that year). The streets are individually named after these noteworthy statues and are known by them.





The strangest spectacle. This humble one, full of fault, while sightseeing the city of Vienna, arrived at the market of the physicians. There are 100 shops. In front of a number of the shops, on chairs, sit Muslim captives wearing white turbans, Bosnian kalpaks, Tekke and Hamid caps, and Tatar kalpaks, even with the appearance and dress of Tatars. All have their hands and feet chained, and some of the captives from the community of Muhammad are dark Arabs, some youths, and others white-bearded old men. With sad expression and bent necks, they sit on their chairs busily pounding medicaments in huge bronze mortars – mace, cubeb, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, ginger, orris root, etc. Standing behind them are men with swords, as if to say, ‘Pound quickly!’ But the older men pound slowly and feebly, looking right and left, their strength all spent.

Feeling pity for these older captives, I took out my purse and was about to give them a few akçe. But Boşnak Ali Zaim of Esztergom proved one of those who prevent good works (cf. 50:25).

‘Leave them alone for now,’ he said. ‘Give them alms when we come back through this quarter towards evening. Now the owners of these captives are standing next to them and will take from their hands whatever you give.’

This seemed reasonable and I put the purse back in my pocket. After touring the markets and quarters and the ancient monuments that we had not yet seen, we returned towards evening to those captives. While we observed, the shops began to close. Several infidels came and unfastened the belts from the waists of the Muslim captives, then removed the turbans and kalpaks and caps from their heads and took off all of their clothes. They inserted a watch key into each one’s armpit and turned it. Immediately the hands and heads and eyes and eyebrows of all the Muslim captives stopped moving.

When they removed their headgear and clothing I noticed that they were bronze effigies of men, wound up like a clock and moving by means of clockwork mechanisms. I was lost in astonishment.

‘Evliya Çelebi,’ joked my companion Ali Agha, ‘give these captives a few akçe, for God’s sake!’ It was truly a strange and wonderful spectacle.

Dispraise of the cathedral of priests and monks


There are altogether 366 churches of patriarchs and metropolitans, lairs of the stubborn and dirty priests. But sixty-six of them are great monasteries, each house of mis-worship the un-good work of a non-upright king, and 300 are small chapels inside and outside the city.

Of all, the monastery named (St) Stephan in the very centre of the city is such a grand and ancient structure that nothing like it has been or will be built in Turkey, Arabia and Persia, or in the seven climes of Christendom. Travellers coming by land and sea say that it has no equal in the inhabited quarter of the world, and it is true.

While this humble one was sojourning in the Polish country I saw the (—) Monastery in the port of Gdansk at the ocean’s edge, and in Middle Hungary the (—) Monastery in the city of Kaschau – great cathedrals, finely constructed and richly adorned. But the Stephan Monastery in this city of Vienna is an ancient building and very prosperous. The amount of money in the treasuries found here, and the number of jewels and precious stones, God only knows.

Of all the churches that I have seen until now, this Stephan Cathedral is the biggest. The lofty domes,57 partially of masonry, are set on sixteen huge piers. And some parts have painted ceilings, finely variegated, supported by long cypress beams over vaults of Khawarnaq. The paintings and gildings are strange and wondrous works of magic in the Frankish style. The ridged roof over these ceilings is covered with fine indigo-coloured lead. And some parts of it are covered with varicoloured glazed tiles.

If a man looks at this convent from a far distance, his eyes will dazzle from the sparkle of the window panes of cut glass and crystal and from the gleam of the gold crosses, tall as a man, in 300 places. This great cathedral glitters like the gold mine of Mt Akra in Kurdistan and dazzles the eyes like a mountain of light. It is such a brilliant temple of Messiah-worship (Christianity).

The sixteen huge piers inside this cathedral are made of porphyry and ‘honeycombed’ and ‘jaundiced’ marble, each one worth ten Egyptian treasures. The tall columns were brought from the city of Sheba in the country of Yemen, which now lies in ruins and is the birthplace of Mother Balqis, the wife of Solomon. There is nothing like them in all the lands of the earth, syenite columns, God’s handiwork which has to be seen.

The length of this convent, from the back gate to the prayer-niche of Jesus, is exactly 300 feet, and its width 180. Between the galleries and arches are slender columns of nephrite, onyx, obsidian and jasper.

The walls and the small and large domes are covered inside and outside with mosaics of varicoloured precious stones and carved alabaster. The scoops in the moldings of the domes, walls and arches are adorned with glass beads and precious stones of various colours, white, black, green, red, etc. The jewels give lustre and beauty to this church. And the wall on the south side is decorated with valuable gems such as ruby, olivine, Nishapur turquoise, Yemenite carnelian, garnet, cat’s eye, fish’s eye, yellow sapphire, blue sapphire, amber, mother-of-pearl, and Ethiopian pearl.

The walls of the cupboards have niches plastered with raw ambergris and housing copies of the Gospel, the Torah, the Psalms, and the Koran. Important books by various authors in every language of the world are found here. There are hundreds of thousands of bound books, with special priests appointed for their care. It is a great library that has to be seen. There is no such collection of books anywhere in the world, except in Cairo at the mosques of Sultan Barquq and Sultan Faraj, and in Istanbul at the mosque of Mehmed the Conqueror, the Süleymaniye, the mosque of Bayezid the Saint, and the New Mosque (mosque of Valide Sultan). God only knows the number of books in those mosques. But the number is greater in this Stephan monastery in Vienna, since there are numerous illustrated books in the infidel script of every language, including anatomical texts and cosmographies with the titles Atlas, Minor, Geography, and Mappa Mundi. Our libraries, on the other hand, have none of these illustrated books, since ‘Pictures are unlawful.’ That is why there are so many books in the Stephan Monastery. When this humble one had a tour of it, with the permission of the head priest, I was lost in astonishment, and the fragrance of musk and pure ambergris suffused my brain.

Now, my dear, the import of this long disquisition is the following: These infidels, in their own infidel manner, consider these books the word of God. They have seventy or eighty servants who sweep the library and dust off the books once a week. In our Alexandria, on the other hand, there is a great mosque known as the Perfumers’ mosque supported by many pious foundations including hundreds of shops, hans, baths and storerooms; but the mosque itself lies in ruin, and its library that houses thousands of important volumes – including priceless Korans calligraphed by Yaqut Musta‘sımi, Abdullah Kırımi, Şemsullah Gamravi and Sheikh Cuşi – is rotting because of the rain. Worshippers who come to this mosque once a week for Friday prayers can hear the moths and worms and mice gnawing at the Korans. No one from the community of Muhammad stands up and says, ‘These Korans are being destroyed, let’s do something about it.’ That won’t happen, because they do not love the word of God as much as the infidels do. I only wish that God make that mosque as prosperous as this church, and that its servants and governors regard that abandoned mosque with the eye of compassion.

Thousands of servants bustle about this cathedral of Vienna on a daily basis. And there are priests and bishops, popes and cardinals and monks from the eighteen kingdoms of Christendom. Each of the Christian sects has its own corner where the infidels practice austerities day and night. And ever since the infidels lost Stolnibelgrad (in 1543) they have buried their kings and cardinals and archbishops in front of the prayer-niche and in the crypt of this cathedral. Both sides are lined with tombs, while the centre, up to the prayer-niche, is a treasury erected on 200 columns.

The amount of gold stored here the Creator of the Two Worlds only knows. The Groschen (i.e., silver) treasury is beneath the outer courtyard. Furthermore, when the chaste-starred daughter of a former king died – her name was İzarila Son (Isabella Asszony [Hungarian for ‘Lady’]) – thousands of millions of money (or goods, mal) and hundreds of millions of gold were endowed to this convent, and the endowment is still in force. Millions of money (or goods) such as these are buried here. For that reason, when the Swedish king drinks a full bowl of wine he takes the following oath: ‘May this crown and throne of Alexander, my grandfather’s throne, be unlawful for me if I do not gain possession of the money in the Stephan Monastery in the walled town of Vienna in Germany, and may this Swedish state be unlawful for me and my children.’ Such is the limitless amount of treasure to be found in this great church.

There are thousands of idols (i.e., statues) each worth an Egyptian treasure; myriads of highly wrought chandeliers, each the product of a master craftsman and a royal workshop; and so many thousands of gold and silver and jewelled oil lamps, candlesticks, lamp-stands, censers and chafing dishes, the viewer is stunned.

But the floor of this monastery is not covered with rugs; rather it is paved with the varicoloured mosaic stones and pieces of marble and alabaster, each resembling a bird’s eye, as recorded above. All around are 300 chairs, skilfully made from whatever materials God created on the face of this earth, each one donated by an erring king or a miserable nobleman. The infidels sit on them and worship Jesus according to their false doctrines. No chair, indeed, resembles any other; and the stolni – i.e., chairs – are made of bird bones and human bones, fish teeth and elephant teeth, and every kind of wood.

Just inside the south gate, at the back of this church, there is an organ gallery resting on eight slender syenite columns. The master stonemasons of our day cannot wield pick and saw to produce such a highly wrought pavilion. Only Sultan Süleyman’s gallery in the Kızılelma (‘Golden Apple’) mosque in Esztergom bears a resemblance; but this gallery of Vienna is taller. And there is nothing like the organ of David found here in the churches of any infidel country. It comprises 300 musical instruments, including drums and kettledrums and horns and pipes. The effect cannot be described by words, either spoken or written; one must hear it to understand it. It is an organ that has to be seen; as the verse has it, How can hearing measure up to seeing?

Indeed, all its musical instruments (i.e., the organ pipes) are arranged in rows over this gallery. To the right and left of these instruments are bellows made of water buffalo hide, with pine planks below and above. The priests pull up the top planks by pulleys and one bellow goes down while another goes up, so that the wind does not get cut off from the instruments and they continuously resound. Twenty priests are assigned to operate each of the bellows.

Ladders have been erected alongside these bellows. When the infidels wish to play this organ on one of their ill-fortuned days, there are seventy master magicians expert in the science of this organ – each one a paragon in the science of musical instruments according to Kitab al-Adwar (a famous thirteenth-century treatise on music), each one a master at the level of Pythagoras, Abdullah Faryabi, Ghulam Shadi, or Husayn Bayqara – who come and turn its wheels and tighten its screws, adjust its pipes and reeds, and begin to pull on the bellows. Meanwhile some German castrati climb up the ladders that are alongside the bellows and stand ready. When the top plank rises to its limit and starts to go down, the castrati get off the ladders and on to the planks and go down with them. As this is going on, a kind of cold wind blasts from the bellows that actually causes the pipes to vibrate and a different sound emerges from each one, astounding the listeners. When one of the bellows goes down, the castrati climb up ten (rungs of the) ladders and again get on the bellows. The other bellows are going up and down in the same fashion with the boys mounted on them.

The function of these boys is not merely to provide a weight to the bellows. The reason they have been castrated is to prevent their voices from cracking, so they can sing along with the sound of the organ and sadly intone verses from the Psalter in the rehavi musical mode.

It may be asked: ‘While the Jews recite the Torah and the Psalms because they are Mosaic and Davidic, these Germans are Christians, so why do they recite verses from the Psalter?’ The answer is provided by the Koranic verse, And We gave the Psalms to David (4:163), which proves that the prophet David recited verses from the Psalter. During his auspicious time, the German people had faith in David and acted according to the Davidic rite. Later they rejected the rite of David and adopted the rite of Jesus and so became Christians.

Now according to the Germans’ false doctrine, while David recited psalms in a mournful voice, he also played the organ. God gave David a sweet voice, and whenever he recited the Psalter, the cherubim would listen to his voice and cry out, ‘Glory be to the Creator!’ The organ is David’s miracle, through which thousands of unbelievers converted to the faith when he recited the Psalter.

{At the present time, among all religious communities, the prophet David is famous for the loud voice in which he recited the Psalms. Indeed, the most eloquent of the Koranic commentators have interpreted the verse, He multiplies His creatures according to His will (35:1), as referring to a mournful voice, on the grounds that a sweet voice is the sound of the world of spirits.}

So when the German priests and monks play the organ in the rehavi musical mode – and the castrati mounted on the two bellows in groups of ten recite the Psalter with their sweet voices and manifold tremulations in the rehavi mode – one’s lungs fill with blood and one’s eyes with tears.

Although the Germans recite the Psalter, they do so not in the (—) language as revealed by God to David, but translated into their infidel German language which I will record below.

Truly, this organ has an awesome, liver-piercing sound, like the voice of the Antichrist, that makes a man’s hair stand on end. In short, an unlettered man who listened to this organ would say it is the miracle of the prophet David and of Jesus the Spirit of God.58 But really it is neither a saint’s miraculous grace nor the miracle of a prophet. It is only white magic, a concatenation of musical instruments that scatters the wits of the listener.

Furthermore, inside this church, the head priest has a pulpit which he mounts to harangue the congregation on their ill-omened un-holidays. The tongue falls short in describing this pulpit. And there is another enclosure, a jewelled gallery reserved for kings, the work of a German master who truly demonstrated his skill. The master architects of old expended their best efforts and the master builders executed their finest work on this gallery and on this highly wrought church. No ancient architect on the face of the earth produced such a masterpiece. Only the Eternal Master could inspire such a marvellous work.





Account of the spectacle of images in the church of Vienna


There are so many statues and icons in this church, images of the sons of Adam, and so many idols – I had not seen so many since the conquest of Uyvar when I toured the great cathedrals of Poland, Czechia, Sweden, Hungary, Dunkerque, and the port of Danzig. I was on good terms with several priests and, partly as polemic, partly in jest, I said, ‘How many gods you have – God forbid! – that whenever you pass by one of them, you remove your hats and bow down and worship.’

‘God forbid,’ they replied, ‘that we should consider them gods. The sole Creator of you and of us is God, the Holy Spirit. God forbid that we should bow down and worship these images, or that we should pray to them for sons and daughters, blessings and worldly fortune and long life. They are only images of our prophet Jesus and his disciples, of our saints who came afterward and our monarchs who were world conquerors and pious endowers of good works. Whenever we behold these images, we respectfully offer our benedictions. Most of all, we show reverence to the prophet Jesus, because he is the Spirit of God. In our religion, it is permitted to make images. When our priests harangue the people, just as your sheikhs do, they have difficulty conveying their message with fine words alone. So we convey the message through images of the prophets and saints and paradise, depictions of divine glory. And we show hell with demons, flaming fire and boiling water, depictions of divine wrath. When our priests give sermons, they point to these images saying, ‘Fear God!’ But we do not worship them in any way.’

But when one sees the depiction of paradise in this Stephan Church of Vienna, which is the ill-fortuned seat of the German king, one wishes to die and go to heaven, recalling the Koranic verse (89:30), Join My servants and enter My Paradise. They have depicted the Gardens – of Eden, of Paradise, of the Heights, of the Lote Tree, of the Refuge (cf. 9:72; 11:108; 7:46; 53:14–15) – in an open space, layer on layer, pavilions of Iram, with great rivers and the pools of Kawthar, orchards and gardens with houris and youths, brocades and satins, Buraqs and angels, the Throne and Tablet and Pen. Truly, when it comes to painting, the Franks prevail over the Indians and Persians.

Opposite this heaven, in a dark corner, on the surface of a wall 50 paces in length, they depicted hell. When this humble one saw it, I recited from the Fatiha, Guide us to the straight path (1:6). When I saw the balance and scales, I recited from the Sura of al-Rahman, That you might not transgress the balance (55:9). When I saw the lowest valley of hell, I recited the verse, The hypocrites shall be cast into the lowest depths of the Fire (4:145). And when I saw the Ghayya pit of hell (cf. 19:59), I recited the verse, Woe to every back-biting slanderer (104:1). The valley of woe, the hill of scorching heat (saqar – 54:48; 74:26), the valley of perdition, the valley of the dungeon (sijjin – 83:7–8), the ridge of the flaming fire (sa‘ir), and the other levels of hell: all these did the master painters of the Frankish style illustrate with Mani-like precision. Those who see once the depictions of these tortures – men roasting in the fires of naphtha and tar; groaning at the hands of demons and the whips of tormentors; bitten by scorpions, snakes and centipedes, vipers as long as camels’ necks – will repent their ways of Nimrod and Pharaoh, Korah and Shaddad. They will cleanse themselves of backbiting and slander, adultery and fornication and pederasty, usury and wine drinking. They will leave off eating and drinking and spend the remainder of their precious life in a hermit’s cell, having washed their hands of the filth of this world, and will say, ‘It is God’s to command: if it is not to be heaven, at least let my place be purgatory and not hell.’

But the master painters, to demonstrate their skill, have depicted purgatory in this church such that those who see one part will be gladdened and those who see another part will be saddened. On one side is illustrated the place where the resurrected are to assemble, a jostling and woeful crowd, moaning and lamenting. Seeing these figures, one’s body trembles like an autumn leaf.

In short, my account of these depictions of heaven and hell and the place between is but a drop in the sea or an atom in the sun. It is impossible to describe them; you simply have to see them for yourself.

On hospitals and asylums


There are seven hospitals in this city. The busiest and best adorned is the hospital of the Stephan Church, where the sleeping garments and the quilts and sheets are made of silk and satin and cloth-of-gold. The king himself comes to this hospital if he is sick, because the physicians here are like Plato and Hippocrates, Socrates and Ptolemy, Feylekos (Philip) and Feylesof.

The infidels (in Vienna) wear black vests and Eflatuniye hats. But these physicians wear only plain white garments and a kind of cap of Russian leather and buckskin with seven gores. Their hands never come out of their gloves, since their hands always have to be soft. And the moment they take their patients’ pulse, they know the illness and treat it accordingly.

It happened that, in the battle on the Raab, a bullet struck the head of one of the king’s kinsmen, next to his ear, and remained lodged inside his head. Account of the perfect surgery of the masters. This wounded infidel would neither die nor accept treatment. Finally the king said, ‘There are so many excellent surgeons and phlebotomists who receive fixed salaries in the hospitals of my forefathers. Surely they can find a cure for this kinsman of mine. If not, I will cut off their provisions!’

This humble one heard that the chief surgeon of the Stephan Church was about to undertake the treatment, so I went to him. As we exchanged pleasantries, they brought in the wounded infidel and laid him down on a four-legged silken bed, as though he were blind. His head was like an Adana pumpkin, his eyes like Mardin plums, his nose like a Morean eggplant – everything was swollen.

The chief surgeon drove all the infidels out of the room, which was warm and had glass windowpanes. Only one of his servants and this humble one remained. The surgeon gave the wounded man a cup of saffron water to drink, which rendered him unconscious. He then lit a fire in a brazier and put it in a corner. While the servant held the wounded man’s body to his breast, the surgeon tied a strap of leather, like a knee-garter, around the edge of his cap. He took up a sharp razor and, sitting himself in front of the patient, made an incision in his brow from ear to ear and flayed the skin slightly from the side of his right ear, revealing the pure white skull bone. He did all this without causing a single drop of blood to flow.

Then the surgeon lightly pierced the fellow’s skull at the temple and inserted an iron clamp. As he turned the clamp’s screw, the skull began to lift from where the skin was incised along his cap. This caused the fellow to move slightly.

As the surgeon continued to turn the screw, the fellow’s bald skull, by God’s command, was opened at the joints that held it together like teeth, revealing the brain. The inside of the skull, between the ears, was filled with humours resembling watery blood and mucus. There, lodged in the brain’s membranes and glistening red with blood, was the bullet in its paper shell. It was apparently shot from a five-dram flintlock musket.

‘Come, look,’ said the master surgeon. ‘See this man’s sorry condition, all for a piece of bread!’

Taking my handkerchief from my bosom and holding it to my nose and mouth, I came forward and stared into the wounded fellow’s skull. By heaven, the poor man’s brain was all shrivelled, like a chick that had just emerged from its shell with its head, eyes, nose and wings shrunk and contracted. But the brain was covered with a thick envelope of skin, i.e., a white membrane.

The surgeon asked why I was covering my nose and mouth with a handkerchief.

‘I might sneeze or cough, or just through my breathing a draft might enter the man’s brain. I covered my nose and mouth to prevent that.’

‘Bravo,’ he said. ‘A hundred blessings of God. If you were to study this science, you would become a master surgeon. And from the way you paid close attention when looking at the man’s skull, I know that you have seen many things in the world.’

He deftly removed the bullet from the fellow’s brain with a pair of forceps. Using something like a yellow sponge, he wiped away the dried blood and yellow humours where the bullet had been lodged all this time. He washed off the sponge with wine and again wiped clean the inside of the skull and around the brain. Then he quickly put the skull back into place and tightly wrapped flat leather straps around the crown of the head and beneath the jaw.

Now he brought a box into the room and set it down. Spectacle of the surgeons’ wisdom. The skin of the fellow’s head had been incised from ear to ear, and now the two edges were brought together. Inside the box were giant ants known as ‘horsemen’ ants. The surgeon took one of these with his iron forceps and placed it head down where the skin of the fellow’s head had been cut. When the hungry ant bit the two edges of the skin, the surgeon cut the ant off at the waist with scissors, leaving the head still biting the two edges of skin together. He placed another ant next to it in the same manner. In all, he made the heads of eighty ants bite the skin of the fellow’s head from ear to ear, then smeared it all over with salve and bandaged it up.

Now he propped the fellow up in a corner on a down mattress, with pillows on both sides. He probed the wound with gauze, smeared it too with salve, and bandaged it.

Next, he fumigated the room with some foul-smelling incense; dabbed the man’s nostrils with wine that was forty or fifty years old; and smeared his hands, arms, chest, and neck – indeed, every part of his body – with clay of Chinese ambergris. Finally, he once again fumigated the room, this time with bitumen.

Food was then brought in, and when we had been eating for a full hour, the fellow opened his eyes and wanted food. The physician gave him some almond paste and chicken broth, and perhaps five drams of wine, nothing else.

This humble one returned there every day for an entire week in order to observe. On the eighth day the fellow had recovered sufficiently to move about inside the hospital. On the fifteenth day, he presented himself before the king.

[…]





Another praiseworthy art of the master surgeons. One day, while I was sitting in a surgeon’s shop, an infidel entered. He gave the surgeon a Hungarian gold piece and said, ‘My tooth aches. Take it out.’

Upon seating him in a chair, the surgeon took up his stylus and struck the man’s tooth. The fellow screamed.

‘That’s the tooth that aches!’ he said.

So the master surgeon brought in a lit brazier and placed some yellow brass wires59 in it. He also brought two bottles, one containing a blue liquid, the other a red liquid. Taking up a pair of wooden tweezers, he opened the infidel’s mouth, rubbed some of the blue liquid on the gum of the aching tooth, then laid hold of the tooth with the tweezers and pulled it out without difficulty and without any blood flowing. It was a magnificent tooth, a white, three-pronged molar.

He then took one of the red-hot wires from the brazier and applied it to the root of the tooth. It made a hissing sound from the marrow inside the tooth. He removed the tip of the wire from the rotten cavity and with it a tiny black-headed worm. He stuck another red-hot wire onto a second root of the tooth and a similar tiny worm emerged from the decayed part. Then, without touching the tooth with his hand, in the same fashion as he had extracted it he put it back into its socket. This time he rubbed on some of the red liquid and salt. He placed a small piece of wood over the infidel’s pulled tooth and told him to bite on it. The infidel bit down and the pulled tooth was set in its socket.

‘This tooth won’t ache any more and it is stronger than before,’ said the surgeon. All this time he never once touched the tooth with his hand.

As I observed this remarkable operation, a weight was lifted from my shoulders, because while playing javelin below Nemet Uyvar castle, Kıbleli Mustafa Pasha had struck my teeth with a javelin shot and three of them were dislodged. I showed them to the surgeon and he immediately rubbed some of the red liquid on the gums and had me bite down on a piece of wood, just as I described above. By morning my teeth had turned into Nakhchivan steel, strong enough to crack hazelnuts and walnuts. I was so delighted that I gave the surgeon a Kaya Sultan handkerchief. He was pleased and gave me half a dram of the red liquid in the little bottle.

‘If you give me a hundred ducats,’ he said, ‘I will teach you how to brew liquids like aqua fortis. In whatever country you travel, you can extract a man’s aching tooth with the blue liquid, then cauterise the marrow, reinsert the tooth and rub on the red liquid. So you won’t be idle in this world but earn a living.’

‘I’ll give you fifty ducats.’

‘No, no,’ he replied, ‘I won’t teach you for less than a hundred.’

I was too stingy to give that amount. But it is actually a wonderful skill, worth a thousand ducats to learn.

On another day, he took three Kreuzers (kralıçka) – i.e., three akçe – from an infidel and rubbed on the blue liquid. But he handed his tooth back to him, and the infidel left. Apparently the price of putting the tooth back in its place was one gold ducat.

In short, no country boasts as many expert physicians and phlebotomists, of which there are hundreds, as this Vienna. If I were to record all of the displays of skill I observed here and note them one by one, my unprinted notebook would be like the Canon of Avicenna. Moreover, there is no strain or difficulty in their work; it is all done easily and relaxedly.

There are even barbers in many of the surgeons’ shops. It is true that the German infidels wear their hear long and so have no need of haircuts. But they do shave a spot in the middle of their heads (referring to the monk’s tonsure?) and they wash their hair with musk-scented soap. And numerous infidels reach the age of seventy or eighty and still shave their beards.

When they go to the barber, first they sit on a high chair and his servants wash their hair and beard. Then they sit on another chair that is set on a stylus and rotates like a top. The barber sits in his own chair and easily turns the customer’s chair in whatever direction he wants as he shaves. The barber does not shave standing up as in Turkey. This is also something that has to be seen. The barbershops are pleasure resorts, adorned with fountains and other amenities.

And in no hospitals in any other country are there such endowments of buildings, food and drink and electuaries. First of all, any patient who recovers health at one of these hospitals brings the items he has vowed – plates and pots and trays and candlesticks of gold and silver and copper and tin. Every hospital has gold and silver vessels worth ten Egyptian treasures, and gold and silver skewers for roasting meat are leaning in every corner. Various dishes are cooked in gold and silver and copper pots and distributed to the patients according to their illness. Even delicacies such as bird’s milk and date milk and sugar cane syrup from Hama are stored in their pantries. Then there are the master chefs – whenever a king gives a banquet to another king, or a vizier or an ambassador, these master cooks come from the hospitals and prepare all sorts of dishes.

Actually, none of the food throughout Christendom is worthy of note. The infidels are abstemious at mealtime, eating fifty drams of food from the tip of an iron fork, and sipping fifty drams of wine. Dining is only found in the Ottoman Empire. Nor is there any cuisine to speak of in India and Persia – only their pilavs are worth mentioning.

Every hospital has a special kitchen where a head physician sits and prepares daily one quintal of sugary electuaries which they distribute to the sick and the poor. There are a myriad of canisters and jars for such pastes and beverages and sweets. Every hospital also has summer-rooms and winter-rooms with all sorts of basins and fountains. The winter-rooms have stoves as in a Turkish bath, the summer-rooms have fountains with jets. The windows of the rooms overlook gardens. Musicians come and perform concerts, playing various instruments, depending on each patient’s temperament. Strange to say, by God’s wisdom, there are not as many madmen in the German lands as there are in Turkey and Arabia. Still, there are many famous infidels in these asylums, and no one can find a cure for them.

Chapter: the ancient language of German


Some call it Nemçe, others Ungur, because it spans the provinces of Hungary (Ungurus), Germany (Alaman) and (—). It is an ancient Christian country that boasts its state goes back 2,600 years. Indeed, it is a powerful state that claims parity with the Ottomans and the kings of Muscovy. It is under the supervision of the Seven Kings. When one king dies, the others meet together with the emperor of this German Kaiser (!) and with his permission choose another king to take his place. First the king of Dunkerque, and the kings of Denmark, Holland, Czechia, Poland, (—) and (—) are all subject to the German Kaiser. In war time, each king comes to the Kaiser’s aid with 100,000 troops.

Yet the king of Sweden – which is on the shore of the Baltic Sea opposite the New World – has been able to terrify and harass the German Kaiser despite his 700,000 troops; because the Swedish king possesses 1,200,000 troops of Tatar nomads, plus other infidels whose number God only knows. There has been continual warfare between Germany and Sweden for the past 127 years. Only recently, in fact, the Swedes took seven fortresses from the Germans, who report that each one was worth the seven climes.

‘Indeed,’ they say, ‘we have concluded this peace with the Turks only because we have to deal with the Swedes. Otherwise, do you think we would make peace with the Turks after the Battle on the Raab (when we defeated them so soundly)?’

The Swedes pass as Christians and read the Gospel, but their language is different – I will record it in its place, God willing. They are, however, fire-worshippers (i.e., heretics) of the Protestant sect, while the Germans are true Christians and followers of the Gospel of the Catholic sect – i.e., the sect of the pope. The German language, however, is not the Spanish language of the pope. It is a very heavy language, which also has many Persian expressions; because the Germans too came from Persia with the descendents of Manuchahr.

As I mentioned above, because David played the organ and recited the Psalter, the scriptures that were revealed to the prophet David have been translated into German, and they sing psalms with the organ accompaniment. Here is one such verse from the Psalter in German: Fin sonderbares andaştiges gebet cuder alarheyligsten unt siligten yugunt firav Marya hilf avef den kapuçinar berkopa {meaning, fortress} soson. It is a hymn to Jesus and to Mother Mary. Indeed, it is recited in a loud voice by the monks as they pass through the streets and go from church to church with their cross-adorned banners and flags and with their organs. But when they sing this hymn in marvellous fashion, in the rehavi musical mode, it stuns the listener.

Another verse from the Psalter, a prayer to Jesus, as translated into German: Daler furtireflihste golorvirdiyaste alarheyligste ale çeyt unbeflekste yugunt firav Marya an matre unserris herres Yezu kırisıti in renigin der velt unt hersir in alarkıraaturen melke duniyemant verlest niyemant verehst avih niyemant ver cu dir mit raynin irt nirştend unt busfertigen Kot {that is God} Marya Firav {Mother Mary}. When the monks and boys with their sweet and mournful voices sing these precious words of the Psalter to the accompaniment of the organ, one feels intoxicated with love. For one’s heart expands when these verses are sung in the sofiyane meter according to the science of music.

As for the German language … First, when the Germans reckon in buying and selling they count as follows: ans 1 isçpa 2 tiray 3 fir 4 finf 5 sekes 6 siben 7 ahet 8 nayin 9 çen 10 çiyançet 20 tiraysik 30 firçik 40 fufçik 50 siyihçik 60.

57 As Kreutel points out (1957, 237), the Stephansdom in Vienna has arches and vaults, not domes. Evliya applies to the gothic building the language he customarily uses for Greek-style churches. Köhbach (1979) has shown that Evliya’s description of this and other European cathedrals follows a set of architectural clichés (‘Beschreibungs-Topoi’).



58 Ruhullah – an Islamic designation of Jesus, based on Koran 4:171 a spirit from Him.



59 Evliya specifies the wires as tanbura telleri, lit. ‘pandore strings’. The reference is to the tel tanburası ‘wire-strung pandore’ which Meninski (3129) says is ‘similar to our instrument’ (Cithara fere nostrae similis, sed plerumque trium sidium aenearum); cf. Farmer 1936, 36. Evliya has quite a bit of information about this instrument (Vol. 1, fol. 207b).





6. Crimea





Perekop: The Khan writes a patent of safe-conduct for Evliya to travel in Crimea


The Nureddin Sultan (heir to the throne of the Crimean Khan), who defends this place, had hundreds of light cannons fired from the fortress, and there were great celebrations. Afterwards, a banquet was given for the army of Islam with kebabs made from 100 steers and twenty horses, and 100 casks of boza were drunk. Five guruş per captive were taken from the army of Islam as savka (tax on captives). According to the register, during this blessed year seven gazas were undertaken in a single campaign – something not recorded in any historical chronicle. And it was recorded that (—) thousand captives, 300,000 horses, and countless other booty were captured in these seven battles. God be praised, this most humble one got seventeen captives and forty horses.

Now the illustrious Khan remained behind to defend this fortress of Or (Perekop). He bestowed upon me five slaves, five ambling horses – one of them complete with harness and saddle, and one sable çekman (a Tatar caftan); and upon each of my servants one horse, ten gold pieces, and one suit of broadcloth. This humble one bowed before the Khan and said, ‘My Padishah, I have come to the province of Crimea several times, and have participated in some felicitous campaigns, but I have not yet properly toured the province. I appeal to my Khan and offer my benediction.’

The illustrious Khan took up his jewel-scattering pen and said, ‘O nobles and guardians of Crimea, statesmen and elders: to whichever trading port or city Evliya Efendi – my comrade and friend, my confidant and wayfellow, my ancient associate – goes with this royal decree, bestow favour and hospitality upon him for my sake; clothe him and gird him; give him an allowance of kızılga gold pieces; provide him with reliable escorts so that he may tour my province; show regard for himself and his companions and his horses, and give them provisions. And you Ahmed Agha, commander of the fortress of Gözlev (Eupatoria): when my brother Evliya Çelebi arrives, house him in a palace; provide all of his food and drink; give him a daily allowance of one kızılga gold piece; when he departs, give him one sable caftan and 100 kızılga gold pieces; and in whatever direction he journeys, provide him with reliable escorts.’

Taking the papers, I bade farewell to the Khan.

The Karaites in Menkup


This mosque (of Sultan Bayezid the Saint) has one gate. There are no houses around it; it is an ancient place of prayer in a grassy plot. But a little below this mosque is a Muslim quarter with one neighbourhood mosque, 100 houses with tile roofs, a small bath, and two fountains. There are no other buildings.

Below this area are seven Jewish quarters from end to end. There are altogether 1,000 ill-omened Jewish houses, filthy and nasty, with tile roofs. There are eighty tanners’ shops. All the Jews make buckskins and shoe leather – in the country of Crimea, the shoe leather of Menkup is famous. There are only two butchers’ shops and one boza shop.

All the Jews are Karaite in rite, and the other Jews (yahudiler) do not like the Yids (cuhudlar) belonging to this rite. The Karaites do not distinguish kosher and unkosher foods. They eat whatever they are served, even if it is prepared with clarified butter, and any kind of meat, even with the tendon not removed. Indeed, they are the Kızılbaş of the Jews. On Judgement Day they will not mount the Kızılbaş but it will be the others, the Israelite Yids, who will mount the Kızılbaş. Or so people say, as in the verse:

The heretic on Judgement Day



Will be an ass beneath the Jew.





Although these Jews are Israelites and followers of Moses, and read the Torah and the Psalms, they do not know the Yid language (i.e., Ladino) at all. Instead, they all speak Tatar and they wear Tatar kalpaks of purple broadcloth, not hats. And due to Menkup’s delightful climate, they have very many lovely boys – ruddy-faced Jewish lads with doe eyes and sweet speech. Indeed, men from all over Crimea who are fond of boys come here to engage in pederasty. One such dissolute boy-chaser intoned the following naughty verse:



A Jewish lad did I pervert,



To Love’s religion did I convert.



Satan cheered: ‘Bravo! Well done!’





This verse is just a load of dirt.

Baghche-saray: Court protocol of the Crimean khans


First, whenever the illustrious Khan seats himself at the court, all the palace servants and ranking officials stand in their proper places according to protocol, with hands joined respectfully. On the right of the majestic Khan sits the Kalga Sultan (first heir to the throne). His territorial seat in this country of Crimea is the city of Akmescid (Simferopol). He governs 300 villages, as far as the fortress of Kiriş and the district of the villages of Güleç at the eastern end of Crimea.

On the left of the Khan sits the Nureddin Sultan (second heir to the throne). His jurisdiction extends from the Kaçı valley to the fortresses of Gözlev, Or (Perekop), Çikişke and Arbat. He adjudicates cases in 250 villages in this territory, under the authority of the Khan. The illustrious Khan, however, rules over all, including the Kalga Sultan and the Nureddin Sultan, and writes the royal decrees bearing the Khan’s signature.

Again on the right side stand the Hanafi şeyhülislam and the muftis of the other three Sunni rites.60 And on the left side sit the chief military judge Murtaza Ali Efendi and, below him, the molla of the city (chief kadi of Baghche-saray) and the twenty-four kadis of the Crimean peninsula. They adjudicate cases and decide lawsuits in their juridical districts. Should one of the kadis – God save us! – make a decision contrary to the Sharia or weak in assertion, the Tatar ulema give the misjudging offender no quarter but immediately put him to death by stoning.

The Khan’s vizier Sefer Gazi Agha remains standing; sometimes he sits by the Kalga Sultan. The superintendent of the ushers goes around with a silver rod in his hand and draws forward those with complaints; there are no gatekeepers at this court. The provisions officers also attend standing up, as do the finance minister who stands beside the Kalga Sultan and the court secretary who stands beside the Nureddin Sultan. The other officials – tax agents, treasurers, revenue contractors and court secretaries – stand to one side next to the daybook keeper.

After the council meeting, a Muhammadan spread is laid out with all sorts of dainties. A dish of horse meat is de rigeur, because the Tatar people follow the Shafi‘i rite and for them horse meat is strictly halal (permitted). The Khan, Kalga Sultan, Nureddin Sultan, the şeyhülislam, the chief military judge, and the molla of the city all sit down to eat together. The other kadis eat separately. The vizier and the mirzas (tribal chieftains) – including those of the Şirinli and Mansurlu tribes – sit in another place. The superintendent of the ushers and the head gatekeepers sit in yet another place. The notable palace servants dine with the finance minister. The tax agents, revenue contractors and provisions officers eat together in a different place. The Kazak sultans dine together with the princes. The court secretaries eat with the daybook keeper. In short, on the day of the high council, Muhammadan spreads are laid out in twenty-two places and all the members of the council enjoy the feast, after which they recite prayers and benedictions.

Anatolian refugees in Cherson


The Karasu River flows through this city, and its two sides are very prosperous and flourishing. The slopes on the south side mainly have houses of the Armenian subjects. The west side is a flat plain with orchards and gardens, and altogether there are 5,500 two-storeyed houses with tile roofs, occasionally thatched roofs. All around the city, lofty two-storeyed palaces have been built, so the city is thriving more and more. The majority of the populace have migrated here from the cities of Tokat, Sivas, and Amasya because of oppression in Anatolia. Having come to the Crimean peninsula, they now see justice. For that reason, the Crimean cities are becoming prosperous and beautiful.

This city is in the middle of Crimea, yet most of the houses only have a hedge around the courtyard. Since there is nothing to be afraid of, hundreds of houses have no stone walls but are only fenced in by hedges. And every house is sure to have a flowing stream.

Alchemy in Kaffa


In the forty-one years that I had been roaming the world until this time, I never saw a genuine practitioner of alchemy, although I saw thousands of impersonators. I rejected this science, considering that it was without foundation. But, God be praised, when I saw this Naib Ibrahim Efendi in this city of Kaffa, I witnessed the genuine article. He even gave me an ingot of gold, which I crumbled in my hand like wax. In fact, Ibrahim Efendi used to make tablets out of these gold pieces. He would swallow one in the morning and three in the evening, and eat nothing else that entire day.

Yet for someone to reach this level, this dervish status, he must be an upright mystic, one who busies himself with austerities and contemplation, preserves the mysteries, and withdraws from the world. In short, this work is the lot of him who belongs to the class of great saints.

60 The Ottomans and the Turks generally, including the Crimean Tatars, favoured the Hanafi madhhab or school of law. In Sunni Islam, the other three rites or schools – Shafi‘i, Maliki and Hanbali – have equal authority with the Hanafi.





7. A meal of strange honey in Circassia





A strange adventure


God is my witness that this took place. One day we were guests in a certain village and the Circassian who was our host wished to do a good deed. He went outside where he tarried a while. When he returned he brought a dinner-spread of elk skin, also a wooden trough – like a small vault or portico – full of honey and other troughs with cheese and pasta (millet gruel).

‘Eat, O guests, may it be permitted, for health of my father soul,’ he said (in ungrammatical Tatar).

We were starving, as though we had been released from Ma‘noghlu’s prison, and we laid into the honey so fast that our eyes could not keep up with our hands. But the honey was full of strange hairs that we kept pulling out of our mouths and placing on the spread.

‘Eat,’ said the Circassian. ‘This my father honey.’

Our hunger having abated, we continued to eat the honey at a slower pace, separating out the hairs. Meanwhile, Ali Can Bey, a native of Taman in Crimea, came in.

‘What are you eating, Evliya Efendi?’

‘Join us,’ I replied. ‘It’s a kind of hairy honey. I wonder if it was stored in a goatskin or a sheepskin.’

Ali Can, who knew Circassian, asked our host where the honey came from. The Circassian broke out weeping.

‘I took from my father grave,’ he said.

I understood the words, but didn’t quite grasp the import. Ali Can explained, ‘Last month his father died and he placed the corpse in a box on a branch of a big tree in the courtyard outside. Honeybees colonised the area around the groin and penis. Now, as a special favour, he has offered you honey with his father’s pubic hairs. These are the hairs you have been separating while eating the honey. Rather than excrement of bee, eat excrement of old man!’

Ali Can said this and went out. I followed him, with my gorge rising and my liver fairly bursting.

‘What kind of trick has this pimp of an infidel played on us?’ I cried.

Then what should I see? Our Circassian host also came out, climbed up the tree where his father was and refastened the lid of the coffin-box, all the while weeping and eating the horrible honey. When he descended from the tree, he said, ‘Hajji! When want honey, I bring you much father soul honey. Just say prayer.’

This was certainly a strange and disturbing event.





8. Kalmyks and cannibalism





A Strange Spectacle among the Kalmyks


Some of the Kalmyks live to be 200 or 300 years old. When a man’s vigour is spent and he can no longer mount and dismount, his kinfolk tire of dragging him around. They cook him a fat sheep’s tail and stuff it into his mouth, forcing him to consume it entire. In this fashion they put him to death, saying that he died a martyr. They also eat one another’s flesh, but this is done according to lot, as follows.

They have a man known as Karpa, next in authority after their Tai-shi or king. This Karpa has a four-sided wooden lot that has been passed down from his ancestors over several thousands of years. Each side is painted a different colour. When one of their leading men dies, they cast the lot to determine his fate. If the red side comes up, they interpret the oracle to mean ‘Burn him in fire,’ and they burn his body. If the black side comes up it means ‘Bury him in the black earth,’ and they bury his body. If the blue side comes up it means ‘Throw him into the water,’ and they throw him in the Volga River or in whatever body of water they happen to have camped near. If the green side comes up they cook his body and eat it. They only act according to the instruction of the oracle lot.

One day it happened that one of the Moyinçak Shah’s sons had died. They roasted his body, poured out the fat and blood, and were eating the flesh, accompanied by great merriment and festivity. When I passed by they invited me to the feast, saying: ‘Come, you too can partake of our emperor’s son.’

‘Can one eat human flesh?’ I asked.

‘Indeed,’ they replied. ‘We eat his flesh so that his soul will enter one of us. Thus he does not die, but goes on together with us.’

‘And who is your father?’ I asked.

‘He who made you and me and the Shining Mountain.’ Such was their blasphemous reply, and some words that I dare not write down. They have no sense of being infidels or going astray, no notion of the Last Judgement, of the Scales, of Paradise and Hell and Purgatory, of the Four Books, the Prophet, obligation and Sunna. They are simply beasts in the shape of men, the Yellow Tribe.61

‘Sirs,’ I cried, ‘can one really eat human flesh? Isn’t it bitter?’

‘It is bitter,’ an old Kalmyk said. ‘Don’t eat it. But if you want to know what it tastes like, just kiss a woman and see how sweet it is. If you eat human flesh you will derive eternal life from its sweetness and will live long, like us.’

In that meal, the body of one man was enough to feed forty or fifty Kalmyks. As for the fat, they smeared it over their faces and eyes and bodies; and they buried the bones.

VOLUME EIGHT





Greece and the conquest of Crete





RETURNING FROM AZOV to Crimea, Evliya encounters a landscape rich in fauna – horses, wild boar, migratory and hunting birds (on bird migration, cf. Volume 10, selection 12) – and in human drama: Kalmyk Buddhist weather magicians vs. Tatar Muslim fanatics. After reporting to the Ottoman court in Edirne, he returns to Istanbul in May 1667. By the end of the year he decides to leave the plague-ridden capital and join the Crete campaign, the twenty-five-year-long Ottoman attempt to conquer the island from Venice. After stopping in Edirne again to present Sultan Mehmed IV with some hawks he had obtained in Circassia, he departs on a tour of Greece.

In Komotini, he encounters a community of Romani (or Gypsies) and describes their language. His account of Athens reveals his attitude toward the ancients and their monuments – the Parthenon, now serving as a mosque; the Tower of the Winds; the Lion of Piraeus; also his knowledge of Greek, with which he was familiar growing up in Istanbul. His wide travels in the Morea (Peleponnesus) allow him to generalise on the ethnic make-up of the region. Taking passage from Corinth, he arrives in Canea in time to participate in the siege of Candia and the final Ottoman conquest of Crete in September 1669.

The following year, Evliya participates in the capture of Maina in southern Morea. A feature of warfare at that time was the taking and ransoming of captives; but in Kolorya Evliya discovers that not all captives wish to be ransomed. Later he is sent on another mission to Albania, where he attends a wedding in Ergiri Kasri. Stopping for one of the great Balkan fairs at Doyran (near Strumitsa in Macedonia), he returns home in December 1670. (The festive atmosphere of these fairs has its counterpart in the mevluds of Egypt; cf. Volume 10, selection 11).





1. Return to Crimea





We departed Azov with a besmele heading south through the Kipchak Steppe. We proceeded cautiously, posting guards in front and behind and right and left, and drawing up our wagons in defensive mode like a moving castle, with three cannons in front and three behind, and 500 light-armed cavalry in the van. After two hours we stopped at the stage of the Güğemli River and drew up the wagons in a defensive circle in a field of reeds and rushes, in fear of the Kalmyk Tatars.

By God’s wisdom, in this place, due to the extreme cold, the sun rose in four places. We could not discern which of the four was the world-illuminating sun that rises in the east according to divine custom (i.e., natural law). The Azov veterans who were with us said that it was forty or fifty years since they had last seen the sun rise like this in four places. The reason it occurs is that, due to the extreme cold, the sun over this Kipchak Steppe has no effect, and suns appear, when it is not dark, at the zenith over the other regions that are near the sea and so milder. But there has never been a sun over the country of Muscovy; only in the southern and southwestern directions, over Crimea and over Istanbul, the suns have stayed suspended in four places like fishing nets or sacks. Sometimes, by God’s command, suns appear in six or seven places, according to eyewitness accounts of the Nogay veterans and the veterans of the Muslim Bashkirs.

So this night we lay exhausted in the place called Güğemli. Only God knows what torments of cold and storms we suffered. As we were about to depart in the morning, forty or fifty horsemen came with letters from the envoy in Azov and from the Azov aghas, to the following effect, ‘My lord, take caution. 5,000 Kalmyks are preparing to raid your party.’

We received the news, but could do nothing except trust in God’s providence and sit at the Güğemli River waiting for help to come from Azov.

To be sure, this river was frozen; but its source is a two-month’s distance away, in the middle of the Kipchak Steppe, from where it flows until it reaches this point. Here, where it meets the Sea of Azov, it forms a wide channel and a gulf with reeds and rushes. Its source is a tributary of the Volga, near the shore of the Caspian Sea, from where it flows for two months through the Kipchak Steppe until it meets the Sea of Azov at this point. It was Tohtamış Giray Khan who first diverted the stream from the Volga and made it flow in this direction with the idea of cultivating the Kipchak Steppe. In the course of time it has silted up with mud and sand, and the water does not flow constantly.

As we were about to depart, a reinforcement of 1,000 fully-armed troops arrived from Azov castle. We all took heart at this, and with caution proceeded southwest through the Kipchak Steppe by stages to Akkumlar … Akkuğular … Çibir River … Kaburkalı well … valley of Yey … Üzengilik River. …

At this place our troops were set upon by eight wild boars that emerged from the reed bed. The boars, each the size of a Merzifon donkey, wounded some of the horses. The Muslim gazis rained arrows on them and they ran out onto the ice of the Sea of Azov, where they were slipping and stumbling because their claws would not catch hold on the ice. Now this humble one had two mastiffs with me, named Palu and Çakır; they took after the boars and, after a struggle, tore seven of them to pieces. The Muscovy infidels, whom the envoy had sent as reinforcement, ate the boars – for them it was like the festival of the Red Egg (Easter).

Again proceeding south we crossed the valley of Ahıryan … Kuru Eşim River … Çalpaş … stage of Akbaş … stage of Cibilli. … At this point the fresh meats and boiled meats that we had brought with us from Azov were all frozen hard as a rock and we had nothing to eat. Providentially, our Muslim gazis saw two wild buffaloes, each the size of an elephant, in the Kipchak Steppe and some took off after them.

‘Hold up,’ cried the other gazis. ‘These buffaloes never used to emerge from the reed beds and thickets in winter weather like this. They must have done so now because they were harried by the Kalmyk Tatars. Beware, don’t chase them!’

Some of the men paid no heed to this warning but, fully armed as they were, kept riding after the buffaloes, only to find themselves about to enter amidst the Kalmyk tents. The Kalmyk Tatars, of whom there were many, turned them around and began to do battle. Our men numbered only seventy or eighty, but these were very fine and fully-armed warriors.

In short, as the Kalmyks kept up the pursuit amidst fierce fighting, they came upon us. By this time we had readied the cannons and mounted our horses. We let out the cry Allah Allah! and attacked the Kalmyks all together. They could not even lift their hands, but in a trice 1,060 Kalmyks fell prey to the sword, seventy were taken captive and put in chains, and so many horses and garments and weapons were shared out among the gazis.

‘Do you have any men left in your camp?’ we asked the Kalmyk captives.

‘No, we are the only ones left. Those still in the camp are our wives and children.’

All the gazis armed themselves and, with leave from Ak Mehmed Pasha, in a trice attacked the Kalmyks’ (– illegible) and returned, unscathed and full of loot, with myriads of animals and women and boys.

When God desires something He prepares the intermediate causes. When God the Generous wishes to be generous to one of His slaves, He creates the intermediate causes. In this instance, God sent those wild buffaloes, which prompted our men to chase them, which led them to the Kalmyks, which brought the Kalmyks to attack us, which led the army of Islam to massacre them and then to get all their wealth as booty. So, with no one aware of what was happening, and with the pretext of two water buffaloes, God granted the Muslim gazis countless benefits in that dead of winter. As they say in Persian, He gives the pretext for buying but does not say how much it costs.

That night, in this place called Cibilli, we hunted down several wild buffaloes and turned them into fat buffalo kebabs. Until this time we did not dare to light fires in fear of the Kalmyks; but this night we made bonfires with reeds and rushes to cook the buffalo meat. We also, using our axes, cut to pieces the frozen mutton and bread that we had taken with us from Azov. Some of that meat we re-boiled in cauldrons, some we re-roasted in the fire, and the bread we re-baked by burying it in ashes.

So that night we celebrated. But in the morning we again posted sentries all around, following our usual practice, and drew up the wagons in a defensive circle with the Kalmyk captives on their mounts in the centre. As we proceeded southward at a trotting pace, it began to snow, and in the late afternoon we halted at the stage of Kertmeli castle. It was originally constructed by the Genoese and was reportedly a great city before being destroyed by Timur the Lame. Its large moats and some traces of its buildings are visible in a meadow at the edge of a brackish lake that is an inlet from the Sea of Azov.

Here we again saw two wild animals, this time horses, and gave chase. When we caught up, I shot one of them with seven arrows but still could not bring it down – the arrows seemed to sink in the horse’s body as though shot into a skin of butter. The horses reared up and ran off into the plain. I headed off the same horse that I had hit before and shot a Rumi arrow right into its eye. It planted its head on the ground and broke the arrow. As it was doing this I hamstrung its hind legs with my sword, which finally immobilised it.

My companions caught up with me and cut both horses to pieces without skinning them. We shared the pieces out among several hundred men and that night feasted on horse meat kebabs. This was in addition to the cooked meat and bread that we had brought out of Azov, that had frozen and that we re-cooked; because ever since leaving Azov, our provisions consisted of nothing but rabbits.

In the morning we proceeded at a trot across the snow, shivering from the cold, and came to Lake Biy. It took an entire hour to cross as we struggled and stumbled through the reeds and rushes, the water not completely turned to ice, neither solid nor liquid. The pieces of ice lacerated the forelegs and breasts of the horses and of the animals taken as booty from the Kalmyks. Once we got across, we were relieved; but many animals were left behind in the lake. I was told that two men got caught beneath their horses and drowned, but I did not see them. The lake was actually not deep, but torturous to cross because of the cold and blizzards and because it was full of swamps and marshes.

Emerging exhausted from this ordeal, we continued south for another six hours to the stage of Gölkonur. The Tatars give their lives for this place, which they call Altı Su Boyu (Six River Banks) because they are the banks of six streams that form inlets from the Sea of Azov. In the summer there is so much vegetation and pasture along these six streams that horses and camels get lost amidst the flowering grasses. That is why the Tatars give their lives for this delightful place. However, the Kalmyk Tatars have taken it over and use it for their habitations. They even stop here in the winter, since it is a busy passageway of travellers to Azov; but we did not run into any, thank God.

Here too the troops went out hunting. They caught two wild camels and two asgul or antelope. By God’s wisdom, while hunting here with my servants and companions and mastiffs and hounds, we ran across a wild horse. It was large and fat, the size of a Mahmudi elephant. I and my companions shot this horse with seventeen arrows and seven or eight bullets, but it still kept fleeing. Gradually the wounds took their toll and the horse slowed down, so that one of my slaveboys shot it in the girth by the ruddy foreleg, with a match-lock bullet. It fell once or twice to its knees and rose again. Finally I hamstrung it and, together with my companions, slaughtered and cut if up and shared out the pieces.





The reason I am relating this adventure is that, as God is my witness, I once had a dream during my childhood in which I was out hunting with hounds in a grassy plain, just like this Kipchak Steppe region, and I shot arrows at a wild horse and killed it. Now, forty-seven years later, my dream came true in this place, and I shot wild horses twice. It was quite a marvel!

When we came to this stage of Gölkonur we crossed the great inlets from the Sea of Azov in six places. They are wide bodies of water, some one hour across, some two hours; gulfs that penetrate a day’s journey into the Kipchak Steppe. Between them are wells of fresh water.

Formerly, when we conquered Azov castle in the year 105(0) (1640), the various Nogay clans used to nomadise along these Six Rivers: Ulu Nogay, Kiçi Nogay, Urumbet Nogay, Şıdak Nogay, Yaman Sadak Nogay, Deveyeli, Nevruzeli, Çobaneli and Arslanbeyeli. They would reinforce the army of Islam (i.e., the Ottoman army) by bringing grain below Azov and by selling their musk-scented clarified butter for three akçe per okka. They then dug wells and drank the water during their migration. But now the entire region from the Kuban River to the Kipchak Steppe is impassable because of the harassment of the Kalmyks, and the Nogays have sought pasture elsewhere, for God’s earth is spacious (4:97).





On the fauna of the Kipchak Steppe


The grassy meadows and beds of reeds and rushes of this Kipchak Steppe offer breeding grounds to geese, ducks, swans, bustards, shelducks, fieldfares, etc. The eggs of these birds rolled like pebbles beneath our horses’ hooves. Foxes, jackals and other animals feed on these eggs.

Indeed, the cranes that winter in the countries of the Blacks – Isna and Aswan (in Egypt), Sudan and Funjistan (in Africa), and Irak of Baghdad – migrate in the spring to these beds of reeds and rushes to lay their eggs and breed their chicks. They cannot do this in Arabia where their eggs would be cooked from the heat. As soon as spring arrives they depart those coastal regions for this Lesser Kipchak Steppe (Heyhat-ı Sağir) and for the Greater Kipchak Steppe (Heyhat-ı Kebir) on the other side of the Volga.

Indeed, when this humble one was travelling along the Volga and as far as the Ural River, the crane and goose and duck chicks were skittering on the ground and getting crushed beneath our horses’ hooves. We caught quite a few fat ones and cooked and ate them.

In this plain of the Volga there are more different kinds of falcons – called karçığa, toykun, sunkur, albay, laçin, bödene, topalken, kırgı, küykenek – than anywhere in the world. The ones called toykun and sunkur, each as large as a goose and having molted five or ten times, are known to have snatched up wild horses and wild camels and wild buffaloes and eaten them.

If you ask how that is possible, the answer is that the bird has trained itself and molted in such a fashion that its eyes become like red coral, and when it does not find enough ordinary prey to sustain itself it attacks a wild horse or camel. First it latches onto the horse’s hide with its claws and tears at the horse’s back with its beak while it settles on the horse’s head and covers the horse’s eyes with its wings to prevent it from running. Then it gouges out the horse’s eyes and breaks its spirit. It eats it willy-nilly, horse or buffalo or whatever it is, tearing at its groin. When it is full it takes flight and goes back to eating its usual prey, which is the corpses of foxes and jackals and other animals.

But the toykun and sunkur do not attack wolves, foxes, jackals or lions, because those are themselves beasts of prey. As for lions: the fur of the Kipchak Steppe lion is not sleek like that of the Baghdad lion, but hangs loose like the wool of an Angora goat; and the lion is a huge creature with a thunderous roar; so the toykun and sunkur cannot latch onto it with its claws.

The Bashkirs and Nogays train these Volga falcons – toykun and sunkur and other kinds that the Tatars call laçin – to attack people. When one of their enemies is riding alone in the plain, or any other place, they let loose two birds which harry the man from this side and from that and bring him down from his horse, no matter how stalwart and heroic the youth may be. Then they ride up and take their revenge on him.

God has endowed these birds with such splendour that they are dazzling to behold. Some have molted ten or fifteen times, so that they are milky white or milky blue or red like carnelian. Their wings are spotted with elongated black dots. Their eyes are like coral, or as though daubed with kohl. Their ears have more tassels than wool. Their beak is ruby-red like the beak of a phoenix. Their talons are as large as a lion’s paws.

Not every young man can bear one of these falcons on his fist, since each one weighs ten or twelve or eight okkas. Some men let it perch on their horse’s hide; or, if they bear it on their fist, they brace their arm on a forked stick wrapped in felt and stuck into the stirrup. Some young men bear it on their heads.

The birds are so well trained that while riding between stages they fly above your head and, when you shout to them, come and land on your arm. But if you dispatch them against a prey, the rustling of their wings makes the ground tremble and stuns the animal they latch onto. And these birds are not dispatched against geese or cranes or partridges, which would simply get crushed from the swoop of a sunkur or a toykun; rather they are usually dispatched against wild horses or wild camels or stags or buffaloes.

The animals in this Kipchak Steppe – wild rams, deer, fallow deer, antelope, roe deer, woolly Chinese gazelles, onagers or wild asses with black stripes on their backs, wolves, jackals, foxes, boars, bears, etc. – graze as otav, meaning herds of one or two thousand. And they live by eating each other, which is why the steppe is almost impassable because of the animal bones. The furs of red fox known as the Azov navel-bag come from here.

I could go on describing this Kipchak Steppe for a year and still not exhaust the subject, but this much will suffice.

We departed Gölkonur and again proceeded southward, galloping over the steppe, for eight hours until the stage of Yamançe Karaağaç.

From Azov to this point the journey across the Kipchak Steppe is fifty-four hours going at a brisk trot. Otherwise, going at a leisurely pace, it is twenty stages. The entire length of the Kipchak Steppe, from the Caspian shore in the east to Kılburun castle on the shore of the Özü River in the west, is ninety-seven stages.

God be praised, we came unharmed from Azov as far as Yamançe Karaağaç where we entered the forest, lit huge bonfires and cooked the meat of camels, stags and buffaloes. We feasted merrily, but still placed sentries on all four sides.

This is the only forest to speak of in the Kipchak Steppe; although there are many forests along the Volga and Ural and Kuban Rivers and the shores of the Caspian Sea. Leaving the forest of Yamançe Karaağaç we headed west, munching on wild pears and sloes and crab apples and acorns as we approached the river. Praise be to God, after galloping for (—) hours we reached the great Kuban River and took refuge in the forest along its shore.

The soldiers from Azov, who had come as reinforcement and escorted us to this point, now removed the heavy baggage from the carts and, leaving some carts with us, asked leave to return. Just then the governor of Azov, Monla Gani Pasha, crossed the Kuban River on the ice (coming from the Circassia side) to the Kipchak Steppe side with his 3,000 soldiers and camped in the forest where we were. Meeting with Ak Mehmed Pasha, he donned a vizierial sable fur and got letters from the Pasha for the Azov notables and for Süleyman Pasha. That very night, in the moonlight and the freezing cold, and taking along our military escort and the carts and fifty cannons, they turned and headed to Azov, putting their trust in God. They also took ten Kalmyk captives with their wives and children from Ak Mehmed Pasha to serve as hostages and to assure their safe return to Azov.

As for our party, several hundred clever individuals – indeed, the majority of our soldiers – as soon as the governor of Azov, Monla Gani Pasha, had crossed the Kuban River on the ice with his soldiery, decided to cross over on the ice into Circassia and set up their camps there. The rest of us remained in the great forest on the Kipchak Steppe side of the river, turning our kebabs and feasting merrily.

But many of those who had been exposed to the blizzards and extreme cold, and then sat down next to the fire, got frostbite in their hands or feet, or glaucoma in their eyes, and ended up lame or blind; some even died while sitting around the fire. Praise God, this humble one did not let my slaveboy companions too close to the fire, but even in the blizzard we sat on the snow under the trees, sipping hot toddies and supping on hot soups and munching on wild pears and apples and sloe plums.

That night we stationed sentries all around this copse, also 100 or 150 musketeers in the trenches on each side of the forest, in fear of Kalmyks and of Circassian robbers. We also took pains to transfer the heavy baggage over the ice to the other side of the Kuban River. Only light-armed horsemen remained on this side.

In the morning, by God’s wisdom, the ice on the Kuban had broken up and the river was neither ice nor water (i.e., something in between). So we were left with the soldiery in the forest on the Kipchak Steppe side. Ice floes the size of a threshing-floor were flowing down the river, and it was impossible to cross to the Circassia side.

Finally a group of stalwart youths, fortified with arak and mead and boza, made rafts by tacking together rushes and reeds and thick dried branches. On these they loaded the wagons and the loads from several hundred pack-horses and conveyed them across the river. Everyone tried to put his horses on a raft, but most were brought across swimming. Once on the other side, the horses were stabled in the houses of the Circassians and Nogays. Some Circassian youths and Nevruz Mirza Nogays came across in their çırnık caiques to escort the rafts. They also brought across Ak Mehmed Pasha along with his aghas and his imam Ibrahim Efendi and Cafer Agha; they got to the other side in safety, thank God.

As for this humble one, I refused to be separated from my baggage. But I also did not expect the rafts to come back and get me. Making common cause with some tried and true gazi youths, we inflated goatskins and tied their mouths tight; tethered the horses to them by the tail; loaded onto them my sword and bow-and-arrow case and shoulder-muskets and other lightweight items. Then this lowly slave stripped naked in that wintry day of purgatory and – astride an inflated bladder between two horses, with my Tatar whip in hand and crying Yov yov! – I crossed the river together with my servants and horses. God be praised, I got wet only up to my knees. Quite a few youths crossed the Kuban River safely in this fashion.

It turned out that one of my horses – an alaşa or Tatar gelding – either would not enter the water because of the cold, or else had crossed back over, and was now stranded on the other side and stood there neighing – no one else was left. I summoned up courage and, taking refuge in God on that day of hazard, naked as I was, mounted my roan alaşa that had been given me by the military judge of Crimea, Murtaza Ali Efendi and, striking it with my whip, recrossed the great Kuban River between the ice floes and drove the other horse into the water.

One of my hounds, named Vaşak (‘Lynx’), had also been left behind. I took it onto my saddle bow and plunged back into the river, then left it on a large ice floe. The dog made its way across, now skipping from floe to floe, now swimming in the water. I too reached the other side in safety.

As I was putting on my clothes and my fur-piece, we noticed a troop of 40 or 50,000 Kalmyks drawing up on the opposite shore. They were stymied when they saw that the river was no longer frozen solid and that all our troops had crossed to the other side. As they were standing there on the opposite shore like Azov foxes, the gazis of Mehmed Pasha’s soldiery who still had functioning hands and feet began spraying them with bullets from their forty- or fifty-dram dalyan muskets, and the Nevruz castle garrison began shooting at them with their şahi cannons. In one volley several hundred Kalmyks fell to the ground of perdition on the snow in the forest, and seventy-five Kalmyk veterans tumbled down like sacks from their horses, while the remainder took flight.

When the Circassian and Nogay champions saw that the force of Kalmyk infidels had been broken in this fashion, 2,000 musketeers and 3,000 horsemen quickly crossed the river on rafts and pursued the fleeing Kalmyks. Soon they returned to the river bank with 2,000 heads and 300 live captives. There they stripped the corpses of the Kalmyks who had fallen from the volley of musket- and cannon-shot, taking their horses and equipment and even their filthy garments. Having recrossed the Kuban River on their rafts, duty done and booty won, and having rolled the 2,000 heads at Mehmed Pasha’s feet, all the Circassians and Nogays were awarded a purse of guruş.

Now all the troops entered Nevruz castle, lest the Kuban freeze up again and the Kalmyks return. Those who found no room inside the castle fortified themselves in trenches outside the walls and appointed sentries all around, so they were also safe from Circassian robbers. That night everyone slept soundly.

[…]

We were proceeding in the dead of winter, wracked by blizzards and storms. Suddenly a toykun falcon that was perched on my arm died from the cold. It was a clever bird, molted seven times, with coral eyes – a bird fit for the Sultan. In fact I had brought it with me all the way from the Volga and Ural Rivers, in the Muscovy country, thinking that I would give it to the Sultan as a present. Judgement belongs to God.

I had one other toykun and two sunkurs. Hoping to keep them alive, I took the jesses from the feet of the dead bird and the collar from its neck, tore out its (– illegible) and pinions, and left its body there. They say that birds – like cats and dogs and other such creatures – do not have graves, meaning that one does not bury them. That is why I tossed this toykun’s body on the ground of perdition and went on my way. Because on a day like this, when we were being harried by Circassians and suffering the infernal torture of cold, if someone’s packhorse were to collapse, his servants would not stop to pick up the load but would just continue on their way.

After suffering these torments for several days we arrived at the stage of the village of Şağake. It was described above in my earlier journey to Dagestan with Mehmed Giray Han. This time we camped here. Some of those who sat around the fire had their eyes dazzled and went blind. Some others – including Sarraczade Mehmed Çelebi and a few other of our lord Ak Mehmed Pasha’s personal retinue, and the taster, and twenty of the müteferrikas – had frostbite on their hands or feet and had to have the limbs amputated with a saw and cauterised with boiling pitch. Those who survived this operation screamed to high heaven.

It is known to God, the Knowing and Wise, that none of this humble one’s slaveboys or companions, as we passed from stage to stage of this journey, suffered a loss to any part of their bodies. But we generally dismounted and walked (to keep up the circulation); and when the horses got cold we remounted and rode them around for a bit until they reddened (i.e., warmed up). Each day we suffered a thousand such torments before coming to another stage. The old men in our company bore witness that they had not seen winter weather like this in forty years.

In short, we wanted to bury the seven men who died in this village; but though we struck the ground with thousands of picks, we could not break through a single inch. Eventually we had cauldrons of water boiled in the Circassian houses and poured on the ground, and in this way were able to dig up just enough to bury each man.

[…]

It is the otar – i.e., farm estate – of Ömer Agha, the kinsman of Sefer Gazi Agha who is the vizier of our lord Mehmed Giray Khan. We stopped here for seven full days and could not go out safely in any direction because both the Yeleşke and Adahon straits were in a semi-frozen state.

God be praised, on the eighth day we got news that the area in front of Kızıltaş castle was frozen over. We loaded our baggage onto carts and pack horses and made a forced march westward for two days until we arrived at the Kuban River. But it was not frozen over. Nor were there any boats. We were overcome with a grieving sensation difficult to describe. It turned out that those damned Circassians had got tired of feeding us for the last eight days and providing us with grain, so they made up the false report that the Kuban had frozen over.

Wondering how we were going to pitch our tents, since the tent-pegs would not go into the ground because of the ice, we had no recourse but to attach the tent ropes to the carts and to some trees. So we pitched the tents in this manner and thought they were stable. But then a very rough wind sprang up that tore apart all of the tents, whirling them into the air. The squall overturned many of the carts and hurled others, without their horses or oxen, far into the steppe so that we lost trace of their turning wheels.

Poor Ak Mehmed Pasha had crawled under a cart to hide, although he was a very dignified vizier. The wind turned the cart over and Mehmed Pasha barely escaped with his life. All hell seemed to have broken loose. Everyone was thinking how to save himself. Some of the experienced gazis said, ‘Tatar gazis! We are the victims of magic!’

Mehmed Pasha, who kept his wits about him, told all of his staff to begin reciting the Mu‘avvizeteyn. As they did this over and over, the strong wind died down, by God’s command, and the weather cleared a little.

Still, on this side of the Kuban there was no village or any sign of civilisation. We were left in limbo, with no grain or even a mustard seed. Everyone began to tremble like autumn leaves. We were really in a quandary.

At this juncture an ancient Kalmyk Tatar with a scanty beard approached the Pasha and said: ‘Pasha, swear that you won’t harm me.’

The pasha put his hand on a Koran and swore: ‘Neither I nor my servants will harm you.’

‘My lord,’ said the Kalmyk, ‘it was I who just now raised this calamitous wind upon your heads and had it sweep away so many carts and so many tents. I did it to demonstrate a small part of the science that is in my possession. If you wish to cross this river, give me one horse and one bow-and-arrow case and one fur garment and 100 guruş. I will summon up calamity again and make the river freeze up. Then you will easily cross to the other side and to safety, and will be delivered from hunger on this side.’

Poor Mehmed Pasha, helpless, agreed and gave the Kalmyk even more than he had asked for. The Kalmyk took the items, tied them down a little ways off, then went into a wooded glade. He was still visible where he was standing in the woods. No one else knew what was transpiring, only this humble one and the Pasha and his secretary.





A marvel: the effects of magic of the Kalmyk Tatars


The sun by this time was shining brightly. I followed the Kalmyk and stayed hidden some distance away amidst some trees so I could observe. The first thing he did was to loose a shower of piss at the foot of a tall tree. Then he bared his buttocks – excuse the expression – and turned to face the open air. Standing up he took some excrement from his anus, put it in his mouth, then did three somersaults on the snow. Returning to the pile of his excrement he put both hands on the ground, raised his feet into the air and braced them against the aforementioned tree. He stirred up his excrement with his left hand and rubbed some on his forehead with his finger. For quite a while the Kalmyk remained upside-down perched over his shit.

What should I see next? The sky began to darken in the eastern and western and northern directions. The sun faded above us. The sky turned deep blue and then black. There was thunder and lightning. A horrible wind blew up. The bluish cloud seemed to break into pieces and descend to earth.

Now the Kalmyk brought his feet down from where they were braced against the tree. He turned around three or four times near his excrement. Occasionally he scooped up some of it in his hand and threw it into the air, at which lightning struck and all hell broke loose.

At this point our soldiers began to swarm around the shore of the Kuban. Everyone looked for some means to cross the river. The Kalmyk wiped off the excrement from his forehead with snow and started walking toward the soldiers. I ran behind him and, when I caught up, greeted him in the Kalmyk language, ‘Mandu tav.’

‘Tav mandu,’ he said, returning the greeting. He took a stone out of his mouth the size of a walnut, rubbed it on his eyes and put it back in his bosom. He wiped some more excrement off his forehead with snow. Twirling about, he approached the Pasha whom we found standing at the shore of the river.

‘Don’t cross yet,’ said the Kalmyk. He himself crossed over the ice first with a hopping gait, then recrossed to our side. Now all the soldiers on foot began to cross back and forth. The ice was still paper thin but, as God is my witness, when the men crossed, the ice crackled beneath their feet and cracked into segments the size of a dinner-spread.

This place, opposite Kızıltaş castle, is the point where Circassian territory comes to an end. The garrison of Kızıltaş castle, on the other side of the Kuban, made their way on foot across the ice to pay their respects to Ak Mehmed Pasha. They bowed down to the ground and kissed his foot, then stood up.

‘Hurry!’ said the Pasha. ‘This very hour, while the river is frozen, convey our baggage and carts and animals to the other side so they will be safe in Kızıltaş castle.’

The garrison soldiers responded to this insistent appeal by crossing back to fetch hundreds of sacks of sand from the castle. They poured the sand over the ice to make narrow roads for the horses, lest their hooves slip and pierce the ice. Then the first thing they did was to bring their sheep from the castle across the ice to Circassia.

As God and the Prophet are my witness, I swear that this is how it happened. In one month (!) the Kuban River, which is like a sea, was frozen solid to the depth of an arrow. But, by God’s command, it was not ice like polished crystal such as one sees in Muscovy in the Volga and Ural Rivers. Rather, the thick ice was in some places sandy or muddy, though in some places it was clear.

The Kuban at this point is about as broad and deep as the Golden Horn from Unkapanı on the Istanbul side to the Meyyit landing in Kasımpaşa on the opposite shore. In some places the ice was so clear that one could see large fish swimming underneath.

At the lower part of this crossing one could hear the waves of the Black Sea crashing onto the shore. The waves came over the ice right up to the front of this Kızıltaş castle. Despite this, the people and children of Kızıltaş celebrated the arrival of the Pasha and pranced about on the ice without fear, skipping like gazelles.

First they sat the Pasha alone on a raft with two tall masts which they drew with cables. So the Pasha got safely across and sat down on a prayer rug waiting for the others.

First came his retinue, leaping across the ice single file like a flock of cranes. Whoever tried to cross slowly was drawn under the ice and drowned. God knows, if someone stamped on the ice, it made a hole, so thin was it in spots. If one went forward and stamped, the ice behind became flat but the ice in front formed a hole.

God be praised, all the horses got across, one by one. Then came the carts which were empty since men on foot had already carried across all the baggage. They removed the wheels, tied ropes to them and to the carts, and hauled them across while keeping their distance. The horses, similarly, were hauled one at a time by men on foot who pulled them by their halters, while keeping their distance, over the paths of sand that had been poured onto the ice. My slaveboys also crossed safely with their eighteen horses and horse carriages and proceeded to the quarters in Kızıltaş castle where they had been put up the previous year.

Meanwhile, however, the Pasha’s secretary had remained behind with seven or eight narrow-minded individuals. ‘We refuse to cross this ice that was produced through magic,’ they said.

‘They should cross over quickly,’ said the Pasha, ‘if they know what’s good for them.’

But the secretary was very despondent and did not get out of the cart. The Dagestani fanatics who had stayed behind with him began to haul the cart while crossing on foot. At the same time, some were reciting the Mu‘avvizeteyn, some calling on God with such beautiful names as Ya Dafi‘ (O Warder off of evil!), Ya Hafız (O Preserver!), Ya Rafi‘ (O Exalter!), Ya Allah.

Suddenly the secretary’s cart broke through the ice and got stuck. Poor Ibrahim Çelebi – that was the secretary’s name – fearing for his life, scrambled out of the cart and crawled some distance away from it over the ice. But the six fanatical Dagestani Muslims passed beneath the ice and were drowned. His other ten companions, calling on God and reciting the Koranic spell, kept falling through the ice as they stamped on it. Some drowned and some got back to the shore.

What apparently happened was this: as they called on God’s names and recited the Mu‘avvizeteyn with great fervour and sincerity, the magic that produced the ice was rendered null and void and the ice was broken through. Some were saved, some were drowned.

When the Kalmyk saw this melancholy state of affairs he approached the Pasha, removed his kalpak and threw it on the ground, crying, ‘Woe upon my yayşılık!’ – i.e., my magic.

‘My lord,’ he continued, ‘warn those men not to recite anything in Arabic as they cross. And tell them to cross with a hopping gait. Soon it will be noon and my yayşılık will be neutralised. They should just keep crossing!’

By now all the soldiers had made their way across. But poor Ibrahim Çelebi, the Pasha’s secretary, with his small retinue, was turned into a ship’s monkey. He had managed to escape drowning. He approached the Pasha weeping, too exhausted to speak, a lifeless form. His servants brought him to his quarters and he took to his bed.

After the Pasha and all the soldiery had crossed to this side of the river they formed into regiments and paraded beneath Kızıltaş castle. The garrison responded with a welcome salute of ten cannon shots. This angered the Pasha’s brother and the Bey’s hoca and several other busybodies who berated the gunners and the castle warden, ‘Hey you bastards! Why are you shooting cannons and spoiling our fun in this depth of winter?’

They were shouting from a mile away. ‘Stop shooting, you infidels!’ They came to the Pasha and requested him to cut off the heads of the castle warden and the gunners.

‘Why should I kill them?’ said the canny pasha.

‘My lord, should cannons be shot in this depth of winter?’

‘It is their kanun for castle wardens to have a gun salute whenever a vizier arrives.’

‘Fuck their kanuns!’ said the hoca. He went off to his quarters disgruntled.

The castle warden held a feast, after which, at noon, the muezzin began to deliver the call to prayer from the castle minaret. As soon as he cried Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar! by God’s command, the river ice that had frozen because of that Kalmyk’s magic started booming like cannons and cracking into pieces. Soon there was no trace of ice – it was as though the river had never frozen, as though it had all been a dream.

As God is my witness, this is how we crossed the ice in front of Kızıltaş castle. Afterward the Kalmyk took his presents and disappeared.





2. Report to the Sultan in Edirne





I went to the Sultan’s deputy Kara Mustafa Pasha and presented him with the falcons he had requested when we last met. He in turn instructed the memorandum-keeper to take two of the most splendid birds to the felicitous Padishah. All the chief falconers and imperial hunters marvelled at their size and beauty, declaring that they had never seen anything like them. ‘Tell whoever brought these to bring more,’ cried the Padishah. When the Sultan’s deputy informed me of this imperious command, I swore up and down that there were no more, but I could not get out of it so easily. Finally I showed him the wings and tails of the birds that had died in Circassia. He brought them with me to court and I respectfully presented them to the Padishah, explaining that they had frozen to death in Circassia and that I had no others. I took an oath to that effect.

Vani Efendi – God bless him! – piped up and said, ‘My lord, I have known this Evliya Çelebi since our days in Erzurum and his service with Melek Ahmed Pasha. He is true to his word, a world-traveller and boon-companion to mankind, and your loyal servitor. If he had other falcons he would not keep them back from my Padishah.’

‘Yes, I know him too,’ replied the Sultan. ‘When I was a child he did us great service in the household of Kaya Sultan.’

I twice kissed the ground before him, showered him with benedictions in Tatar dialect, and regaled him with my adventures tracking down those birds in Muscovy, Dagestan, Circassia, the Kipchak Steppe, and the lands of the Kalmyks; and in the land of the Bashkirs where there is no bedtime prayer for seventy days and we did not perform the evening prayer.

As I was relating this, Vani Efendi piped up: ‘Yes, in that country they do not perform the evening prayer, because the time of morning prayer comes after two hours of darkness.’ He too asked me all sorts of questions, and I duly answered them.

The felicitous Padishah questioned me for seven full days about my travels over the past three years – in Poland, Czechia, Sweden, Germany, Holland, Hungary, and Croatia – and more particularly about Vienna and Yanık. On the eighth day he rewarded me handsomely for the falcons and I returned to the Sultan’s deputy and recounted the entire episode.

The next day I bid farewell to all my patrons, saying that I was going to Crete, and got quite a few favours from them. I sought leave of the Kaymakam Pasha, who fixed allowances on me and wanted to attach me to the suite of his other aghas. I kissed his hand and said, ‘For the sake of your noble head and the spirit of the late Köprülü Mehmed Pasha: this poor servant is one who struggles on God’s path (or, performs jihad). I have been conducting the gaza ever since the gaza of Azov. For seven years now I have wielded the sword throughout Christendom, along with the wind-scattering, enemy-shattering Tatars, from Crimea to the lands of the Cossacks and Muscovy and Poland and Cracow and the Czechs. For God’s sake, don’t keep me from this gaza of Crete. The Grand Vizier is now reportedly in the city of İstife – let me catch up with him there!’

‘Now Evliya Çelebi, don’t forget to pray for us in that gaza,’ he said and gave me 200 gold pieces and a suit of clothing, also thirty gold pieces and one suit each for my servants, plus six courier horses and seventy or eighty letters.

We bid farewell. I left quite a few of these gifts in Edirne and departed for the Candia gaza on the island of Crete on Monday, the 15th of Ramadan, in the year 1078 (28 February 1668).





3. The Gypsies of Gümülcine (Komotini)





Ever since the days of the Pharoahs, the original home of the Gypsies of Rumelia has been this town of Gümülcine (Komotini). In fact when the Gypsies take an oath among themselves they swear ‘by Egypt and by our Gümülcine.’ As for the Gypsies of Anatolia, their original home is the town of Balat in the sancak of Menteşe. Even now Balat is the name of the quarter where the Gypsies settled when Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror transferred them from Balat to Istanbul. To be sure, Sultan Mehmed also transferred to Istanbul some Gypsies from this Gümülcine. But the Anatolian and Rumelian Gypsies did not get along well. The Rumelian Gypsies celebrated Easter with the Christians, the Festival of Sacrifice with the Muslims, and Passover with the Jews. They did not accept any one religion, and therefore our imams refused to conduct funeral services for them but gave them a special cemetery outside Eğri Kapu.

It is because they are such renegades that they were ordered to pay an additional harac. That is why a double harac is exacted from the Gypsies. In fact, according to Sultan Mehmed’s census stipulation, harac is even exacted from the dead souls of the Gypsies, until live ones are found to replace them.

Finally the Rumelian Gypsies returned to their old hometown of Gümülcine, while the Anatolian Gypsies from Balat remained in the Balat quarter of Istanbul as quasi Muslims and as musicians and dancers. So the Bey of the Gypsies (i.e., the official in charge of collecting the gypsy harac) sometimes resides here in Gümülcine. For there are numerous Gypsies in the vicinity of the town, whether singers and musicians, or counterfeiters and thieves. Every people has its Gypsies, as does every one of the Christian nations. But the Gypsies in the vicinity of Gümülcine are notorious brigands.

[…]





The peculiar language of the Gypsies of Rum


The various peoples spread over the seven climes have their various languages. But each people also – by God’s command – has its Gypsies, who speak the language of the country where they are settled. However, the Gypsies of Balat in Anatolia have their own peculiar language. And also these Gypsies of Gümülcine have their own peculiar dialect. The Gypsies in this region and throughout the Ottoman domains originated in Egypt, when Moses battled with Pharoah on the shore of the Red Sea near the Sinai desert and 600,000 of Pharoah’s soldiers – along with his magicians and diviners and the tools of their trade – drowned in the whirlpool at the place known as the Strait of Kolundur. Moses put a curse on the people of Pharoah who were not present at that battle. As a result of the curse they could not remain in Egypt but were scattered abroad, condemned to wander from clime to clime and from town to town, hungry and homeless, dwelling in the mountains and the valleys, and raiding and thieving.

[…]

In the time of Moses the people of Pharoah split into two groups. One group, consisting of several hundred thousand who escaped drowning in the Red Sea at the Strait of Kolundur, fled to Rum, as mentioned above. The other group, who were neither on the side of Pharoah nor on the side of Moses, are known as Copts. Moses was not angry at them, but rather he blessed them, and today they are the much-respected Coptic people of Egypt. […]

But the ‘Copts’ – i.e., the Gypsies – in Rum, because of Moses’s curse, live in contemptible and squalid circumstances, and even their dead must pay harac. It was concerning this group, while they were still soldiers in Pharoah’s service, that God revealed the verse: from every stubborn tyrant (11:59). Truly they are tyrannical, good-for-nothing, thieving, irreligious people; they pretend to be Muslims but are not even infidels!

They have thousands of other such naughty expressions. For they are always quarrelling among themselves, day and night, and cursing each other out with obscenities. They commit murder for the sake of a penny. Or else they insist on bringing their case to the Pasha or to the Sharia court, and when it is adjudicated it turns out to be over a penny or less. For that reason gypsy legal claims are not heard. The Copts in Egypt, on the other hand, never utter an impolite word. Even the Anatolian Gypsies of Balat are upright citizens compared to these Rumelian Gypsies; I have given an account of their language above in Volume (—).62

These Gypsies too have twelve dialects, one uglier than the next – may God save His servants from their wickedness. But the world traveller must have some inkling of their dialects as well, and so I have recorded it here despite the impropriety of some expressions. Don’t blame me; for these Gypsies made my liver bloody and my eyes red with tears.

62 This is not found in the Book of Travels as we now have it.





4. Athens





Description of the great ancient city, the abode of sages, the walled town of Athens


We say Atina, but the Greeks say Athina, since t and th are very close in pronunciation. It means (—). In Latin it is called (—), in French (—), in Italian (—), in (—) (—).

All the Christian and Coptic chroniclers agree that the founder of Athens was the prophet Solomon. He had the fairies bring Balqis, the daughter of the king of Sheba, to him one night in her dressing gown and he married her. Balqis wanted to see the world, so Solomon commanded the wind to transport them. Flying from Jerusalem they landed first on the summit of Mt Sfakia, on the island of Crete, where Balqis built a lofty pavilion. Their next stop was this city of Athens where, in the place called Temaşalık (‘Promenade’), they built a palace like the garden of the many--columned city of Iram (89:7).

Solomon’s son, King Rehoboam, further developed the city, and after him King Feylekos (Philip), in the fifth generation after Solomon. He also founded Salonica and Kavala, and subjugated the Greeks and Arabs and Persians. It was during his reign that Alexander the Great came into the world. Feylekos raised Alexander who became the world-adorning emperor Dhu’l-qarnayn. Alexander embellished this city of Athens even further.

7,000 Greek philosophers and physicians forgathered here, which is why the chroniclers of all nations refer to it as the abode of sages. They include Pythagoras the Monotheist, Hippocrates, Socrates, Feylekos (Philip), Feylesof (‘Philosopher’), Aristotle, Galen, Plato the Divine, Ptolemy, etc.

In short, all the wise men liked the Athenian climate and took up residence. They collaborated trying to find a cure for death, and although unsuccessful, they did find cures for myriads of illnesses – largely through diet and exercise – and each of them lived three or four hundred years. Hippocrates the physician not only found no cure for death, he eventually succumbed to his own illness and died of dysentery. Plato the Divine died shortly thereafter, so the philosophers abandoned his religion and adopted that of the prophet (—) (—).

Plato the Divine, in his travels, came to Pécs on the frontier of Buda where he resided for forty years. Finally he too … despite his perfect intellect, gave the collar of his life into the hands of death. He is buried in a garden outside the Szeged Gate of Pécs. His last words were: ‘O Athens, my garden of paradise!’

And what a goodly and prosperous city it was – lofty in construction, mighty in population, full of marvels and wonders and fine arts and crafts. Visitors are amazed at its architectural monuments carved out of white marble. Their eyes are dazzled at its marvellous paintings and statues, in the Frankish manner. The figures in the paintings seem to be alive, and the statues smile or frown or look askance.

In sum, nowhere on the face of the earth in all the seven climes are there such noteworthy wonders and sight-worthy marvels as this city of mild climate and ancient entrepôt of Athens and its surroundings, including the valley of Temaşalık, the ports of Ejder (Dragon – i.e. Piraeus) and Derzi (Tailor), the church of Koçbaşı (Ram’s-head), the town of Kifse, and Mermerlik (Marble-quarry).

The Greek people originated in the time of the prophet David and, multiplying in the country of Greece and acquiring property and territory, first built the great city of Macedonia which is Filibe; then the city of Pozanta (Byzantium) which was latter called Kostantiniye (Constantinople) and now is called Islambol (‘Islam-plenty’ – i.e., Istanbul). Then they built this city of Athens on the Rumelia side of the Sea of Rum (i.e., the Aegean) at the end of the Gulf (of Corinth) to the north and west.

Later Constantine, the ruler of Istanbul, expanded and embellished it. His army ruled over this city of Athens, which already had a 1,700 year history as a great entrepôt and a medrese (!) and abode of philosophers. It passed from king to king and emperor to emperor, eventually passing from the hands of Spain to the Venetian Franks and then, in the year (—), being conquered by the Ottomans in the person of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror.

Now Athens is in the province of Rumeli, under the governance of the Admiral, in the sancak of (—), an endowment of Mecca and Medina under the supervision of the chief black eunuch, ‘cut off from the pen and separate from the foot,’ an imperial has. The Sharia administration is headed by a kadi with salary of 300 akçe per diem and with (—) villages under his jurisdiction. There are also a mufti; a marshal of the descendants of the Prophet; a colonel of the cavalry troops; and a commander of the janissaries. The governor’s salary, paid by the chief black eunuch, is 50,000 guruş. Other officers are the castle warden with his 150-man garrison, market supervisor, toll-collector, tax-agent, municipal deputy, chief architect, and chief of police. The Greek Orthodox community have a patriarch, no other magistrate.





Fortifications. The walled city (Acropolis) is in the middle of a broad plain, on a sheer red rock, unthreatened by higher ground. It is a very ancient construction in an oval shape elongated from east to west. No other place on earth has such a mighty fortress, because the rock towers up 100 cubits from the ground. The stones of the fortification are dressed white marble, polished and shining, each one the size of an elephant or a bathhouse dome. The master builders of old expended great effort to fit these stones together without using lime or mortar. No foe could gain victory over this castle, since it is impossible to dig siege trenches or to undermine the wall from any direction, and there is no higher ground looming above it.

The stone construction above the native rock is 50 cubits in height. The castle’s circumference measured on the outer wall is 3,000 paces. There is no moat, as every side is a sheer rock chasm like the Ghayya pit of hell. There are three iron gates that give on to one another, the layers separated by fifty paces, only facing westward.

Within the wall are 300 castle-like houses, built of stone and completely covered with roof tiles. While they have no gardens, they do have windows and balconies with fine views of the vineyards and fields and gardens in the plain. In the time of the infidels, water flowed into the castle through subterranean channels, but no longer. Now all the houses have cisterns that catch rain water from the roofs. So there is ice-cold water even in July, but the amount depends on the rain. Many people get their drinking water from wells in the suburb below, hauled up by donkeys.





Mosques. There is one Friday mosque in the walled city (the Parthenon). It is a remarkable light-filled mosque, situated in the middle of this castle, and very famous among world-travellers. It is 250 feet long and 80 feet wide, and contains sixty tall and well-proportioned columns of white marble, laid out in two rows one above the other.

On every side of the mosque, above the columns, another gallery has been built, so all around there are two layers of well-constructed mosques. But four of the columns, between the prayer-niche and the pulpit, are lofty piers of red porphyry, marvels of God’s creation, so shiny that they reflect one’s face, each one worth the revenue of an entire clime.

Above these columns, where the qibla is located, is a lofty gold-embellished enamelled dome of aloes wood, like a paper cutout of Fahri, amazing to behold. Plato the Divine used to hang a lamp made of carbuncle in this dome constructed of aloes wood. On the eastern wall of the mosque he put paper-thin slabs of harekan marble, otherwise known as fire-stones. As the sun rose, those stones turned red-hot from the heat of the sun, igniting naphtha-soaked wicks that lit the carbuncle lamps and illuminated the interior of the mosque. The infidels revered this mechanism as a talisman, calling it Lamp of Divine Light.

In the year (—), during the reign of the Umayyads, Sultan Mansur came from the Maghreb with 1,000 ships and conquered the islands of Crete and Sicily, and also conquered this walled town of Athens. He took away the above-mentioned carbuncle lamps and the chains of jewels and thousands of precious idols and candlesticks and jewel-encrusted crosses. But they did not know that the enamelled dome was made of aloes wood and so did not take that. Even now no one knows about it. But it is a noteworthy enamelled dome, truly a wonder.

Now as well, next to our (!) pulpit are four emerald-like porphyry columns, in which one observes strange multicoloured shapes and wondrous flowers. Aside from the eight porphyry columns – the aforementioned four red ones and these four green ones – all of the sixty white-marble columns, rising one or two storeys high inside the mosque, are fluted and grooved.

Just to the left of the four green porphyry columns are six slender columnettes of white marble upon which the master carver has made a white-marble throne for Plato the Divine that dazzles the eye and amazes the mind of anyone trained in the science of architecture. Above the six columnettes are six highly-wrought little arches, all rising to a point where there is a small dome. Plato the Divine used to sit on that dome and harangue the people. It is surrounded by an intricate network of carved marble ornament. In the very centre of that small dome, where the little arches come together, a head of cheese has been carved out of white marble resembling a belly63 – a magical work of art. And the central part of this throne is surrounded by a carved grating of cypress wood.



This mosque is completely paved with slabs of white marble, each one five cubits square and so wavy (i.e., polished?) that one’s face is reflected in it.

The gate of this mosque, in three layers, is on the qibla side. As one enters, between the outer and middle gate on the left-hand side is a goblet carved from striated white marble, large enough for a man to fit inside. In olden days the building contractor used to offer wine in that goblet to the workers in the mosque, and they would drink it in one gulp. Nowadays it would require two waterskins borne by water carriers and their horses to fill that goblet. What tall and sturdy men those men of old must have been to drink that amount of wine without pausing for a breath. Now another stone-carver has hollowed it out further and attached a spigot, so it serves for ablutions.

The hall ceiling of the middle gate is delicately carved work, like a cutout of Fahri Çelebi of Bursa, with pure gilding. The door leaves are 20 cubits high and made of cypress wood. Formerly, in the time of the infidels, these gates were covered with gold and encrusted with jewels; the settings for the jewels are still quite visible.

Passing the inner gate, you are inside the mosque. The enclosure where the organ and bells would be played has arches with, in the middle, a hanging arch called an orphan arch, and over another arch is a hanging column. This is really worth seeing, but when you see it you still cannot comprehend it but must marvel with finger to mouth. The proper response is silence before something miraculous. Above this arch and column is a carbuncle shining so brightly that by its light the priests were able to read the Gospel and other scriptures on a dark night.

But this ancient temple, the upper part of the mosque, has no stone-built dome. According to Muhammad ibn Ishaq (biographer of the Prophet, d. 768), the Prophet Muhammad was born 600 years after Jesus. On the night of his birth, the Vault of Chosroes in Iraq collapsed, the fire temple of Nimrod was extinguished, and the domes of Ayasofya in Pozanta (Hagia Sofia in Byzantium, i.e., Istanbul), of Ayasofya in Salonica, and of this Athens cathedral were all destroyed. The Athens dome was subsequently rebuilt several times but never stayed firmly in place. So the king of Istanbul (i.e., the Byzantine emperor) had great arches constructed where the dome used to be, then had planks of cypress laid down over the arches and, above these, cypress columns topped by a cypress wood ceiling. All the wood was embellished with gold and coloured paintings of a quality surpassing that of Mani and Bihzad, and the fragrance of cypress perfumed the brains of the large congregation.

These painted cypress planks are roofed over by lime and gypsum and a layer of white marble, rather than a lead-covered dome. Every marble slab is the size of a knotted rug or kilim. The marble is finer and shinier than lead, and sparkles in the sun like cut glass. The master stone-carver has sliced this marble roofing as thin as ceiling boards, so it does not weigh heavily on the building’s foundation.

When rain falls on these marble roof-tiles it runs off, by cunningly incised channels, into a cistern that is built on six tall columns resting on a large stone terrace reached by six stone steps from the prayer-niche hall on the qibla side of the mosque. All the rain that flows from the marble slabs on top of the mosque gathers in this cistern beneath the prayer-niche. So there is plenty of fresh cold water for the thirsty congregants.

On top of this qibla hall where the cistern is located there is a stone structure with a half dome – not a dome constructed with wooden beams as the interior of the mosque. This half dome is also roofed over with white marble slabs the size of kilims. The inside of this enamelled dome is glassy (?) stone covered with gilding and embellished with blue and red paint.

I examined this qibla dome very closely both inside and outside. It is overlaid with varicoloured marble and precious stones. And the arches and walls have variegated beads and small precious stones – white, black, red and other colours – dazzling to behold, recalling the mosaics of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

As for the lofty red and green columns, their like is found nowhere on earth except in the Ayasofya and Süleymaniye mosques in Istanbul.

The tongue falls short in describing the prayer-niche and pulpit.

The shiny marble slabs on the walls of this mosque are each the size of an elephant. The strange thing is that even a master architect cannot detect the places where these slabs are joined – it is as though the entire wall, 40 cubits high, were a single slab. And the wall is so shiny that the slightest speck of dust is visible. In particular, the faces and kneelings and prostrations of the worshippers – God save them! – are all reflected in the surrounding walls as though in a mirror.

Another admirable feature about these walls is that no mortar or lime or gypsum was used in their construction. The entire mosque was built using lead and iron clamps, nothing else.

As for the sixty remarkable lofty fluted columns of the outer courtyard, they are each twenty-five cubits tall. Unlike the columns inside the mosque, however, they are not carved out of single blocks of marble. Still, no matter how closely you examine them, you cannot see where the pieces are joined and you would say they are each made of a single block. The reason is the grooves and flutings which the master stone-carver made in highly-wrought ancient style. These sixty columns are laid out like cypresses around the courtyard in measured rows according to the science of geometry.

Above the columns, which are sheltered by eaves, and above the walls are a remarkable and varied assembly of voluminous statues, made of white marble. If I were to describe these one by one, it would require an entire volume and would hinder the course of our travels. The human mind cannot indeed comprehend these images – they are white magic, beyond human capacity. One with the intellect of Aristotle would be dumbfounded at the sight of these statues and proclaim them a miracle, because to a discerning eye they seem to be alive.

In sum, whatever living creatures the Lord Creator has created, from Adam to the Resurrection, are depicted in these marble statues around the courtyard of the mosque. Fearful and ugly demons, jinns, Satan the Whisperer, the Sneak, the Farter; fairies, angels, dragons, earth-beasts (cf. 27:82); the angels that bear up the throne of God and the ox that bears up the earth; sea-beasts, elephants, rhinoceri, giraffes, horned vipers, snakes, centipedes, scorpions, tortoises, crocodiles, sea-sprites; thousands of mice, cats, lions, leopards, tigers, cheetahs, lynxes; ghouls, cherubs, Gabriel, Israfil, Azrael, Michael; the Throne, the Bridge, the Scales; and all creatures that will arise in the plain of resurrection and be assigned their places – those in the fires of hell depicted grieving and mourning and tormented by serpents and demons; and those in the gardens of paradise depicted in marble enjoying the pleasures of the houris and gılman (male denizens of paradise). In short, one who sees the depiction of paradise on these walls of the mosque’s courtyard will be delighted, while one who sees the frightful and monstrous likenesses of the people in hell will be petrified and aghast.

If you do not travel to Athens yourself and see it with your own eyes, you can have no idea what it was like in ancient times. Description cannot do it justice and, as the verse has it, How can hearing measure up to seeing? It has been this humble one’s pleasure to roam the seven climes of the inhabited world ever since the year 1050 (1640–1). But I have nowhere seen such marvels as in this city of Athens – as well as Rome (!) in the land of the Franks and Esztergom in Hungary and Vienna and Amsterdam in Holland. But the artistry displayed in this Athens mosque and in the courtyard is more wondrous and marvellous than in those countries. Anyone who has not seen this city should simply not call himself a world-traveller.

But when that terrible Sultan of the West, King Mansur, conquered this province, he gouged out the jewel-eyes of all the statues and ‘blinded’ them. He plundered all of the precious bejewelled lamps and candlesticks and carbuncles and crucifixes. He removed the rubies from the domes in the outer courtyard and set fire to the courtyard – some places are still shrivelled from the depredation of that fire. Still, there is not such a resplendent mosque anywhere else on earth; because no matter how many times you enter it, you will always discover some new example of artistry and workmanship. The verse:

We have seen all the mosques of the world,



But we have never seen the likes of this!





must be about this light-filled mosque, for there is nothing like this place of worship in all the inhabited part of the earth – may it remain firm on its foundations until the end of time. Amen, O Helper of men!





On a building of wonders. Below this mosque, just inside the castle gate, are the classrooms of the physicians and philosophers. The windows, set in the walls, are of fine white marble. After the conquest, the Ottomans stored their gunpowder in this school and made it an armoury. One day, by God’s wisdom, it was struck by lightning and some parts of it were destroyed. It is now used as a caravanserai. This large building is also a marvellous sight, beyond description.

Nearby, between the two fortress gates, is the gun foundry, where there are a few large cannons. There is also a small prayer-hall used by the armed garrison troops who patrol the castle gate.

A hundred paces below this gate is the dervish convent of Hüseyn Efendi. It is a great shrine of the Halveti Sufi order. Above the door is the chronogram:

Mahdemi uttered its date as follows:



May that hero be acceptable to God.



Year 1023 (1614)





The suburb of Athens. A lovely unwalled town, like the Garden of Meram (in Konya), situated to the north and north-east of the walled city. There are three Muslim quarters, the houses all clumped together in one place.

There are three Friday mosques – four prayer-niches altogether if you count the mosque in the citadel, described above. One is the (—) Bey mosque, built of stone with a dome, solid and thriving. The others are the Hacı Ali mosque and the Old Mosque. All three are built of stone and have domes with tiled roofs – none of the buildings in this city have lead roofs.

There are seven neighbourhood mosques; one medrese; three primary schools; two dervish convents; three baths – Bey Hammam, Hacı Ali Hammam, Abid Efendi Hammam – all with pleasant atmosphere; and two merchant hans. And there are a total of 105 shops. While there is no bedestan, still every kind of precious stuff and valuable merchandise can be found.

There are 7,000 tile-roofed houses, of both Muslims and Christians. They are sturdy houses, like castles with battlements and loopholes, and built completely of stone – there are no wooden houses or houses with earthen roofs or mud-brick walls, but only splendid houses with stone walls set with mortar and lime. Each house has a cistern into which rain water is channelled from the roof. In short, they are very solid and spacious houses, most having gardens and entertaining guests.

The streets are pure sandy ground. There are no pavements, since there is never mud in this city.

The number of infidels registered to pay the harac tax is 4,000, although the true number is over 10,000. It is very much like the city of Malta. Muslims here are a despised group, with no standing or dignity, because the Christians are great merchants who have business partners in Western Europe (Dip Frengistan).





Dress of the infidels of Athens. The older men and the magistrates wear Eflatuniye hats of black silk velvet and garments of black mohair. The Greek youths wear red fezzes, varicoloured broadcloth vests, magnificent silk waistbands of various colours and silk belts, and, on their feet, black boots or black or red slippers.

The women wear varicoloured dresses and tarbooshes on their heads and go about with their faces uncovered. But no one in this city has ever seen a woman, whether Muslim or Christian, go out into the marketplace during the day. At night it is another story. As soon as it is dark, thousands of women grab their lanterns and go to other houses, or to the baths, where they party until morning – as in the verse:

That is to say, I search for you from house to house.





There is one class of women that wear something quite strange on their heads: a flat headgear that is pied like a peacock’s tail. It is a marvellous getup. But the Christian peasants wear the kamelaukion (manlifke) – like the Frankish conical felt cap – and varicoloured woolen or felt cloaks.





Dispraise of the churches. There are a total of 300 houses of idol-worship, and 3,000 priests and monks.





Water fountains. In the time of the infidels there were fountains in 108 places and every house had flowing water. Now the roads are in ruins and one can make out where the fountains used to be.





Wells. In the houses are 4,000 wells.





The pleasure-dome of Balqis. The eastern side of this city of Athens is known as the Throne of Balqis (the Queen of Sheba). It was made by demons at the command of the prophet Solomon. I would require an entire quire to describe this as it deserves, with its variegated columns and vaults of Chosroes and lofty domes. These days it serves as the public prayer-grounds of Athens. All the Muslims of the city resort to it, fully armed, for the prayer for rain and for the two festivals; because there are hardly any Muslims left – the city has been left to the infidels. It is a sight worth seeing, an open-air prayer-ground palace with soaring columns in praise of which the tongue falls short.

There is another large palace in the city, in the place known as the Scala Gate – an ancient and splendid palace, beyond description, a sightseeing must.

Then, in the place known as (—), a magical site known as Uzun Kenise (‘Long Church’), impossible to describe.





A wondrous building (Tower of the Winds). Near the Old Mosque there is a gathering-place of learned men known as Plato’s Pavilion. It consists of a remarkable sort of stone tent with eight sides facing the eight winds, each side formed from a single slab. On each of the sides of this pavilion a human figure is depicted, carved from a single slab of white marble. Each figure holds in his hands the characteristic implements of one of the winds. Four of the winds are depicted as male and four as female. The four males are shown with the moon-like features of a youth bright as the sun’s rays, and the four females are portrayed as lovely women. The winds depicted as men are Northwest, North, Northeast and East, and the women are Southwest, West, South and Southeast. In truth it was the magic art that made these images so that each one stands facing one of the winds.

The dome of the pavilion is formed of white marble inside, and the twelve segments of the dome are laid out according to the twelve constellations of the zodiac. In one segment is depicted the constellation of Ares, the mansion of Mars, retrograde, fiery. In another is Taurus, the mansion of Venus, earthy. In another is Gemini, the mansion of Mercury, airy. In another is Cancer, the mansion of the Moon, watery. In another is Leo, the mansion of the Sun, fiery. In another is Virgo, the mansion of Mercury, earthy. In another is Libra, the mansion of Venus, airy. In another is Scorpio, the mansion of Mars, watery. In another is Sagittarius, the mansion of Jupiter, fiery. In another is Capricorn, the mansion of Saturn, earthy. In another is Aquarius, the mansion of Saturn, airy. In the twelfth segment is Pisces, the mansion of Jupiter, watery. Thus the seven planets relating to these constellations and the influences of the other stars are depicted. It is a unitary, instructional pavilion of well-wrought marble in twelve segments, at the level of manifest magic.

Inside this pavilion-shaped dome there is a tomb in which all the Christian infidels believe that Philip the Greek is buried, and on their infamous feast days they visit it. At the head and foot of this grave a chronogram has been written in the Greek language.

Atop this marble pavilion-dome is a thin stylus. They say that in the days of the learned ancients a world-mirror, like the mirror of Alexander (on the Pharos), was set on this stylus. Whenever an enemy started out against this city from any direction, the army and its commander were revealed in this world-mirror. Its perch remains, but the mirror is no longer there.

In those days also, each of the learned men in the city devised for it a different sort of wonderful talisman and marvellous charm. And so this city never had plagues, snakes, centipedes, scorpions, storks, crows, fleas, lice, bedbugs, mosquitoes or houseflies. The year has 366 days, and there were two talismans set on the seashore for each day, one toward the land and one toward the sea. These were operative until the day when the Prophet emerged from his mother’s womb. On the night of the birth of the Beloved of God, all the talismans and charms were turned upside-down and their effect was nullified. Even now I have seen many places where the talismans used to be, and even now the city of Athens has no mosquitoes, centipedes, storks or crows – if they do come they do not settle down, and if they stay for long they die.

If an ill man goes inside this pavilion-dome, he immediately feels nauseated and vomits up black and yellow bile and phlegm and other humours. That is because in one of the segments of the dome there is a piece of Yemeni alum, and in another there is a blue vitriol eye-stone (or copper sulphate). Anyone with fever who goes inside is affected by their fumes; once he has vomited he is cured of his fever. This is a well-tested remedy.

One of the learned men, an accomplished master, contrived a time-piece, based on astronomical calculation and the astrolabe, corresponding to the eight winds on the outside of this pavilion-dome. It consists of a quadrant, together with slanting lines of celestial declination, carved into the marble. Never in this devious firmament has such a finely-wrought time-piece been made, whether by one of the Ptolemies, or by al-Hakim Bi-Amrillah (Fatimid caliph, reg. 996–1021), or by Ali Kuşçu in the days of Mehmed the Conqueror.

In sum, it is a marvellous lofty dome.

At the bottom of the cliff that looms over (!) this Athens castle are caves with all sorts of domes and palaces and hermit’s cells. All the ancient sages – Aristotle, Hippocrates, Socrates, Pythagoras the Monotheist, Galen, Feylekos, Feylesof, Ptolemy, Mihan (?), Michael, and Plato – had cells in these caves. If you go inside them your brain will be perfumed by the fragrance of nutmeg, cubeb, cinnamon, long pepper, ginger, aloes, pellitory and cardamon. Since some of these cavemen practised alchemy, you can also smell sulphur and mercury and arsenic.

In those days, the philosophers who came to this city took up residence in these caves where they taught classes and held learned discussions. They knew all the occult sciences and perfected all branches of knowledge. That is why some chroniclers of old call Athens the City of Illuminationists (i.e., Pythagoreans), the City of Walkers (i.e., Peripatetics) and the City of (—). There were philosophers then who day and night were in wordless communication with the philosophers of Baghdad (i.e., Babylon). It is quite a mystery how scholars in Baghdad and Athens could commune with each other, the two cities being a five-month’s journey apart; indeed, it is a miracle on the level of Jesus’s life-giving breath.

Athens at that time was so populous and prosperous that the entire way between it and the port of Ejder, which is two hours south of the city, was lined with layer on layer of palaces and gardens and shops and tourist attractions. Hundreds of these are still visible. Two hours in another direction is Mt Deli (‘Crazy’). And to the north is the town of Kifse, which now is separated from Athens by thousands of vineyards. In short, it would take a man three days to go around this city by foot; and a letter could be passed from hand to hand and be delivered in Eğriboz or İstife or Corinth. These days the area between the city and Port Ejder is filled with vineyards and flower gardens and vegetable gardens; but there are myriads of ruined buildings with their domes and arches.





The wondrous building of Port Ejder (Piraeus). Two hours south of the city, at the end of a gulf of the Aegean Sea, is Port Ejder, known to sailors and merchants from sea to sea.

On the quay, at the foot of a great han, is the statue of a lion, the height of two men, made of white marble. It is sitting on its hind quarters and its mouth is open toward the sea, i.e. toward the south. The master stone-carver has crafted such a likeness that all the world’s painters could not equal it. The lion’s head is the size of a bathhouse dome. The two front paws are resting on the shore and the lion is squatting on its hind quarters and gazing out to sea as though watching the ships. It is because this huge lion resembles a fearsome dragon that this place is called Port Ejder (‘Dragon’). This is another wondrous work of art.

This great gated harbour is circular, shaped like a bowl, and can hold 300 ships at anchor, safe from the five winds. When Canpoladzade Mustafa Pasha was admiral (1630–2), he anchored here with the imperial fleet and built a breakwater and a large tower at the mouth of the harbour. During that time he also went to observe this lion and decided to paint it in various colours. Traces of that paint are still visible on the lion’s body. Then Sultan Murad IV summoned Canpoladzade Mustafa Pasha to the Porte and he left the breakwater tower incomplete. Were it to be completed, this Port Ejder would indeed become a dragon’s lair and a safe harbour. The only drawback is that there is no fresh water anywhere along the harbour shore. But there are streams of fresh water in the nearby vineyards.

This humble one took a close look at the lion statue and concluded that in the time of the infidels it must have served as a fountain. It is sitting on its hind quarters and has its mouth open to the air, and the space in front of its front paws is a large pool. Hence it must have been used as a fountain. Water spurted from its mouth as thick as a man’s torso and poured into the pool. The mariners got their fresh water from there. The source was a lofty mountain two hours east of Athens known as Mt Deli. The water was brought from there by pipes and made to flow out of this lion statue’s mouth. There are still traces of that water course.64

Explanation of the Greek language. This verse, in the Gospel, was revealed concerning the coming of the Prophet Muhammad: abitun a boy azeriyun a son of Azar porfonoton will be the prophet lev gıslin he will not be a liar nithu nitha his birth efzulad will be in Mecca ki kalevşir he will have come with righteousness to nomnin his blessed name mevamith u mith will be Ahmad Muhammad epsigodos those who follow him na kirdis will possess this world biystu bith and will possess the other world.

Names of Jesus’s apostles: Simyon, Pavlo, Petro, Anderya; Yovani – as the Gospel was revealed verse by verse this Yovani gathered them into a book; Manthego; Luka – he was an ecstatic, privy to divine mysteries; Marko – the Venetian Franks call him San Marko and the lion depicted on their flags and banners is his image; Yakopi – he is Jacob; Thoma. Two are unknown. After the ascension of Jesus – whom We raised to a high position (19:57) – each of these disciples journeyed to a different region and made known the religion of Jesus. They made the Roman (or Byzantine) lands prosper and assembled in the ancient cities of Athens and Rome.

As for those who came after these disciples, the Greeks call them Aya Niko, Aya Yoro, Aya Kasim, Aya Vestos, Aya Hıdrellez, and Aya İsvet Nikola. Aya means saint and kala yoroz means great priest.

In sum, this language of the Greeks is like an ocean, but we have only dared to record this much.

63 This is the reading the text requires (Ol kubbeciğin ta ortasında göbek gibi bir beyaz mermerden bir kelle peynir tasvir olunmuşdur). Thanks to Pierre MacKay who provides the following explanation:

This is a description of the pulpit, or ambo, off to one side of the main aisle. The builders may have copied an omphalos, one of the commonest ornaments of classical Greek architecture – the most famous one is at Delphi – and one that properly belongs in the middle of something. I imagine Evliya asking, ‘What is that called?’ and on being told that it was an omphalos, looking at it in some bewilderment. The shape of an omphalos is the pointy half of a hard-boiled egg or an old-fashioned sugar-loaf. It is often decorated with vines, etc. I would guess that it didn’t look like any navel in Evliya’s experience, so he felt he had to describe it to his readers, and resorted to a cake of cheese, called ‘a head of cheese’ in Turkish (Rd1, 1564).

5. Balibadra: A great cypress tree and the five ethnic groups of the Morea





A huge cypress. In the seven climes and the inhabited quarter of the earth there is nothing like it, for God the Creator and Fashioner, the Eternal Gardener, has fixed His glance upon it. It is an emerald-like green cypress but, unlike other cypresses, it is not straight and tall; rather, it has four forks and 360 branches shooting left and right and upward. Forty or fifty strings of horses can be tied to it, and 40,000 or 50,000 thousand sheep can rest in its shade. Each of its branches would encompass fifty or sixty spans. I and my seven slaveboys holding hands could hardly embrace its main trunk – one of them had to remove his turban and holding the ends of the unravelled turban-cloth we were just able to encircle it.

At the very summit of this noteworthy cypress is an ancient cavity where honeybees have made their hive. Every year in the honey season the owner of this cypress climbs up and extracts 100 okkas of honey which he sends to various provinces as gifts for the great notables. As God is my witness, there is no honey on earth more fragrant than this. All the Frankish chroniclers agree that it is because of the world-famous honey (bal) derived from this 3,060-year-old cypress that this city has received the name Balibadra.

During the time of Azaryun, the father of Abraham, a group of infidels adopted this cypress as a god – God forbid! – and worshipped it. To this very day, whenever any member of the Christian religious community passes by this cypress, he removes his hat and bows his bare head to it several times. I have witnessed this myself, since I got hoisted up with slings to one of the branches of this cypress in order to leave behind a monument of myself in this pleasure-park as well. I took my penknife and carved out of the bark the following graffito in the Karahisari manner: For the spirit of the world-traveller Evliya, a Fatiha (Seyyah-ı alem Evliya ruhiyçün el-fatiha). This graffito was even finer than the one I carved out of the lofty plain tree on the island of Cos. God willing, it will last forever.

The climate in this city is rather unpleasant, since it is on the coast. Lemons, oranges and other fruit-bearing trees are not bad. Also, there are quite a few streams of fresh water here and there.

The people are Rumyor: they speak Greek (Rumca) and the populace are Greek (Urum) and Albanian infidels. To be precise, the Morea (i.e. Peloponnesus) is a peninsula 770 miles in circumference and contains five distinct ethnic groups:

First are the native Muslim believers and monotheists of the Morea. Their language is Greekish (Urumşa).

The populace of the Kalavrata, Vostiçse and Taraboliçse regions as far as Corinth are Albanians and they all speak Albanian.

In Benefşe (Monemvasia) and Anabolı and the Maina mountains live a distinct group known as Çakona (Tsakonians). Their language is neither Greek nor Italian but a strange dialect peculiar to themselves and requiring an interpreter to understand.

The Maina province is at the southern promontory of the Morea peninsula, opposite Crete. The language of the Maina infidels is also neither Greek nor Katofari (?), but a dialect with its own nasty expressions.

Finally there are the infidels of Mistra. They are Greeks whose speech is very elegant and eloquent.

Each of the five groups has its distinct terms and expressions which will be recorded in their proper place.

Here in Ballıbadra there are also many Jews, since all the customs officials and the brokers in the marketplace are Jews, as are the sentries on all the Frankish galleons in the harbour.





6. Siege of Candia: Ministrations to the wounded and Saint Green-Arm





This humble one, full of fault, acquired some courage from constantly witnessing these great battles. Day and night I girded my loins and recited the Muhammadan call-to-prayer, or I tended to the Muslim gazis who had entered the thick of battle with bloody hands and bloody sword, with burning heart and naked breast, and with the words of the holy Koran on their lips. God be praised, whenever God saved one of them from a mine or a stone or a bomb, or from the projectile of a cannon or a musket, I was ready with weapons or with ablutions. I buried several hundred martyrs, including some governors and commanders, and several hundred others who were wounded I brought to the surgeons to be tended. Indeed, I can say in all sincerity that this poor and humble one sometimes carried bread and soup to the wounded. For some, who were poor, I and my servants boiled and washed their clothes and re-dressed them, soothing their wounded hearts and pitying their tears. For others, whose beards and moustaches and ears were swarming with lice, I used my scissors to snip their hair, turning them into ‘four-stroke’ Kalenderi dervishes (i.e. who have shaved off all facial hair), and thus saved quite a few patients from lice. There were times when all hell broke loose, when father ignored son and son ignored father. Even then I would fill my little waterskin-of-the-poor with Water of Life and dole it out to the sick and wounded left behind in the old trenches without attendants and without the strength to move. So I gladdened the spirits of the martyrs in the Plain of Karbala and gladdened the grieving hearts of the wounded. May the Almighty not record this as hypocrisy, may it be found acceptable in the divine court.





Deeds of the saints, by God’s wisdom. In the year 1079 on the Night of Berat,65 in the middle of the night, as the night-watch of the grand vizier’s regiment was stationed at the seashore, a fire appeared over the water about ten miles off the coast. All the Muslim gazis in the trenches saw it. ‘Help!’ they cried. ‘The infidels have devised some trick to attack the trenches. Gazis, don’t pay attention to that fire, just stand firm in your trenches and stay alert.’ But they did station all the berserkers and the irregulars at the seashore and directed them to monitor any fires of the infidels coming deceptively from the sea. So a few thousand gazis stood ready on the shore. By God’s wisdom, that fire was surging toward the shore on the waves. As it approached, myriads of muskets and cannons were directed against it and the sea was roiled with lead like bulgur boiling in a pot of water. The fire got brighter and brighter, with flames shooting toward the sky. The army camp in that dark night was lit up like day. The gazis kept pumping lead into the fire as the waves drove it ashore. Then what should they see? Onto the shore emerged the corpse of a man, completely naked except that his genitals were concealed within a thick purse-like sack. Some of the braver soldiers, paying no heed to the flames that were emanating from his (right) hand, ripped open the sack-cloth and looked at his genitals. When they saw that he was circumcised according to the Prophetic Sunna, they knew that he was a Muslim martyr. The dead man raised his left hand and covered his genitals, at which some cried ‘God be praised!’ while others warned that it was a fire-trick of the infidels who had put a magical spell on a Muslim’s dead body. Amidst a jangle of rumours and contrary opinions they brought the blessed corpse onto the shore. Now they saw that his right arm was completely green, and from a hole in the hollow of the hand, green and blue and red flames were streaming forth. Light emanated from the skin, which was pure as crystal and unscathed by the countless bullets and cannonballs that had been shot at it. The fire emerging from the hollow of the hand turned out to be light as well, shining up to the sky. When the Muslim gazis observed this they realised that he was truly a noble martyr. The grand vizier’s deputy, Mahmud Agha, and the other commanders obtained fatwas from the grand mufti of the army. By vizierial command they informed this humble one, full of fault. I veiled his face, resplendent as the full moon, with my cloak and covered his pure body with an ihram (seamless white pilgrim’s garb used as a shroud). In the morning, the multicoloured lights in his arm disappeared; only a faint light glowed like fire in the hollow of his palm. After the dawn prayer I gathered round me a few hundred dervishes. As we recited our litanies we lifted the noble corpse from the shore on a kilim and conducted it to our graveyard called Kara Şehidlik (‘Black Martyrs’ Cemetery’). During our procession, shrouds sprinkled with Zamzam water came from thirteen places. This humble one washed the corpse. Along with several myriads of soldiers we performed the interment prayer and buried the corpse in that dervish cemetery. I dubbed him Yeşil Kollu Sultan (‘Saint Green-Arm’), had a moat dug out and a stone structure built around his grave, and over the tombstone placed a wooden banner painted green, the symbol of martyrs. It has become a popular pilgrimage site – may God have mercy on him.

Subsequently, for love of God, I washed and buried my travel companion in seven kingdoms and three sultanates, Hindi Baba Mansur; also Karabaş Yunus Dede and another dervish sheikh named Tofu; quite a few dervishes; two of my slaveboys who were martyred during the siege; three pashas – Kara Mustafa Pasha, Katırcızade Mehmed Pasha and Vanlı Mehmed Pasha; several sancak-beys; and other notables and commoners. For the spirits of all the martyrs of the Plain of Karbala, and the martyrs of the Battle of Siffin, and the martyrs of the gaza of Candia – may God be pleased with them – a Fatiha!

And there were many other tasks and efforts that I accomplished – may the Almighty not record this as hypocrisy. I shot more than 3,000 arrows. I shot two and a half years’ worth of bullets. I carried hundreds of loads of earth. I recited the Koran night and day over two and a half years, completing one Koran recital every Friday eve (Thursday night). And wherever I found a stray cannonball I carried it to the foot of the cannons. May God Most High find these tasks acceptable in His court.

65 The sacred night between the 14th and the 15th of the month Sha‘ban, corresponding to 30 January 1668.





7. A captive woman in Kolorya





As we were going about on horseback, I saw a pretty young woman sitting under an olive tree. Her head was covered with a green cloth, and in her arms was a baby, also wrapped in a green cloth. When we approached, she stood up, put the baby down on the ground, and with a Greek accent cried: ‘O my dear Evliya Çelebi!’ She caught hold of my horse’s stirrup and wept bitterly.

I was moved with pity, but also taken aback. ‘Woman,’ I said, ‘how in this land of infidels did you know I was Evliya Çelebi?’

‘Don’t you recognise me?’ she said. ‘I am Saime, daughter of the captain of Bardunya, Emir Hasan Agha. Don’t you remember how much time you spent eating my father’s bread and salt when you and your retinue stayed in our house? It is seven years now that I have been a captive.’ She kept weeping, as she took up her baby again into her arms.

‘Girl,’ I cried, ‘hurry, mount one of my slaveboy’s horses, and let’s be off. I’ll return you this very day to your father and mother.’

‘O no, my dear little Çelebi,’ replied the hussy. ‘This little baby in my arms belongs to my Captain Lemberaki. I also go to church with my husband. I don’t want to have anything to do with the Emir.’ She moved off quite a bit, then smiled and said: ‘Go in health.’

It occurred to me that I ought to kill this cursed woman before I left. ‘Come girl,’ I said, ‘let me take you to your father, my friend Hasan Agha.’ As I rode up to her she ran off to her house, went inside, and locked the door behind her.

This province of Maina has thousands of such Muslim captives. God be praised, this humble servant has rescued 170 Muslims from captivity in the course of my travels. I know, of course, that many thousands have been sent off to the lands of the infidels, and that hundreds are wasting away in dungeons in villages like this. But it is impossible to help them – may God in His omnipotence rescue them from captivity!





8. Fair at Doyran





In the sancak of (—) at the border of the kadi-district of Usturumça (Strumitsa) there is a delightful wooded meadow and a broad plain. The fairgrounds are laid out like a chessboard, with several one- and two-storey stone buildings, like a large han with porta gates on four sides resembling a fortress. Lining the thoroughfares are over 1,000 shops roofed with tiles that comprise the fair. It was constructed by (—) and endowed by (—).

Over the gates are government offices as big as palaces where the magistrates and kadis and commanders with their troops sit on the market days. And there are quarters for the Sultan’s agents and treasuries for the imperial tithe which they collect from the market.

Once a year, during the cherry season, 100,000 people gather in this plain. They come from Turkey and Arabia and Persia, Hind and Sind, Samarkand and Balkh and Bukhara, Egypt and Syria and Iraq, and Western Europe – in short, from the seven climes. All the merchants of land and sea arrive here with their merchandise and set up their tents and pavilions and huts-of-sorrow and booths of reed and straw in the surrounding valleys. It is like an army-camp bazaar for the troops of Alexander the Great or Darius or Kay Khusraw. This valley becomes a sea of men. Myriads of bales of goods are brought out and bought and sold, including bird’s-milk and man’s-milk and lion’s-milk – bird’s-milk is eggs, man’s-milk is mother’s milk, and lion’s-milk is wine – you can find all of these. Indeed, of eggs, I have seen ostrich eggs. I have even see men sell their own children!

On the days of the fair, thousands of shopkeepers – purveyors of food and drink, bakers and cooks and tanners – from all the nearby towns and villages set up their tent stalls. The jostling crowds are like a rabble army, and the market is brisk for forty days and forty nights. Even women openly sell their secret wears. Thousands of people become wealthy as Korah, while other thousands dissipate their wealth in revelry and end up poor as mice.

Also there is a separate market for sheep and goats, another for horses and mules, and one for oxen and water-buffaloes. Only there is no camel market since there are no camels in Rumelia. But there is a market in human beings where thousands of lovely boys and girls are bought and sold; and a separate slave market for black Arabs with 40,000 or 50,000 customers, since blacks are highly prized as servants in these regions.

In the main fairgrounds the various shopkeepers are installed, including the great merchants, worth hundreds of thousands of guruş, who set up shop in the tiled stone buildings mentioned above. They lay out their wares – precious stuffs such as silks and satins and velvets; or jewels such as rubies, emeralds, chrysollite, turquoise, agate, etc. – turning their counter-tops into decked-out brides or idol temples of China. For this han bazaar is as secure as a fortress and everyone openly displays his most expensive goods.

Meanwhile the business in the outer fairgrounds is equally brisk. The vast plain is filled with row on row of tents, pavilions, covered stalls, booths made from kilims or from pilgrim-garbs – it resembles a tulip garden – and goods are being exchanged in every corner.

Also there are cookshops of Kay Kavus; maybe 1,000 places where whole lambs and sheep are being turned on spits; and over 1,000 coffee houses and boza shops and wine taverns. Invariably some people get drunk and brawls break out. Then the officers stationed here – the chief kadi of Serres, the colonel of the janissary troop, the tax-agent’s voyvoda and comptroller – step in and mete out fines and punishments, so the place is actually very safe.

And whatever entertainers there are on the face of the earth can be found here in the public squares and in the tents – jugglers, tightrope walkers, gamblers; players with bottles or bowls or glasses; mace-wielders, strong-men, rope-dancers, puppeteers, shadow puppet players, tumblers, sword-swallowers; trainers of dancing bears, monkeys, goats and donkeys; cudgel-wielders, lassoers, snake charmers, bird fanciers; tricksters with straps or paper or mirrors or jars or heads – in short, all the world’s conjurers and alchemists and illegitimates come here in swarms and display their skills. Then there are the singers and dancers and instrumentalists; clowns and comics; reciters of ghazals and kasides (i.e., shorter lyrics and longer odes); wrestlers and archers; pretty boys and lovers and singing girls and women.

Whoever has not seen this spectacle – and whoever has not seen the celebrations at the breaching of the Nile in Cairo, and the mevlud celebrations of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi and of Sheikh Ibrahim Dassuqi, also in Egypt – should not say that he has seen very much. As for the Doyran fair, the nights are like the Night of Power and the days like the Khwarazm-shah’s New Year’s Day.

After all the bustle and commotion and buying and selling – some making a profit, others left bankrupt – everyone returns home and the fairgrounds turn into a water mill whose stream has run dry, so a passerby would wonder if there were ever people here at all. The wise will take a lesson from this and withdraw from the pomp and show of this perishable world. But it is a wonderful spectacle!





VOLUME NINE





Pilgrimage





PILGRIMAGE TO THE HOLY CITIES of Jerusalem, Mecca and Medina had been in Evliya’s mind since he began to think of travelling. Here he recounts the dream in which his long-dead father and his old teacher urge him to make the Hajj. He sets out in May 1671, taking a leisurely route along the Anatolian coast, with – after another encounter with brigands (cf. Volume 5, selection 1) – a stop at the ancient city of Ephesus, and many other places. His peregrinations in the Holy Land include a return to Safed (cf. Volume 3, selection 2).

He finally reaches Jerusalem in January of 1672. He has very detailed descriptions of the Muslim sites – Dome of the Rock, al-Aqsa mosque; nor does he neglect the Christian sites, such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Reaching Damascus in February, where he again encounters Sheikh Bekkar the Naked (cf. Volume 3, selection 3), he now joins the Syrian pilgrimage caravan.

The pilgrimage month of that year, Dhu’l-hijja 1082 AH, corresponds to April 1672. Evliya’s Hajj account combines personal narrative with prescriptive details for other pilgrims. A good portion of the Medina materials are included here; of the more extensive Meccan materials, only the section where he characterises the populace of the city.

Having performed the Hajj rites, Evliya departs Mecca with the Egyptian caravan. He regrets that he had to travel hurriedly in both directions – toward Mecca with the Syrian caravan and from Mecca with the Egyptian caravan – rather than leisurely vice versa. After stopping at St Catherine’s monastery on Mt Sinai, he arrives in Cairo in June.





1. Setting out on the Hajj





Reason for the journey to Mecca and Mina


This humble one Evliya in my youth, when my physical faculties were in their prime, wherever the drawn bow of my eyes took aim, the arrow of my glance struck the mark. By God’s command, in whatever direction I set out, winter or summer, I reached that country. But now I remained in Istanbul for six months and it was like a prison.

Finally, on the Night of Power (27 Ramadan) 1081 (7 February 1671), invoking the aid of all the prophets and saints and noble spirits, I set out to visit the shrine of Abu Ayyub Ansari. For the Prophet has said, If you are bewildered in a matter, turn to the people of the graves for help. God be praised, I performed the visit and recited a noble Ya Sin (Sura 36), donating the merit therefrom to their noble spirit and beseeching aid from their spirits.

Aid came from God. That night, as I lay moaning and groaning in my corner of travail, free of hypocrisy and crass desires, I saw in my dream my teacher Evliya Efendi – he was a bearer of the Koran, a great sheikh and master of Koranic recitation, and served as prayer-leader to Sultan Ahmed and Sultan Mustafa. With him was my father Dervish Mehmed Ağa Zılli – he was boon-companion to Sultan Süleyman and chief goldsmith of the Sublime Porte, and a noted dervish.

I kissed their noble hands and, after much discussion, Evliya Efendi recited the Koranic verses: Travel through them by day and night in safety (30:50); and Behold then the tokens of God’s mercy (34:18). ‘Act according to these nobles verses,’ he said.

Now my father – may his earth be sweet! – recited the verse: Roam the earth (6:11). ‘Son,’ he said, ‘my advice to you is: Reflect on God’s blessings, do not reflect on God’s essence.’

After imparting their counsel they uttered a benediction and intoned a Fatiha. My father rubbed his blessed hands over my body and puffed over all my limbs. Then he took me firmly by the ear and, as though I were a schoolboy, gave me a slap on the back of the neck that caused my skull to resound like Nakhchivan steel.

‘Bind on the waistband of zeal in two places,’ he said. ‘Do not divulge secrets. Wherever you go, stay well.’

And my master Evliya Efendi chimed in: ‘Go,’ he said. ‘Travel the world in bodily health. May your helper be the Possessor of the Kingdom.’

At this I awoke, and it seemed to me that I had a different body. All my limbs throbbed with strength and a light shone on the eye of my heart. When morning came I immediately began to make provisions for my journey.

By God’s wisdom, that same day Saili Çelebi, one of the pupils of the late Azmizade Haleti Efendi, came to visit.

It was the day of festival and that moon stopped at my house.



He greeted me and said: ‘Happy days!’





We embraced and exchanged pleasantries. Then that faithful friend and homeless companion said, ‘O my brother! Why are you so despondent and indecisive? Come, let us roam the world together, let us go to Arabia and India. Haply God will provide us a leader on the path and a guide on the way, who will dispel our grief and lead us to Truth.’

Here, thought I, was the perfect wayfellow. I cheered up considerably, saying, First the companion, then the road. We swore not to besmirch ourselves with any kind of forbidden substances, intoxicants or narcotics.

‘Brother,’ said I, ‘I have experienced much of the turning of this lower world and have undergone its vicissitudes. I have drunk liver-blood from its poisoned chalice. My own liver has turned on the spit of the turning sphere and been roasted to kebab.’ (Citing a verse to this effect) I related my own ill fortunes and recounted one by one the pains and tribulations that travel entails.

My faithful friend Saili Çelebi took heed of my counsels and understood the dictum, Travel is a fragment of hell, though it be but a single parasang. And so he prepared to set out for the Hijaz.





Reason for writing down this Book of Travels

Those who roam the seas and the lands should know that this meanest of God’s creatures, Evliya the unhypocritical, son of Dervish Mehmed Zılli – who was chief goldsmith of the Sublime Porte and who, at the behest of Sultan Ahmed and in the service of the imperial surre, erected the Waterspout of Mercy (or Golden Waterspout) on the roof of the Ka‘ba, and when he returned to Istanbul uttered a benediction and prayed that I be vouchsafed pilgrimage to Mecca; this humble one – having reached the age of fifty and not once since emerging from my mother’s womb having besmirched myself with forbidden substances, intoxicants or narcotics – nursed only one wish since the time of my youth: to travel.

Finally I left my home town and the place of my birth, the pleasant land (belde-i tayyibe, cf. 34:15), i.e., Constantinople. Tying my saddlebags and braving the heat and the cold; choosing to further my education in a land of exile; desiring to roam the world and see foreign parts, in accordance with the Koranic dictum: Travel through them by day and night (34:18); I made it my ambition to examine first-hand the monuments of the seven climes that have excited the admiration of the men of knowledge and insight.

Even so, I consulted with my conscience and said: ‘Why in the course of my journeyings should I waste the precious time of my life? In addition to travel (seyahat) let me also engage in pilgrimage (ziyaret – includes visiting the shrines of holy men as well as the Hajj pilgrimage) and trade (ticaret).’

Thus I began the travail of travel, zealous to record the ancient monuments of the Well-guarded Kingdoms (i.e., the Ottoman Empire) – with its hans and mosques and medreses and other buildings, including latitudes and longitudes and the lengths of days and of rivers – for Lofty zeal is part of the Faith. And I searched out the wonders and marvels of the world, mounting my wind-swift steed, traversing the spheres and wandering from constellation to constellation like the seven planets; cutting stages and rolling stations; giving voice to my jewel-tongued pen; now describing the lands, now visiting the shrines of the prophets, now reciting the Koran; recording the hour and degree and minute of the castles that I stopped in and the mountains that I crossed; and drawing charts and figures like those in Mappa Mundi and Geography and the books of Atlas and Minor.

In the years of my journeyings I saw thousands of strange places and experienced thousands of wondrous events. Because we humans are creatures of forgetfulness, lest their traces be effaced and their names be concealed, I began to make a record of noteworthy items – both man-made and God-made (i.e., naturally occurring) – and to write them down in order to provide memory-clues, using well-worn expressions and a middling style, in accordance with the dictum, Talk to people according to the measure of their intellects.

Finally all preparations were complete. This humble one set out one day with my eight slaveboys, my three faithful companions, and my fifteen Arab steeds. We were ready, now to journey on land and sea, now to sojourn in village and city. Holding the reins of our will toward the sea, we mounted a wind-swift boat, unfurled the sails, and galloped over the waves in the direction of Üsküdar which is in the territory of the Holy Land.





2. Brigands at the Alman Pass; Ephesus





With a besmele we entered the merciless mountain pass of Alman, all our companions armed to the teeth. After advancing for half an hour we suddenly saw a band of twenty horsemen galloping toward us. We prepared to engage them, but then saw they were wounded and bleeding, fleeing from something.

‘Community of Muhammad!’ they cried. ‘Where are you going? In front of you are forty or fifty bandits. They attacked us and pillaged our goods. Now they are chasing us.’ They passed us by.

We drew ourselves together. Our janissary companions dismounted and sauntered ahead fearlessly with their muskets. At once forty men, mounted on Arab thoroughbreds, appeared from the direction of Alman Pass, some with muskets, others with bows and spears, or brandishing swords. We showered them with a volley of lead, and they halted at a distance. One of them approached and said, ‘Gazis! Just now there were twenty or thirty fleeing horsemen. Have you seen them?’

‘Yes,’ we replied.

‘Help us. They are bandits who attacked us. Praise God, we got the better of them. But our horses are exhausted. Theirs are as well; but yours are fresh. Help us chase after them!’

Now we were in a quandary. The first group said these were bandits. Was one group bandits and one group rebels? Overcoming our doubts we mingled with the newcomers and realised that they were merchants. A few, whose horses still had some vigour, started to join us.

Now, with our twenty janissary musketeers, we gave the bandits chase. God be praised, galloping with our fresh horses we caught up with them outside Alman Pass in a plain with scattered pear trees. Their horses were exhausted, so as soon as they saw us they dismounted and stood their ground. We swooped upon them and shot at them. One of my slaveboys was wounded, and one of my horses was killed. But I managed to kill four of the bandits and take six of them captive, and I gave their horses and trappings to my servants. The rest of the bandits took to the hills.

At this point, those of the forty merchants whose horses still had some vigour caught up with us. One of these, brandishing his sword, struck one of the bandits whom I had taken captive and lopped off his head.

‘This infidel killed my brother,’ he said. ‘God be praised, I have taken my revenge.’

The rest of the merchants also reached us. ‘Praise God,’ they said, ‘you have captured these devils.’ And they kissed my hands and those of our companions. ‘But what happened to the rest of them?’

‘They have taken to the hills,’ we said, and immediately we all – foot-soldiers and horsemen alike – headed for the hills in pursuit of the fleeing bandits, whom we overtook. Three youths from the band of merchants were martyred in the ensuing combat. Two of our youths were wounded slightly, as was one of my slaveboys who ran into a tree with his horse. We bound the dead on horses and tied up twelve of the bandits, taking their mounts and weapons.

Now we made common cause with the merchants. ‘You are Hızır!’ they said to us, and we said to them: ‘No, you are Hızır Ilyas!’ We set out once again into the Alman Pass and returned to where we and they had left the heavy baggage, only to discover that a three-hour battle had taken place here too. Another seven bandits had been killed, while nine of the merchants had been martyred and seven horses had fallen. This river-valley was full of corpses and weapons and flowing with blood; it had turned into a tulip-garden of a battlefield. They had had ten pack-horses, and all their bales of goods lay scattered over the ground.

‘Where is the boy so-and-so?’

‘He was martyred, there he is lying bathed in blood in the river.’

‘And what happened to so-and-so and so-and-so?’

‘The fleeing bandits drove them ahead of them.’

It turned out that they were a caravan of fifty wealthy merchants headed for Kuşadası. The forty thieves had spotted them and attacked them here in the Alman Pass. Providentially, we turned up to aid them, and the affair came off honourably.

What should we see next? The brave servants who had gone after the bandits in the mountains now came back with seven more of them in chains, plus their horses and trappings, and three heads. One of those brave youths had been martyred. Some were rejoicing, others grieving for their brother or their master. For eleven of them had quaffed the sherbet of martyrdom during the battle in this plain.

So some of the merchants were very distraught. We tried to comfort them, and suggested that we leave this merciless pass of Alman immediately. But first we buried the dead – sixteen martyrs, including four of the merchants – in rows on a grassy hill and recited a Fatiha for their spirits. It was a great battle and they were brave men. Then we brought forward the twenty-eight bandits whom we had captured and began to question them.

‘We swear by God,’ they said, ‘that we could no longer bear the oppression in our villages and for that reason sought to make our fortune here in the Alman Pass. Now, because of this battle, we have come to this pass and our fortune has been made. It is God’s to command. The brave ram is born to be sacrificed. Destiny cannot be altered. What will be will be.’

We all assembled and deliberated about what to do. Everyone had his own idea on how to turn a profit from the situation. This humble one spoke up as follows, ‘If we take these bandits in chains to the magistrate, they will say, ‘I had so many jewels tucked in my waistband and so many weapons and thoroughbreds;’ or else, ‘They tortured us and made us tell where our money was buried in the mountains and made us dig it up and then took it.’ Do you want the merit attached to performing the greatest Hajj? Then perform the greatest gaza, in accordance with the verse: Thus were the evildoers annihilated. Praise be to God, Lord of the Universe! (6:45) Here, next to your martyred brothers, let us kill them all and share out their plundered goods among ourselves. Otherwise each one of them will somehow or other get free from the magistrate’s hand and resume highway robbery, and on Judgement Day you will be responsible.’

They lent ear to my advice and together we swore on the holy Koran that the matter would remain hidden in this valley. So everyone took one bandit and invoked one martyred kinsman; or, in the case of our companions, we took eight to avenge the blood of the martyred merchants. We made them kneel down and, in a single moment, with our sharpened swords, made their heads roll on the ground like polo balls and erased their inauspicious beings from the page of time.

Alman Pass was now secure. We shared out the weapons among us. The merchants only took four of the horses; the rest were distributed among our companions and slaveboys and the merchants’ servants.

Loading the packhorses, we again set out from that battlefield in a southern direction and proceeded through that merciless, stony, Alman Pass. But God knows, we were brought to such a pass in this pass that we nearly passed out. It is not a German (Alman) pass but an unmerciful (Alaman-ı bi-aman) pass, and so stony that neither horse nor mule nor man can find a place to step. There are seventy or eighty narrow passages where one man with a stone could keep a thousand men from passing.





God be praised, we got through this pass safely in eight hours and reached a broad valley called Dalyan Ovası. Here we unloaded our packhorses and let our mounts graze. Whatever food and drink we had, we consumed. Then we continued on the road to Ayasuluk, passing the imperial fishing wiers at the place where the lake formed from the Alman Pass stream flows into the sea. We proceeded eastward in the Ayasuluk plain along the Menderes River, crossing the river by the seven-arched stone bridge, and went another hour southward through delightful sown fields until we reached:





Throne of Jamshid, the ancient Castle of Ayasuluk (Ephesus) It was built at the time when Jamshid was a world-adorning emperor and he made it his capital. Later it was ruled by a Greek king named Aya Sulya, a descendant of Jamshid. Sultan Isa, the son of Aydın Bay, conquered it in the year (—) and it later was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid the Thunderbolt at the hand of Timurtaş Pasha.

It is in the sancak of Sığla, governed by (—). It is a kadi-district at the salary level of 150 akçe per diem. It has a colonel of the local cavalry, a janissary commander, a castle warden and forty garrison soldiers. There are no town notables, but many indigents.

The fortification consists of a very strong, stone-built, oval-shaped fortress on a pointed blue rock-cliff, situated in a great plain with no higher ground looming above it. The circumference is 1,300 paces. There is no moat, since it is built on a sheer cliff and has forty strong towers. There is a two-layered iron gate looking down to the south. Inside the castle are twenty earth-covered houses and a small mosque. All the streets are paved since they are simply the sheer rock face.

Outside the castle, toward the south, is another castle with no buildings inside. It is a vast ruin, with noteworthy ruined structures. The gate, facing south, is a strange and marvellous, highly wrought ancient gate. Above the arches are a kind of fine depictions, like those of Bihzad, that dazzle the eye and puzzle the mind. Only in Athens does one find similar representations.

In the lower suburb outside this gate are noteworthy structures that cannot be expressed in words. It is clearly evident from the present remains of ancient buildings what a great entrepôt this city was in former times. It had 300 public baths, seven bedestans, 700 stone hans, 20,000 shops, 3,000 neighbourhood mosques, 800 Friday mosques, 200 medreses, 70 soup kitchens, 3,000 fountains, 1,500 primary schools; also several hundred thousand palaces and several hundred thousand private houses.

East of the city are lofty aqueducts, arches rising like rainbows into the sky. No sultan today would be capable of constructing a single such arch. They are amazing structures.

The ruined buildings are all made of white marble. Among the ruins are thousands of marble and porphyry columns, like those in Aya Sofya, lying on the ground helter-skelter. And there are thousands of arches like the Vault of Chosroes, and ruins of pools with fountain jets. Indeed, the noteworthy columns and precious rocks in the Süleymaniye and the New Mosque (Yeni Cami, i.e., the Valide Sultan mosque) in Istanbul have all come from here.

The reason why this city fell into ruins is that, according to the world-chroniclers, in the year (—) there was a great famine in Egypt. It reached the point that people were practising cannibalism. Finally the Egyptians sent a huge delegation by ship to the governor of Ayasuluk requesting money and grain, but they were spurned by the people of this city who did not give them even a mustard seed. So they cursed them, saying ‘May your city go to ruin and may you yourselves be in need of bread and salt.’ Returning to Egypt empty-handed, they told their governor what had happened. He immediately gathered 200,000 men who removed their headgear and prayed for Ayasuluk to be ruined and for its people not to thrive. Even now, in the audience hall in Cairo, the Sura of al-An‘am (6) is recited every morning as a prayer to bring about the ruin of seven cities. And one such city is this Ayasuluk, the reason for its destruction being the curse laid on it by such a great city (as Cairo).

In fact, the people of Ayasuluk are bankrupt and indigent, their granaries are empty, their salt stocks water-soaked and melted. Nevertheless, due to the spiritual influence of the great saints who rest in peace in this city, the lower suburb has about 100 earth-covered houses, twenty shops, one neighbourhood mosque, one small and oppressive bath, and one han. And there is one well of sweet water in the shade of a huge plane tree in the middle of the marketplace square – the water is like ice even in July. Here and there the houses have little gardens.





3. Safed and the land of Canaan





Description of the country of the Jews, the walled town of Safed


The first place on earth to be inhabited after the flood was the town of Cude (Judi) near Mosul. About it the Koranic verse was revealed: The ark came to rest upon al-Judi (11:44). Then Shem son of Noah built Damascus and this town of Safed. Until the time of Jacob it was so prosperous that hill and dale were full of people. It was the original homeland of the Children of Israel. Later on, when Nebuchadnezzar sought the blood of the prophet John, he massacred the Israelites and devastated Safed as well. In short, it was governed by seventy successive states until, in the year (—), Sultan Selim I took it from the despicable Circassians (i.e., Mamluks) without a blow. The troops who could not go on to Egypt he stationed there as garrison, before himself proceeding.

It is now a sancak in the province of Sidon. It is administered by farming the public revenues. The sancak-bey’s imperial has earns 373,800 akçe for him and 1,000 musketeers, leaving him a sum of 100 purses per annum. Previously it belonged to the province of Sham (Damascus) and when it was registered, had 106 timars and nine zeamets. The holders of these were not required to go on campaign but were put in charge of travellers and Muslim pilgrims, escorting them to the (Palestine) shrines, to Jerusalem and Damascus, and the seaport towns.

There are regiment commanders and commandants of janissaries in this city. It is a noble kadi-district at the salary level of 300 akçe per diem. The subdistrict (nahiye) consists of 400 rebellious villages, providing the kadi six purses per annum. The castle is in ruins. It has neither a warden nor garrison troops, nor a colonel of the local cavalry, nor a janissary colonel, nor notables. But there are many Jews. Each of the four Sunni rites has its şeyhülislam; and there is a chief of the descendants of the Prophet.

The citadel rises high into the sky. It is a lofty castle, which is within an hour’s walk from the valleys and city below. At the very summit of the mountain is a round masonry building, an ancient, wonderful castle. At the time of the conquest, Melikü’t-Tahir (al-Malik al-Zahir Baybars, in 1266) took it from the Franks only with great difficulty and had it dismantled at several places. Nowadays goats and sheep are kept there during winter. But no human beings nor any buildings are there, although the suburb below is inhabited. The houses are built one above the other, situated on places like the abyss of Ghayya in Hell. The city has seven quarters with 1,300 well-built houses covered with earth and lime.

There are (—) prayer-niches. The one with a sizeable congregation is the Sheikh Ni‘ma mosque in the marketplace. A lofty dome of elegant design covers a square enclosure measuring 50 feet on each side. The interior is revetted with marble slabs to a height of a man. For two cubits above the marble the surface, made of tiles, is painted with flowers in a great variety of colours. Over the prayer-niche the following Koranic verse is written on glazed Kashan tiles: None should visit the mosques of God except those who believe in God and the Last Day (9:18). And over the windows flanking is the verse: All that lives on earth is doomed to die (55:26). Sheikh Ni‘ma, the founder of the mosque, lies buried outside the qibla gate.

Nearby is the Overhanging Mosque (Cami-i Mu‘allak). Its lower part is empty, being used as storehouses, which in fact gave rise to the name. It is reached by a flight of seven stone steps from either end. It is a large, ancient Friday mosque.

The Red Mosque is one storey but the largest of all. The governor of the city, Salih Bey, had it repaired and restored so that it is now a place like paradise. It measures 120 feet by 80 feet. Its interior is solid masonry, domed, with groined vaults. The chronogram on the pulpit reads:



Salih renovated it in order to attain God’s pleasure.



O clever one, his Lord is the Generous, its date is: leke’r-rıza.



1082 (1671–2)





Over the prayer-niche the Throne Verse (2:255) is inscribed in large letters. Under the mosque and courtyard there is a cistern built with columns. In winter it is filled to the brim with water, which is drunk in July by all the populace to quench their thirst. It is collected rain-water, ice-cold, clear, and refreshing. The square courtyard is 100 feet on each side. Over the qibla gate there is a towering minaret roofed with lead. The roof of the mosque is plastered with lime.

The chronogram above the courtyard gate reads: In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. Our lord and sultan, king of this world and the religion, sultan of Islam and the Muslims, slayer of infidels, heretics and rebels, Baybars al-Salihi, joint partner (?) of the Commander of the Faithful, ordered the building of this blessed Friday mosque in the year 674 (1275–6).

There are besides the Friday mosques of Eynesi; Eşertah (Eser Taha?) which is that of the Forty Martyrs; Sheikh Isa in the Suvabin quarter; one in the Kurdish quarter; and the Mismar (‘Nail’) mosque, called also the Mosque of the Medrese. Besides these there are neighbourhood mosques.

There are six medreses, including the Mismariye with its large building and sound endowments; one school of Koran recitation; seven primary schools; and seven dervish lodges.

There are six public baths, three of which operate both summer and winter. Near the Pasha’s palace is the Amberiye bath, whose walls all around actually smell of ambergris. Its water and air and construction are very fine. The only bath I know that matches it is the Sultan Bath in Güzelhisar of Aydın. Then there is the New Bath, which is not so richly adorned. Another is the Apothecaries’ bath. And one bath is now closed to the public.

There are three hans, including that of (—) Pasha below the citadel. It is a large han with an iron gate like that of a castle, and square in plan. The circumference measures 600 paces. It stands four storeys high. Previously 12,000 Jews lived in it, but at present they number only 2,000.

The city has three bedestans, two of which are unoccupied, their shops being locked up. They have now become guest houses for travellers. But the bedestan of Sinan Pasha near the Sheikh Ni‘ma mosque is flourishing and in good repair. A flight of fifteen stone steps leads down to it. At both ends it is provided with iron doors. It consists of twenty shops, all built of stone. Besides these, there are another 120 shops in this city, where all precious goods are to be found.

All the houses are built of white ashlar. There is no wooden construction, except for the doors of the houses.

The most richly-adorned and solidly-built, airy and elevated, is the Pasha’s palace, with seventy finely out-fitted chambers. It is reserved for the governor’s residence. The upper audience hall has the following chronogram over the door:

My House, oppression never enter thee!



Misfortune never do thy owner wrong!



A charming house that shelters every guest,



And grows more spacious as each guest appears.





This is the imaret of Mehmed ibn Peri. In the year 980 (1572–3). Honour be to our lord, the Sultan el-Melikü’t-Tahir Ebu Sa‘id.

The orchards and gardens of Safed are mostly olive groves and mulberry plantations. Because it is situated on a high mountain its climate is healthy and agreeable. Its waters are exceedingly sweet. There are two springs of Melikü’t-Tahir (al-Zahir Baybars) that flow from the hills about the city.

Yet, because of oppression, the inhabitants of the city are poor. Jews are more numerous than Muslims. The capitation tax from all the seven Jewish quarters is paid for 9,000. With previously 70,000 Jews living here, this was a magnificent city. Still the houses are well built and cover layer on layer of hill and dale. But there is no one living in them. They have all migrated to Salonica.

In former times Safed boasted 3,000 felt manufactories, of which forty have survived. The felt of Safed was known all over the inhabited world.

The reason for the large number of Jewish inhabitants is this, that it was the original homeland of the Children of Israel and – saving the comparison! – their Ka‘ba and House of Sorrows. All the prophets and their descendants grew up here and here too they are buried. In the Jewish chronicles there are seven volumes treating of Safed.

Above the Jewish quarters are two Kurdish quarters. All their people wear striped cloaks. Lovely boys and girls are few. The women folk wear white head-covers.

Of the renowned kinds of food and drink, pure white bread, olives, and honey may especially be mentioned. Their handicraft and manufactures are kilims, felts, and prayer carpets. May God increase you!

[…]

Taking leave of the present governor, Salih Agha, and his nephew Mir Assaf, we descended from Safed a distance of one hour and a half with ten companions. On our left was Mt Uqqab. In olden times Nebuchadnezzar destroyed its castle. In the mountain there are over 500 caves, each one like the Cave of Orphans. The Children of Israel fled from the plague and hid themselves in these caves. Thereupon God sent them a barren wind so that all of them died in those caves. Their skeletons, heaped up, can still be seen there. At times people of the district keep their sheep and goats there during the winter.

Passing that place in a southerly direction, in one hour we reached a stream of fresh water known as the Valley of Laymun. It has its source at Mt Antar and here flows into Lake Minya. I passed this way when I was with Murtaza Pasha in the year 1058 (1648).

Going from there over hills and through dales and crossing barren mountains we arrived at Ayn al-tin, i.e. Stream of Figs. It has its source in the mountains of Acre and near this road flows into Lake Tiberias, i.e. Lake Minya. Its water is palatable and easily digested. The shores of this stream offer exceedingly dangerous ambush places and are the hunting-grounds of the brigands of the Turabi tribe.

Passing that in safety we came to Ayn Wadi, a small stream that comes from the mountains of the Turabi tribe and empties into Lake Minya. Though but a trickle, the water is sweet.

At this site was the great fortress of Tiberias, on the shore of Lake Minya, which Timur the unenlightened demolished on his way to Jerusalem. Reportedly it was a castle the size of Aleppo. Traces of its building are still evident. The lake is called after this fortress, properly Lake Tiberias, although popularly Lake Minya.

The province of Canaan (Ken‘an eli) ends here.





4. Jerusalem





Description of the ancient fortress and former qibla, the Sacred House (Jerusalem)


It is called in Greek the province of Ilya (Aelia), in Syriac Makdine, in Hebrew Has (for ha-‘ir ‘the City’?), and in Arabic al-Bayt al-Muqaddas (The Holy House) or al-Quds (The Holy). It contains the shrines of 124,000 prophets. Before and after the Flood it was the qibla of mankind. When the Prophet, in response to a divine order, fled from Mecca to Medina, he was fifty-one years and nine months old. He lived for ten years in Medina. In the second year (of his stay there i.e. year 2 of the Hijra) the verse from Sura of al-Baqara Turn your face towards the Holy Mosque (2:144) was revealed from God through the mediation of Gabriel the Trustworthy. Thus the qibla was changed from Jerusalem to Mecca. The obligation of fasting was revealed at the same time. But the ancient qibla was Jerusalem, and it is said to be the qibla of the poor (or of the dervishes).

This noble Jerusalem has been the object of desire of the kings of all nations. Especially the Christians who, ever since Jesus was born in this city, have waged all their wars over Jerusalem. Yet other wars were also waged by Christians over Mecca – the stories of the People of the Elephant, Abraha, and the Tubba‘ or kings of Yemen are well known.

The fortress of Jerusalem was originally built during the Caliphate of David, at the hands of Saul, because Goliath the king emerged from Aleppo and Azez and attacked Jerusalem several times. David built Jerusalem and together with King Saul fought a great battle in the place called Marj Dabiq near Aleppo. David killed Goliath with a slingshot, as attested in the verse: David slew Goliath, and God bestowed on him sovereignty (2:251). He became thereupon independent sultan and, duty done and booty won, returned to Jerusalem which he made even more prosperous with the booty from Goliath the king. In spite of his being a prophet and a sultan he occupied himself with smithery and produced mail coats. David is therefore the patron saint of the smiths.

Then in the year (—) Nebuchadnezzar emerged from the city of Nisibin in Kurdistan in order to avenge the blood of John the Baptist. Coming to Jerusalem he destroyed the fortifications and all its buildings, made mincemeat of its people, and killed thousands of Israelites. He did not stop wielding the sword until the blood stopped flowing from John’s body. He also found Daniel in Safed, took him prisoner and brought him to Mosul.

After this Jerusalem once again flourished. During the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, in the year 26 of the Hijra (647–8), it was besieged by Umar in person with 60,000 soldiers. It surrendered against safe conduct. Yet the inhabitants stipulated that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which is their main place of worship, should be left to them. Umar had a mosque built attached to the Church. He left 10,000 soldiers in the citadel and returned to Mecca, sending Amr ibn al-As to conquer Egypt.

Then again, the infidels invaded Jerusalem in the year (—) (1099). Saladin, while vizier of the martyr Nur al-Din in Damascus, advanced toward Jerusalem with 100,000 soldiers and conquered it in a desperate fight (in 1187). He had the citadel dismantled, so that the infidels might not fortify it again, should they reconquer it.

In the year 922 (1516), when Jerusalem was in the hands of the Circassians (i.e., Mamluks), all the ulema and pious men went out to meet Sultan Selim I and handed him the keys to the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Selim prostrated himself and exclaimed: ‘Thanks be to God, I am now in possession of the first qibla.’ He then made presents to all the notables and exempted them from onerous taxes. The Greek and Frankish monks showed him Umar’s noble rescript. He passed it over his face and eyes and confirmed it with his own noble rescript, stipulating that the monks were exempted from the poll tax and that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre would be their place of worship as before.

He installed (—) Pasha as governor and Ahfeşzade as molla at the salary level of 500 akçe per diem. Jerusalem was registered as capital of a province which is still awarded as a stipend to its governor at the level of vizier, the imperial has earning him 257,485 akçe per annum. There are nine zeamets and 106 timars.

The pasha of Jerusalem has 500 soldiers at his command and is the commandant of the pilgrims’ caravan of Damascus, charged with taking them to Mecca and bringing them back.

It is a prosperous province, providing its pasha an annuity of 40,000 guruş. But the timariots in his province are not ordered to serve in the field, but only to accompany with their banners the arriving pilgrims and conduct them to the places of pilgrimage. Altogether they number 600 men.

The Molla actually receives as much as the Pasha, because his district counts altogether 1,600 villages, to all of which his deputees are appointed, as his is a noble dignity of jurisdiction. It often happens that the priests and monks and patriarchs get material compensations and from these the Molla and the Pasha get 40,000 or 50,000 guruş. Especially on their infamous Festival of the Red Egg (Easter), the door of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre cannot be opened before the Pasha and the Molla arrive. From each of the five or ten thousand Christians (that come on that day) the priests take ten or fifteen guruş and give the Molla and the Pasha one tenth, which is a considerable sum.

According to Sultan Selim’s register, the sancaks in the Pasha’s province (of Palestine) are the following: Izzat al-Hashim (Gaza), Jabal Ajlun, Lajjun, Nablus, and Jerusalem which is the Pasha’s seat. Besides there are five sancaks under the rule of the desert chieftains which they administer like their own possessions, yet at the same time they owe fealty to the Sultan. There are in this province some villages set aside as pious foundations, but most belong to the mounted feudal yeomen, the holders of timar and zeamet. There is also a cavalry marshal and a troop commander.

The timariots convey the Muslim pilgrims to Abraham God’s Friend (Ibrahim Khalil, i.e. Hebron), to Bethlehem the birthplace of Jesus, and to Moses (i.e. the shrine of Nabi Musa), as the roads are insecure from the Arab brigands.

There is also a colonel of the mounted troops in Jerusalem, a commandant of the janissaries of the Porte, and a commandant of the janissaries of Damascus; muftis of the four Sunni legal rites; a supervisor of the descendants of the Prophet; and very many notables and nobles, ulema and pious men. There is also a castle warden and 100 garrison troops.

The Molla dispatches some of these troops to difficult districts and to the kadi-districts under his jurisdiction, which include Jerusalem, Hebron, Nablus, Ramla, Kerak, Lajjun, Jinnin. These have all been joined and form his jurisdiction. Additional kadi-districts may be joined to these according to the Molla’s capability; or else he may only be appointed to Jerusalem. In short, it is a noble dignity of jurisdiction providing the Molla 40,000 guruş annually.

The Molla also has twenty officers appointed by imperial rescript for court service. First is the chief usher, appointed from the imperial stirrup, who is the porter with felt cap who seizes by imperial authority. Second is the water inspector appointed especially for Jerusalem to that office which is a coveted high post. Third is the chief architect. Fourth is the chief engineer. Fifth, the chief steward. Sixth, the chief cashier, who personally pays to the ulema the yearly gifts of the Sultan. Seventh is the treasurer. Eighth is the constable. Ninth is the market inspector. Tenth is the mayor. Eleventh is the supervisor of the bedestan. In short, the sheikhs of all the tradesmen are daily present at the Sharia court for duty.

Jerusalem has 700 waqf-endowments, each with its administrator who comes to the Molla with a gift and attends the court sessions.

It is a grand civil government and religious jurisdiction.





Description of the Fortress of Jerusalem


All chronicles call this country the land of Palestine. God has praised it explicitly in forty-two passages of the Koran. For that reason all the religious communities were anxious to get hold of Jerusalem, it was besieged hundreds of times and its citadel was destroyed. Finally, during the reign of Sultan Süleyman, Lala Mustafa Pasha with (jurisdiction over) twelve sancaks was charged with rebuilding the city walls. This was done in a manner that the tongue falls short in describing.

From the foundation of the castle that was destroyed in olden times, he built up the walls measuring forty or fifty Meccan cubits from the outside. He encompassed the Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock within the walls. It is a great square fortification like Qahqaha, every ashlar the size of a Mengerusi elephant.

The circumference of the castle and the amenities inside the wall may be described as follows:

First comes the Gate of the Maghrebis (Dung Gate), a small gate opening to the south. It has been given this name because the Maghrebis conquered the city through this gate. The chronogram above the lintel reads: Order has been issued to construct this gate during the reign of the great sultan, Sultan Süleyman Khan, may God perpetuate his reign, in the holy month of Muharram of the year 947 (May 1540). This same chronogram is inscribed on all the gates and towers and on the corner bends in large letters.

Going along the city wall, which has here no moat, and leaving this Gate of the Maghrebis in a western direction, it is 500 stretched paces to the vault of the Water Tower. From there, again upwards to the westernmost point there are 1,000 paces until one reaches the Gate of David, which also looks south. It is new and twelve cubits high. From here to the corner of the Flat Tower (Yassı Kulle) is 200 paces in a western direction. This site is one corner of the fortress.

One goes from here in a northern direction. Following the edge of the moat to the east it is 600 stretched paces to the Gate of Khalil al-Rahman (Jaffa Gate). This gate opens to the west and is ten cubits high. It has a high double iron gate. It too has the chronogram above the lintel. Passing from here along the moatless skirt of the citadel in a western direction, it is 400 paces to the Crooked Tower (Eğri Kulle, i.e. Tancred’s Tower) which is the second corner of the fortress.

From here one heads north (!). Going east of this Crooked Tower in the moat, one walks down the slope through gardens and orchards, till one comes in 900 paces to the Gate of the Iron War-mace (Damascus Gate) which looks towards the north and consists of two strong iron gates. It has been given this name because a mighty mace is suspended above the gate. Outside this gate one follows the moat in an eastern direction and comes after 100 paces to the rock-cut Cave of the Demons, referring to the demons that were here imprisoned by the prophet Solomon. It is a cave protected by a talisman and worth seeing. Continuing eastward, in the moat, in front of the Cave Tower, for another 300 paces, one comes to the Flower Gate, a small iron gate facing east (!). Thence, walking along the edge of the moat toward the east, it is 500 paces to the next corner, the Gate of Rüstem Pasha.

From here one now turns to the south, walking in the moat down the slope, it is 500 paces to the of the Tribes; it is also called the Gate of Mary, since she lies buried there (Gate of St Stephen). It is a double iron gate on the eastern side facing the Mount of Olives. From here along the moatless walls of the Aqsa Mosque it is 600 paces to the Tower of the Shrine of Mary (the Cradle of Jesus) which is the fourth corner of the fortress. This completes the square circuit of the castle of Jerusalem.

From this tower one proceeds westward, with no moat, passing through chasms and frightful places in front of the Aqsa Mosque prayer-niche, and after 800 paces arrives again at the Gate of the Maghrebis.

According to this calculation the circumference of the fortress is 7,050 paces. It has fifty-seven well-fortified towers; seventy-eight bends, i.e. corners looking at the other walls; and 4,040 embrasures between the battlements of the wall. Only there is no moat for a stretch of 1,700 paces over very stony ground from the Gate of Mary to the Gate of the Maghrebis and thence past the Gate of David as far as the northern (!) corner. The moat is not necessary along this stretch, nor is there space for it. And the moats on the other sides are not very deep, only the height of two or three men.

The citadel, just inside the Gate of Khalil al-Rahman, is small – 400 paces in circumference – and connected on one side with the main fortress. It has three layers of iron gates giving into the inside of the large fortress. From the first gate one crosses a wooden bridge to the inside of the citadel. The area between the gates is an audience hall embellished with a great many war implements. In the citadel live the castle warden and the governor’s deputy; an imam, preacher and muezzins; and the garrison soldiers. There are seventy houses covered with lime, very small chambers. The castle warden has a stuccoed garden in the moat of the citadel.

The corner tower at the right-hand side of the citadel gate is the Tower of David and his noble dwelling, built by David himself. For the sake of a blessing, it is not inhabited, but is used as an ammunition depot and treasury. It has an iron door. The tower is built with ashlars measuring five to six cubits. There is no doubt that it was constructed by demons.

The moat of this citadel outside the Gate of the Friend is about 40 cubits deep and 50 Meccan cubits broad. The citadel has three storeys strongly built. Every stone is the size of an elephant. Inside is the Mosque of David with its qibla originally facing north to the Aqsa Mosque. Then, when the verse Turn your face towards the Holy Mosque (2:144) was revealed to Muhammad, the direction during prayers was instituted towards Mecca. Sultan Isa of the Ayyubids had this small mosque of David transformed into a Friday mosque, as attested by this chronogram inscribed on a white marble slab left of the prayer-niche:

In the name of God the Merciful the Compassionate. There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God. ‘Whether he is better who founds his house on the fear of God and His good pleasure’ (9:109). ‘Help from God and a speedy victory’ (61:13). This blessed tower was built by order of our lord, the glory of the world and of religion, al-Malik al-Mu‘azzam ibn al-Malik al-Adil ibn Sayf al-Din ibn Abi Bakr ibn Muhammad ibn Ayyubiyan ibn Shadi, may God perpetuate his kingdom. The construction was directed by Izz al-Din, in the land of Palestine, in the year 610 (1213–4). Praise be to God, Lord of the universe.

There are no buildings outside the fortress of Jerusalem except for the Suburb of David, which consists of 40 houses. There are only gardens and vineyards, all the buildings being inside the fortress. There are (—) Muslim quarters and 1,000 castle-like lofty palaces and other houses. All the buildings are of masonry; there is no wooden construction except for the doors. And all the houses are completely covered with lime.

There are (—) prayer-niches, two of them Friday mosques, the one within the citadel, and the other being that one designated by the decisive Koranic text: Glory be to Him who made His servant go by night from the Sacred Temple (of Mecca) to the farther Temple (17:1). God mentioned it in the noble Koran. Besides these there are no Friday mosques, all others being ordinary ones.





Description of the ancient mescid, the Mosque (cami) of Aqsa66


The building was begun by David. During his caliphate a plague broke out among the Children of Israel. When it subsided, due to the prayer of the prophet David, the mescid of Aqsa was built on the site of his prayer. Before its completion, however, David passed away and the prophet Solomon carried on the construction. David went to God’s mercy after the gaza against Goliath, the foundation of this mosque having been raised to the height of a man.

The caliphate passed to Solomon who, being sultan over all creatures, ordered the demons to complete the construction, which they did after a long period. But on that very day, as Solomon was leaning on his royal staff while watching the finishing of the mosque, the divine command came forth: Return to your Lord (89:28), and his noble spirit ascended to heaven while his body was still leaning on his staff. No one was aware of this event.

As the mescid of Aqsa was being purified, Solomon’s wise men, including the vizier Asaf Barkhaya, realised that the work was complete. They dismissed the jinns and fairies before the sunset prayer and confined the demons in the ancient prison, situated in the moat outside the Gate of the Pillar (Damascus Gate), and bound them with a talisman. In the course of time they all perished. Even nowadays one may witness their skeletons in that cave. But it is a gloomy place and one shudders on looking into it.

Later on a worm gnawed into Solomon’s staff, who thus fell to the ground. The learned men buried him next to his father David. These events are told at length in many estimable books.

Then a divine command made the Aqsa Mosque into a qibla. Many kings followed. Each built an annex to the mosque so that it became as beautiful as paradise. When the Prophet had spent ten years in Medina after the Hijra, the verse Turn your face towards the Holy Mosque (2:144) was revealed, whereupon the qibla was changed from Jerusalem to Mecca. But it was about Jerusalem that the verse Let them circle the Ancient House (22:29) was revealed. At present it is the Ka‘ba of the poor (or of the dervishes).

It is a large light-filled mosque, 300 feet in length from the qibla gate to the prayer-niche. Its width from the prayer-niche of Umar on the eastern side to that of the Malikis is 400 feet. Inside are seventy large and small columns of porphyry, etc., both artificial and natural.67 Each column is a jewel in itself, worth an Egyptian treasure.

Both aisles of the mosque are later additions, with arches and domes raised above artificial columns. But the original building in the centre is in tiers, one above the other, with arches above natural columns, topped by a ridged wooden ceiling, painted in various colours, resting on twenty beams of cypress wood – a marvellous sight. The central dome rises 40 cubits from the floor, while the annexes on either side are twenty cubits high.

The interior of the mosque has a total of 120 arches, large and small.

The light-filled dome over the prayer-niche is the highest part of the building and unrivalled on the face of the earth. It is 50 cubits high and supported by the other domes as though it were their crown. It is elliptical, while the other domes are round. Inside it is embellished with gilded glass-mosaic designs in iridescent colours representing the Tuba tree of paradise and multicoloured flowers. It is a dome of light upon light around which is the verse God is the light of the heavens and the earth (24:35).

The restoration of the mosque by Sultan Süleyman and the prayer-niche and pulpit are beyond description. True, the pulpit is of wood; yet, in order to show his skill, the accomplished master designed such a finely-wrought pulpit that it is like witchcraft. As to the prayer-niche, it is profusely gilded, as if it were a lapis-lazuli enamel work studded with jewels. Whatever of precious metals or stones is known on earth has been carved like bird’s eyes and inserted by the accomplished master into that jewel-like prayer-niche of indescribably beauty.

Above the prayer-niche – and in accordance with the artistry of the prayerniche, pulpit and dome – the master glass artisan Serhoş İbro (‘Drunkard Abe’), who was one of Sultan Süleyman’s teachers, made twelve magical mosaic panels of multicoloured iridescent bits of glass. As they reflect the rays of the sun, the mosque, which was light, becomes light upon light and the congregants’ eyes shine with reverence and humility as they pray. Aside from these panels there are 105 panes of rock-crystal and cut glass.



The wall on the prayer-niche side is covered with coloured and veined marble slabs the height of three men. If you examine them closely you can observe God’s handiwork, so shiny and polished are they. In this wall also, to the left and right of the prayer-niche, are seven windows that look onto the Rock outside. Facing the pulpit is the muezzins’ gallery set like a pavilion on twelve well-proportioned slender columns. There is also a preacher’s seat, like the throne of Solomon, with cunningly carved Indian woodwork like Fahri cutouts.

The silk prayer-carpets in this mosque are marvellous, each one a masterpiece of Turkish or Arab or Persian weaving, unmatched in other mosques. And there are thousands of costly and highly-wrought chandeliers and 7,000 lamps. 1,000 of these latter are lit every night, and the rest on holidays and festivals, so that the interior of the mosque, already luminous, becomes light upon light.

The mosque has ten gates, seven of which open to the south. The central gate rises to a height of fifteen cubits. It is of ancient make and of enamelled brass. The three gates flanking it on either side are shorter but also masterworks and worth seeing. To the left is the Gate of Hızır; to the right, the Gate of the Malikis; at the foot of the minber, the Gate of the Medrese. Outside the south gates are vaults over six piers, forming a kind of vestibule.

When one visits the Aqsa Mosque, one comes first to the prayer-niche of Umar, in the east corner, where he performed his prayers during a whole week after the conquest. Next is the prayer-niche of David, where prayers used to be offered while the foundations were dug. To the left of it, on a stand, is the ancient Koran in the handwriting of Uthman, in Kufic characters, as though written by the Hand of Power. One visits next the Station of Jesus, to the right of the pulpit; it is a praying-place behind a well-wrought iron grill and has a separate entrance. Finally one comes to the Station of Hızır at the gate on the left side of the mosque. God be praised, I visited all of them and offered at each two prostrations beseeching their intercession.

There are 800 salaried servants employed at this Aqsa Mosque. It has imams for the four Sunni rites and as many preachers. On Fridays the preacher ascends the pulpit with sword in hand – it is the sharp sword that belonged to Umar himself. Each preacher is on duty for a week. There are fifty muezzins, reciters of litanies, masters of ceremonies, chanters of hymns in praise of the Prophet, chanters of devir, reciters of one of the thirty parts of the Koran, and caretakers. All these offices are paid from the private purse of the Sultan. The agent in charge of the annual sultanic gifts comes every year and distributes the emoluments.

The domes of the Aqsa Mosque are completely covered with lead. All the domes are topped by golden finials, to the height of a man, dazzling to behold.





Description of the Dome of the Rock


From the Aqsa Mosque one proceeds north through a meadow and then 200 paces over flagstones of white unhewn marble laid out by order of Sultan Süleyman. There is a large round basin made of one huge block of marble; Sultan Süleyman saw it in his dream and it was constructed to his specification when he woke up in the morning. It is unmatched on the face of the earth, a remarkable radiant basin made by God’s handwork that occupies the centre of this great courtyard.

Passing this, one continues northward another twelve paces and comes to a flight of twenty-two white marble steps leading to the Dome of the Rock. Their width is twenty cubits, so that 1,000 pilgrims could ascend them without crowding. At the top of these steps one beholds the Holy Rock, or rather the structure that encloses it, in the very centre of the courtyard. When one sees it, gleeming like a plastered pavilion, one recites this prayer: O God, put a light in my heart and a light in my ear and a light in my eye. Make me a light by Your mercy, O most merciful of the merciful.

Coming from the direction of the Aqsa Mosque, there is a tiny pulpit at the foot of the courtyard gate. Here pilgrims take their shoes in their hands and walk barefoot 100 paces over the white marble flagstones until they arrive at the gate of the Dome of the Rock where they leave their shoes in the custody of the doorkeepers and start their visit.

It was Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan who first started the construction of this Holy Rock in the year 85 (704). Subsequently, since it is the former qibla, many kings and sultans built annexes to it.

In the year (—) Sultan Süleyman, having conquered Belgrade at the beginning of his reign and having taken Rhodes from the (Knights of) Malta and got the wealth of Korah, and having become an independent sultan, one blessed night saw the Prophet in his dream.

‘O Süleyman,’ he said, ‘you will live forty-eight years and make many gazas. Your descendants will not be cut off till the end of time. My intercession will be always extended to you. However, you should spend these spoils on Mecca and Medina, and for the fortification of Jerusalem, lest the infidels invade it during the reigns of your followers. You should also install a water-basin in its courtyard and embellish the Dome of the Rock and offer annual gifts to the dervishes there and rebuild Jerusalem.’

Such being the order of the Prophet, Sultan Süleyman at once rose from his sleep and sent from his spoils of gaza 1,000 purses each to Mecca and Medina and Jerusalem. He dispatched the Grand Architect (Sinan) to Jerusalem with the required material. And he transferred Lala Mustafa Pasha from the governorship of Egypt to that of Syria, charging him with carrying out the restoration of Jerusalem. The pasha gathered all the master measurers and marble-carvers and painters available in Cairo, Damascus and Aleppo and sent them to Jerusalem.

They embellished the noble city and the elegant Rock to such an extent that the verse These are the gardens of Eden, enter and dwell there forever (cf. 39:73) was justly written over the Gate of Paradise of the noble Rock. Verily, it is a replica of a pavilion in paradise. This humble one has travelled for thirty-eight years through seventeen empires and has viewed countless buildings, but I have never seen one that so resembled paradise.

When a person enters, he stands dumbfounded and amazed, with finger to mouth. It is a light-filled mosque (cami!) like a Palace of Khawarnaq in the middle of a plain paved with white marble. From the outside the courtyard is 300 paces in circumference. The building is octagonal. The outside is covered with veined marble and porphyry casements, to the height of three men, each slab manifesting God’s handiwork.

Between these casements and the eaves of the dome is a layer of finely-wrought and delightfully painted tiles inscribed in blue with the Ya Sin, the calligraphy being in the style of Ahmed Karahisari. At each corner (of the octagon) such verses as ‘Peace!’ shall be the word spoken by a merciful God (36:58) and Nor can I succeed without God’s help (11:88) are written in large letters.

Above these inscribed tiles are spouts for the rain-water made of tinned copper. Further up are the eaves of the dome, covered all around by lead sheets. And above the eaves, the drum is enclosed with painted tiles, ten cubits high and of excellent execution.

Then the blue and light-filled dome rises into the sky. It is not round like other domes, but elliptical like the dome over the shrine of Jalaladdin Rumi in Konya. The finial is twelve cubits high, so they say, and so richly gilt that its glittering can be seen at a distance of a day’s journey. The Rock is under this lofty dome.

This shrine has four doors: the (—) Gate looking south, the (—) Gate looking east, the Gate of Paradise looking north, and the (—) Gate looking west. These double doors are of yellow brass, like gold – no master could nowadays execute such work – and are ten cubits high. Each one has double curtains of embroidered broadcloth, for the rainy season in Jerusalem is severe.

Inside these doors there are four zones (concentric circles) until one reaches the Rock. In the first zone, the inner wall, like the outer wall just described, is covered with varicoloured and veined marble and porphyry slabs. They are so cut as to form pairs: placed side by side, they produce many curious inscriptions and designs. This is so on the outside as well. Thus, as one enters the (—) Gate in the direction of the Rock, on the encasing marble to the right of the door is the picture of two cocks, beak against beak, with outspread wings. By God’s command, there are many such animal and floral designs in this veined marble that are visible when one looks close.

In the wall of this first zone are (—) windows overlooking the courtyard. Above them are panels of stained glass with marvellous colours and such inscriptions as There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God and God is the light of the heavens and the earth (24:35), or the names of the first four caliphs. It is licit magic.

The inner part of the first zone is not a wall but a circle of twenty-four lofty columns connected by arches which support the high dome. Sixteen of the twenty-four are monoliths, wrought by the Hand of Power, veined porphyry columns of indescribable beauty. The other eight are artificial square piers. The master builder lavishly adorned them with richly gilt ornamentations, like the enamel on a timepiece or the paintings of Mani. When the sun’s rays fall through the stained window glass on these piers, the effect is dazzling to one unaccustomed to the sight.

The ceiling between these twenty-four columns and the wall is tooled camel leather, with designs that Bihzad, Mani, Shah Quli, Vali Jan or Agha Riza could not achieve with a paintbrush. This ceiling is divided into eight compartments, each with designs in a different pattern.

Under the arches supported by this colonnade are balconies for people to walk around and light the oil lamps. In front of this row of columns, in the first wall, is the Hanafi prayer-niche where a large congregation offers the five daily prayers. It has an imam and muezzins attached to it, and there is a muezzins’ gallery over the door leading to the cave of the Rock, but there is no pulpit. Costly silken carpets are spread out on the floor.

The inner part of the second zone has another row of variegated porphyry columns, numbering twelve in all, like rubies, each worth the annual harac of Turkey. The dome above, full of divine lights, rests on this circle of columns. The ceiling between the second row of columns and this third row is also tooled camel leather. It is divided into sixteen compartments, each displaying the magical skill of a past master.

Between these columns of the third row, all around, an iron grill has been placed. It is almost miraculous, like the work of David the ironmonger. There are doors in four places through this iron grill to enter the Holy Rock. They are highly-wrought doors that open to the four cardinal points.

Inward from this grill is another layer, a railing of cypress-wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl, that surrounds the Holy Rock. It has no door or chute, and no one is allowed to go beyond it. Only the very noble (—) -zade enters the enclosure once a year to sweep the dust. All pilgrims circumambulate the Rock outside the railing.





Description of the Holy Rock


It should not be concealed from my brethren pilgrims and travellers that the so-called Holy Rock is a white rock enclosed by this railing and, following its edge, 100 paces in circumference. Through the railing one perceives a flat rock, called the Holy Rock (Sakhrat Allah, lit. Rock of God). Some commentators are of the opinion that the verse His are the keys of the heavens and the earth (42:12) means to say, ‘My beloved Muhammad! I created the face of the earth, then I locked it with keys, i.e., I secured it with mountains.’ Others interpret ‘keys’ as first of all Mt Arafat and second the Holy Rock; and upon this second key the divine glance was fastened, so that Jerusalem was the place of prayer of the tribes of jinn.

Even in that remote time the Holy Rock was a place of pilgrimage and the qibla of mankind, as mentioned above. Then the Prophet received the gift of prophecy at the age of forty in Mecca where he lived for another thirteen years. When he was fifty-one years and nine months old, Gabriel the Trustworthy came from God and said, ‘O Muhammad! God greets you and wishes that you visit His Jerusalem by means of the rolling up of space.’68

So the Beloved of God performed the rolling up of space together with Gabriel the Trustworthy. Some intoxicated (?) persons say no, he went from Mecca to Jerusalem together with Buraq. While there is controversy on this point, all agree that he came to Jerusalem (on the Night Journey) where all the spirits of the prophets welcomed him. He performed his prayers in the grotto under the Holy Rock. No sooner did he pass his hands over his face than Gabriel again came from God and said, ‘O Muhammad! God greets you and has sent Buraq, who is a spark from the paradise of Firdaws, bidding you mount and see His Throne and Seat, His Tablet and Pen, and His eight paradises, and to behold His beauty without intermediary.’

The Prophet obeyed the divine order, left the Grotto of the Rock and made two prostrations on the Holy Rock. Even now the marks of his noble head while prostrating and the impressions made by his blessed knees on the Rock are still visible – so they say, but no one is allowed to visit them.

After that the Prophet mounted Buraq with a besmele and, reciting the verse Embark, in the name of God it shall set sail and cast anchor (11:41) and striking Buraq with the whip of monotheism he easily rose to the highest heaven. Hearing a loud noise behind him he turned his blessed head and saw that the Holy Rock had left its mooring and was crying, ‘O Muhammad! Take me along into God’s presence.’ Immediately the Prophet addressed the Rock thus, ‘O Holy Rock! Remain suspended, by God’s permission.’ Thereupon the Rock remained suspended in the air, by God’s permission, at the point it had reached, not touching the ground anywhere. And because it is suspended between heaven and earth it is called the Hanging Rock. But it is the Holy Rock and, according to the chroniclers, the second of the two ‘keys’ that were created on the face of the earth. Knowledge is with God.

According to the Tevarih-i Tuhfe there are two rocks which came from the heavenly paradise. One is the Black Stone (in the Ka‘ba) which was originally ruby-red. During Noah’s flood it remained in the water of the abyss, and sinners wiped their faces against it. Thus it changed its colour and became the Black Stone. And the other is this Holy Rock. Knowledge is with God.

The late Sultan Ahmed (I, reg. 1603–17) had a richly gilt canopy made, the cover of which was a curtain studded with gold and jewels, and fastened it to the surrounding columns to make a baldachin over the Rock. From this baldachin to the highest point of the dome is a height of 40 to 50 cubits. The interior of this indigo-coloured dome is covered over its whole surface with gold, studded with precious stones set in enamel. The one who painted all four sides is the painter known as Shah Quli.

When the Holy Rock flew after the Prophet and remained suspended in midair by his command, a large cavern remained underneath, which is a shrine that can hold 200 men. It is entered through a door of grilled iron that is reached after descending (—) stone steps under the muezzins’ gallery behind the Hanafi prayer-niche. Below it there is a spacious room and a prayer place for pious pilgrims.

One of the Caliphs of bygone days had a thin partition wall erected underneath the Holy Rock so that pilgrims would not be overawed at seeing it suspended, but could offer their prayers with presence of mind and absence of fear. For many a pregnant woman who had entered the cavern and seen the Rock suspended had miscarried at the very sight. Yet there is still a space between the wall and the rock, enough to put a finger or, in some places, an entire hand!

[…]

God be praised, I visited all the sites (in the Haram area) in ten days and ten nights during Ramadan of 1082 (January 1672). And I completed a Koran recitation on the Night of Power (27 Ramadan) in the temple of the Aqsa Mosque and bestowed the religious merit accrued therefrom upon the spirits of those departed believers buried in Jerusalem.

Description of the interior of the settlement of Jerusalem


It should be known to the world-viewing lovers that this city of Jerusalem, although it appears small, yet contains 240 prayer-niches. Aside from the Aqsa Mosque and the congregational mosque in the citadel they are all medreses and dervish convents and small neighbourhood mosques.

There are seven Hadith schools, ten schools of Koran recitation, and forty primary schools.

Each of the seventy dervish orders has a convent, including the Qadiri, the Badawi, the Sa‘di and the Rufa‘i. The most frequented is the Mevlevi convent just inside the Gate of the Pillar; it is also a place of promenade. All of these have a contingent of dervishes who perform a Muhammadan ceremony (i.e., zikr) every blessed night, and all have sound endowments.

There are six great hans, including those of Ghawriya, Khasakiya, the Soup Kitchen, and the Marketplace.

There are six public baths: the Mother Mary Bath, with fine air and water; the Sultan Bath; the Shifa Bath, whose water has curative properties; the Bath of the Spring; the Bath of the Rock; and the Bath of the Patriarch, called so because it is mainly frequented by Christians and is near their quarter.

There are three soup kitchens that distribute food to sojourners. The Khasakiya soup kitchen has sound endowments.

There are eighteen fountains, including that of Sultan Süleyman. They all have chronograms indicating the year 947 (1540–1). Aside from these there are seventy places in the city with flowing water in pools and jets. The water was brought from a stony and forested area near Khalil al-Rahman (Hebron), four hours away, by Sultan Süleyman. He spent an Egyptian treasure and made Jerusalem run with water – a remarkable public works.

Previously the only water in the city was what accumulated in cisterns. Thus, between the Gate of Mary and the Hıtta Gate there is a large cistern, now empty, known as the Lake of the Children of Israel; it is 50 cubits deep, 100 paces long and 80 paces wide. Other cisterns are found in the moat outside the Gate of the Pillar. There are also lakes, now dried up, in the moat outside the Gate of Mary. And there used to be cisterns in the Harams of the Aqsa Mosque and the Rock. The city depended on them; but Sultan Süleyman obviated the need for them by channeling a great river, so now all who satisfy their thirst utter a Fatiha on behalf of his noble spirit – may God have mercy on him.

The royal marketplace of this city contains 2,045 shops, according to the market inspector’s register. But the roads are narrow. Most of the market consists of vaulted stone buildings, like those in Aleppo. All around the Han of the Marketplace is the bazaar of the mounted troops where precious items of every sort can be found. The Long Market and the markets of the goldsmiths, wool carders and silk merchants are vaulted stone buildings, never marred with mud. The shoe market, just inside the (—) Gate near the Rock, is also a stone building.

All the streets in this city are paved with pure white polished stone. The major thoroughfare – extending from the grain market to the door of Umar’s mosque, attached to the wall of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre – has paving-stones the size of kilims. They say it was constructed by Solomon’s demons.

There are water dispensaries in forty places.

While there is no separate bedestan with iron gates, precious stuffs from all over the world are found here, because it is a prosperous city and crowded entrepôt.

There are seven churches in this city, two Jewish (!), two Armenian, and three Greek. Among them is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, belonging to the Greeks. It was built by Yanko ibn Madyan (who is?) Alexander of the Greeks. Above the door is an inscription in Greek language giving the date of construction. It was – saving the comparison! – the Ka‘ba of the Christians during the lifetime of Jesus.

Even now 5,000 or 10,000 hell-destined infidels gather here every year on their infamous Festival of the Red Egg (Easter). Greeks and Armenians come from the seven climes, and fractious Franks from eighteen kingdoms. On the days of their assembly here, the Pasha and the Molla and şeyhülislam and the notables of the province, as well as all the Ottoman military personnel, fully armed, stand ready in front of the Church to prevent 10,000 infidels from swarming into it to perform their pilgrimage. The trustee of the Church utters a benediction upon the Sultan of Islam and a malediction upon the infidels. The Pasha and the Molla break the seal of the Church’s door and open it, because for the rest of the year it is sealed shut.

Notwithstanding, there are 200 or 300 permanent residents – more like prisoners, actually – priests, monks, patriarchs and other kinds of ecclesiastics belonging to the Franks, Greeks, Armenians, Copts, and other Christian communities. Their food and drink comes from their soup kitchens attached to the churches in the surrounding districts. It is brought by servants and handed to the priests inside through a hole in the door.

Thus the churchmen on the inside practise their austerities for an entire year, shut off from the world. On the day when the door is opened, in the presence of the Pasha and the Molla, there is an exchange of personnel, some going in and some coming out. At this juncture, those infidels who wish to perform their pilgrimage are charged ten gold pieces each for the privilege of entering, and this sum is divided between the Pasha and the Molla.

On that day and until the evening there is pandemonium, as the infidels celebrate their infelicitous festival. After the evening prayer the Pasha shuts the door and everyone leaves the Church. But armed guards remain stationed in the rest of the city and at the fortifications, because sometimes 20,000 infelicitous infidels are gathered here.

The same procedure occurs for three consecutive days, with the Church door opened in the morning and closed at night. The funds accrued thereby are distributed among the ulema and sheikhs and other pious men of the Muslims; for the income of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is a kind of zeamet belonging to the populace of Jerusalem. At the end of three days, when their infamous festival is finished, criers go through the town announcing the fact, and all the infidel pilgrims scatter to perform their other visits.

In sum, there is no great cathedral on the face of the earth so worthy of notice, unless it be the Stephan Monastery in Vienna. But this one is even more finely built and embellished. The walls are covered with variegated designs, the work of masters who practise their art even today. The intricate carving in the marble revetments at the windows and arches is beyond compare, like Fahri paper cutouts. On either side of the door are three slender marble columns. Left of the door is a highly-wrought cupolatopped pavilion of Constantine, reached by seventeen stone steps – a marvellous vault like the pavilion of Chosroes. In front of the door the courtyard is paved with white marble.

This humble one visited Jerusalem several times. But in the year 1058 (1648) – the year of the enthronement of Sultan Mehmed (IV) – when Zileli Çavuşzade Mehmed Pasha was governor of Jerusalem province, I received permission to break the seal and tour the inside of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The door opens to the Muhammadan qibla (i.e., south). I entered, saying ‘I take refuge in God.’ Upon entering, seven domes, great and small, come into view. The central dome is that of the ridged roof, a large inverted (?) dome constructed on artificial piers. The interior is gilded glass enamel, at the level of magical Rumi painting.

Another well-proportioned dome is constructed on four red porphyry columns, each one worth the annual revenue of Turkey. These columns are so highly polished that one can see one’s features reflected in them.

The ‘qibla’ of this church – saving the comparison! – is a gilt semi-dome on the eastern side.

Another lofty dome, attached to the western side of the central dome, resembles that of Aya Sofya in Salonica, except that this one is open in the middle. According to the chronicle of Ibn Abbas, there were 882 years between the death of Alexander the Great and the birth of the Beloved of God (the Prophet); and according to the Greek histories there were 600 years from the time of Jesus to that of the Seal of the Prophets. When he was born on the night of Monday, the 12th of the month of Rabi‘ al-awwal, the Vault of Chosroes and the Pavilion of Khawarnaq and the dome of Aya Sofya (in Istanbul) and this dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre all collapsed. Repairs were attempted several times with the aid of the kings, but failed each time. Now the cover is open and birds are kept out with wire mesh. Later, with funds provided by one of the kings, a smaller dome was constructed underneath this open dome; it too is a remarkably fine object.

The Christian Greeks reside to the south of this dome. The Franks reside toward the large door. The Armenians are to the north. Every corner has a different nation and language. But the Greeks are in charge. The reason is that when Umar conquered Jerusalem from the Byzantine emperor, he renewed the pact that had been drawn up between the monks and the Prophet and gave this Church of the Holy Sepulchre into the hands of the Greeks, exempting all the monks from the poll tax. Later, when Sultan Selim I conquered Jerusalem, the monks produced the pacts of the Prophet and Umar and the other kings of Egypt. Selim confirmed them, and they are reconfirmed whenever an Ottoman sultan assumes the throne. That is why the Greeks are in charge.

The cellars of this church, which run underneath it from end to end, are full of the votive offerings that have arrived here from the various Christian kingdoms of the seven climes for thousands of years – only God could reckon them. The highly-wrought and jewel-encrusted chandeliers and oil-lamps are not to be found in any other church. And I can’t tell you how many idols and icons and statues there are, each one like Wadd and Suwa‘ and Yaghuth and Ya‘uq (pre-Islamic idols mentioned in 71:23). There are also the portraits of the kings who endowed repairs and sent votives, like the work of Azar (father of Abraham), which astound the observer.

On the side of the prayer-niches (i.e. altar), over a gallery, is a statue of Jesus – saving the comparison! – with his hands raised in prayer as though in supplication. I enquired about it and they told me it was the Spirit of God (i.e. Jesus). Indeed, the statue seemed alive (lit. having a spirit – zi-ruh). Whatever direction you look, it too looks in that direction. If you move right or left, it seems to follow you. If you smile it smiles back, and if you cry it starts to weep. God knows, even Mani or Bihzad, Arzhang or Vali Jan would be incapable of drawing such a figure. This ancient church contains many such magical depictions, recalling the verse:



You can depict the fuzz on his cheek



And the beauty-mark on his arm;



But, O Bihzad, how can you draw



His coquetries and charm?





In front of this statue of Jesus is a large crystal lamp, suspended in the middle of the dome. There is a superstitious belief that this lamp burns by a divine miracle. But this humble one examined it very closely and discovered the secret. The lamp is made of precious rock-crystal or cut glass or plain crystal, and is highly-wrought and studded with gems. The chain by which it is suspended in the middle of the dome is curiously wrought and jewelled as well.

The reason it burns on their notorious Festival of the Red Egg (Easter) is this: There is a zinc jar concealed in lead at the apogee of the dome. It contains olive oil mixed with a small amount of naphtha. During the days of the festival, because of the heat, the oil in the jar drips down through that highly-wrought chain and fills the lamp, with none of the infidels aware of it. The wall on the eastern side of the Church, above the prayer-niche which is their ‘qibla’ (i.e., altar), has been embellished by the clever master builder with panes of crystal and/or glass. At noon on the Red Egg days, the glass panes get very hot from the beating of the sun. This heat in turn affects the large lamp, which bursts into flame.

If the weather happens to be cloudy on those days, and the sun is not strong enough to produce this effect, one of the clever monks secretly climbs on top of the dome and kindles the oil mixed with naphtha at the tip of the chain. The fire runs down the chain, in plain view of the infidels standing below, who think that it is fire from heaven. Awestruck, they remove their hats and cry Kiryeleys, Kiryeleys!

In this manner the fire of Nimrod descends into that lamp and lights up the interior of the Church. The monks use the fire in that lamp to kindle the thousands of candles that the infidels have in their hands, and the infidels in turn take those nefarious camphor candles and distribute the fire throughout the Christian world. Vast sums are earned from this trade as well. It is indeed a strange art of the lamp. Even the monks who expend their lives in this church are not aware of it. Only the one who attends this lamp knows about it, and he keeps it to himself, only passing on the secret to another one before he dies.

In the middle of this dome there is a canopy attached to the piers on all four sides by tent ropes. It is precious stuff of thin material, embroidered with gold. The floor of the church has no carpets, but rather is paved with tiny precious stones, ‘bird’s-eye’ work, like Indian marquetry.

All around this church are hundreds of expensive chairs, each one the memento of a king or other sort of infidel nobility. On the eastern side, under an arch, is a statue of Mother Mary holding, as it were, the baby Jesus in her embrace. This statue too seems alive (lit. having a spirit – ziruh), the mother of the Spirit of God (Ruhullah, i.e. Jesus). Her necklace of pearls and rubies and diamonds is worth five Egyptian treasures. There are various other statues as well, each the relic of one infidel or another.

This Church also houses Jesus’s clogs, his black cloak, his waistband made of date-palm fronds, and his black turban. On one jewelled casket is one of his genuine Gospels; in another, the pact of the Prophet, sealed with his seal reading There is no god but God. All the pacts acceded to by his successors are also preserved in this Church.

The austerities practised by the monks here are certainly admirable, though we do not look favourably on them; for, according to our religion, There is no monkery in Islam.

The wonder of this place is that, with so much beautiful adornment, it lacks spirituality; it is more like a tourist attraction.

After touring the Church and performing two prostrations in a corner, I prayed that it one day become a Muslim place of worship, and came outside. The monk who showed me around had the appearance of being a heretic of the infidels. I put this question to him, ‘You devils! Why do you worship these idols you have made? Why do you greet them and revere them and take them as your gods?’

‘By God,’ he replied, ‘we do not worship them, nor do we bow down before them. Only our Greeks are a bunch of stupid and credulous people. Our priests cannot get them to understand religious doctrines through preaching, so they point to those images. Also, anyone who sends a votive offering to our monastery, or who sponsors some repair, we make a statue of him and inscribe his name on it as so-and-so the donor of such-and-such. Or we bury him in the monastery, having got thousands of ducats from him, and people who see his grave or his statue pay him reverence. This constitutes our zeamet. This is how we earn money for ourselves and for the pashas and for you. As for bowing down and worshipping, that we do to God alone.’

Thus he put a good construction on their idol-worship.

Seven steps southward from this Church along the main road is a bell-tower connected to the church wall. It rises twenty storeys into the sky. But the bell does not function, since Umar tore down the summit of the tower. But there is an organ-loft here, again attached to the church. On their unholidays they play the Psalms of David on the organ in the rehavi musical mode, which stuns the listener.

Here we went up some stairs and through a door inside. It turned out to be the Church’s soup kitchen, with some 200 dirty and ignorant cooks. The food prepared here suits the austere diet of the monks – we were told it is completely vegetarian.

All the buildings of this Church are covered with thick lead, each tile being four spans square, not three cubits as in Istanbul. The lead is mixed with quite a bit of gold, as we were told by some goldsmiths, and wherever there is gold there is also lead.

Emerging from the kitchen door back out to the main road (one comes to the Mosque of Umar).





{Concerning the founder of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.


According to the Greek chronicles, Constantine founded Istanbul 328 years after the birth of Jesus. His mother, Lady (Mayfirav) Helena, was the daughter of a king of the city of Ruha (Urfa, Edessa). She came to Jerusalem with 40 million of Constantine’s money and found some relics of Jesus. While constructing buildings she had endowed, she found in Jerusalem an ancient patriarch of the Magi named Makarios. It seems that the Jews had crucified Jesus at this priest’s instigation and he knew the tree (or piece of wood) on which the crucifixion happened. Eventually he showed Helena the place. She excavated and found a grave and three trees (or pieces of wood) in the shape of crosses.

The Christians claim that they lay those trees (or pieces of wood) one by one over the corpse inside that grave and it suddenly came to life and stood up. That day – which is the 14th of September – is still observed by Christians who throw crosses into water (? – lacuna in the text). The infidels’ reverence for the cross stems from this event. The resurrection of that corpse when the crosses were laid on it is recorded in the Coptic and Greek chronicles.

After discovering these crosses Helena had them preserved in a jewelled gold casket. She built this Church of the Holy Sepulchre in seven years. The Christians believe (? – lacuna in the text) that it was built over that resurrected corpse, and that that was actually the corpse of Jesus – God forbid! – and that he subsequently rose into heaven. Others say no, after being resurrected he summoned his people (to faith) and then died. Still others are the messianics who say he is the Spirit of God, and that the prophet Idris and the prophet Jesus are alive in heaven (? – lacuna in the text). Such are the wayward Christians among whom doubt and dissention have arisen.

The aforementioned Helena repaired (!) the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Aqsa Mosque, embellished the Dome of the Rock, and renovated Bethlehem, making each of them like paradise and endowing soup kitchens. On her way back to Turkey, she slaughtered myriads of Jews. She entered Constantinople in grand procession and presented Constantine with the golden casket containing the crosses from Jesus’s grave, saying they were relics of Jesus and the name of God. He rubbed his face on the crosses and preserved them. This is how the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was founded.}

66 Evliya usually carefully distinguishes between mescid, a small neighbourhood mosque, and cami, a large mosque used for the Friday congregational worship. The Aqsa Mosque clearly falls in the second category; but Evliya also refers to it as mescid because it is identified with the mosque called al-masjid al-aqsa in Koran 17:1 (translated as ‘the farther Temple’ in the citation just above).



67 Here ‘artificial’ or ‘man-made’ (ameli) probably means joined out of several pieces, while ‘natural’ or ‘God-made’ (sun‘-ı huda) means carved out of a single piece. ‘Natural’ in the next paragraph translates yed-i kudret, lit. ‘Hand of Power’, also implying God-made not man-made.



68Tayy-i mekan, defined by Redhouse as a going from one place to another in a miraculous way regardless of distance.





5. Sheikh Bekkar the Naked in Damascus





One day, while I was paying court to Kara Murtaza Pasha in Damascus, ten stalwart youths in his retinue came to me and said: ‘Evliya Çelebi, please get a leave for us from the treasurer. We’re going to visit our relatives in the Turkman district.’

I didn’t like the idea. ‘Perhaps the Pasha will want to go out riding when you are gone,’ I said. ‘If he asks where you are, and is told that you went out, what will become of you?’ I did not ask leave from the treasurer, but they got it anyway, using the key-boy as intermediary. Then they came to my room and said, ‘Without you we have no life. Don’t be a spoil-sport. You have to come with us.’ So I went along, willy-nilly.

As the eleven of us fine gentlemen were sauntering through the crowd in the Sinaniye Market, we saw coming toward us the above-mentioned Sheikh Bekkar, stark naked, with his hands on his shoulders and his genitals swaying to and fro. Suddenly he came up to me and slapped my face with the slap of a holy idiot. I reeled, and blood gushed from my nose onto my green cloak. When I looked up, I saw that all my companions had fled. Sheikh Bekkar seized me by the hand and began to parade me around the marketplace as though he were a slave broker, shouting, ‘One sinner for sale! One new one! For sale! One new one!’ He was actually auctioning me off! I was so humiliated that my entire body broke into goose bumps. The crowd looked on amazed, and some boys even asked the sheikh how much he was selling me for. I was bathed in sweat from the shame of it.

He kept parading me about until we came to the convent of his holiness Sheikh Arslan. There he allowed me to renew my ablutions, after which we entered the shrine and he said: ‘Recite the Sura of the Emissaries.’ I recited it in a loud voice. ‘Recite the Sura of the Soul-Snatchers.’ I recited that as well.69 When I finished, he opened his hands and babbled a kind of nonsensical prayer. ‘This prayer nice, nice,’ he said, addressing me. He finished with: ‘Say, I ask forgiveness of God,’ and I replied: ‘Turn to God in repentance.’ Then he stood up and kissed my forehead, saying, ‘This tomb my master, you my child.’ Seizing me by the hand once again, he ushered me out of the convent. As we stepped outside, he kissed my shoes and placed them in front of me. I kissed his hand and put on my shoes, thinking, ‘What can I do? He is naked and crazy, and he has me in his clutches.’

We returned to the central marketplace. Dragging me along by the hand, he kept shouting, ‘O lookers, O nobles, this my son, despised, forgiven, for sale, a thousand thousand purses!’ He made a public scandal out of me; but I was not upset about it as I had been before. In this manner he brought me to the palace square and ushered me into the council hall, shouting the while. Then he delivered me to Murtaza Pasha, hand to hand, saying, ‘This my spiritual son.’ Once again he kissed me on the forehead, then departed.

As I was recounting the entire misadventure to Murtaza Pasha, seventy or eighty Damascus janissaries, accompanied by the municipal police chief, brought three dead men loaded on horses and seven or eight wounded men through the palace gate. ‘My lord,’ they said, ‘we raided a party of fornicators in a house in the Turkman district, not realising that they were your officers. They killed three of our men and wounded these others. Now they have walled themselves up inside that house and are fighting it out.’ They deposited the corpses in front of the Pasha and kissed the ground.

The Pasha leapt up like an eagle. ‘Call the treasurer!’ he cried. When the treasurer arrived he pummelled him mercilessly, wounding him with his dagger in several places. Then he mounted with his retinue and bodyguard and galloped off to the den of vice. A terrific battle ensued, in which three of the officers were killed; the other seven were brought back after the evening prayer, strangled, and buried along with the first three in the vicinity of Sheikh Reyhan.

The moral of the story is: I was on my way with these men to that den of vice. But because I am one of those who bear God’s holy word, having memorised the Koran, his holiness Sheikh Bekkar received a divine inspiration and seized me from the midst of those doomed men. He paraded me round about, crying, ‘One sinner!’ and so rescued me – may his secret be sanctified. Owing to that saintly man I was saved from that abyss.

6. The Hajj caravan; Muzayrib, the Hajj bazaar





First of all, the vizier Hüseyn Pasha, younger brother of the late Siyavuş Pasha, being governor of Damascus, was charged with conducting the Damascus pilgrims to and from the noble Ka‘ba. For it had been reported to the Porte that every year Arab brigands plundered the pilgrims and caused them great harm and loss. So Hüseyn Pasha was grand commander, and under him the sancak(-beys) and timar and zeamet holders of Damascus province, along with 500 Damascus janissaries and their officers.

Hoca Bekir Agha brought forty purses each from Kara Mehmed Pasha in Syrian Tripoli and Hacı İshak Pasha, governor of Sidon. When Hüseyn Pasha received these sums he disbursed them among his retinue. First he gave each of his twenty chief doorkeepers 300 guruş, five camels, one muleteer, one water carrier, and one torchbearer. The 100 individuals deserving of esteem, each 50 guruş; 100 müteferrikas, each 40 guruş 100 delis, 100 gönüllüs, 20 regiments of Segban and Sarıca troops, a total of 2,000 levend horsemen, each 100 guruş; those mounted on camel-litters, each 50 guruş; two regiments of Tatars, including 200 fully armed warriors, each 100 guruş; 50 each of saddlers, cooks, tasters, panters and tent-pitchers, each 50 guruş ; 30 players of the military band, five purses; 1,000 water carriers, 300 torchbearers, 300 muleteers, 1,000 camel-drivers, each 10 Venetian guruş; and 100 of his personal retinue, each 100 guruş. In short, a total of 5,120 men were given 270 purses. And 300 more purses were spent on provisions and other expenses.

On the (—) day of the month of Shawwal, he paraded the sacred litter of the Prophet around the city of Damascus, while all the pilgrims went about readying their provisions for the journey.

By God’s wisdom, on that day 2,000 Persian pilgrims arrived from the direction of Erzurum and Diyarbekir, with much wealth. They showered our lord Hüseyn Pasha with presents. He in turn appointed one of his officers over them. According to imperial kanun he got twenty gold pieces for each stop (? – durma) and fifteen for each man – a very helpful sum.

That same day he gave this humble one 200 fine coins (i.e. gold pieces); five camels, one riding-camel, one grey mare, four camel litters, one tent; one tent-pitcher, one water carrier, one baggage attendant, one torchbearer; ten guruş for each of my slaveboys. He appointed us a daily ration of two complete meals; four measures of fodder for my three horses; for breakfast every morning, five China bowls of whatever food is available; one candle; and other food and drink and other necessities. And he ordered that we pitch our tents in the shadow of his pavilion.

On the 20th of Shawwal in the year 1081 (sic. error for 1082 = 19 February 1672), with a besmele, we departed Damascus in grand procession with so many troops pertaining to that province; and the troops of the Emir of the Hajj, Harmuş Pasha; and the well-armed and well-ordered soldiery of the Pasha (i.e. Hüseyn Pasha) consisting of 5,120 men.

[…]

The grain pertaining to the imperial purse and belonging to the pashas, the Emir of the Hajj, the agent of the imperial pantry, and the other officials going on the Hajj, as well as the foodstuffs of the merchants, had been piling up here in storage for the past five or six months. All the Muslim pilgrims crossed the bridge over the Hurrayan River that flows here at the foot of the castle. This river originates in the east, in the mountains of Bosra, flows west and empties into the Lake of Minya.

After crossing, Hüseyn Pasha pitched his tent-pavilion along the river bank and the rest of the pilgrimage caravan settled down in their rows of tents. Criers went through the camp announcing a ten-day halt, until the beginning of the month of Dhu’l-qa‘da, and warning us to see to our provisions. We all busied ourselves making preparations for the journey. Day by day pilgrims kept coming from all directions, until the reckoning of tents and marquees stood at 6,300. For this was the Greatest Hajj and only God knows how many pilgrims there were.

In addition, outside the camp, there were 5,000 tents and huts belonging to tradesmen. This bazaar increased day and night. There were 300 bread shops, also cook shops and textile shops, so you can extrapolate from these. This humble one strolled from one end of the camp (i.e., the bazaar) to the other and it came to 8,000 paces. It was a sea of men, all jostling shoulders. Everything was for sale except the elixir of life, including silks and brocades and satins and other precious stuffs. In this bazaar, 40,000 or 50,000 Damascus pilgrims spend five or six Egyptian treasures and then get 40,000 or 50,000 camels from the Arab tribes. The Arab tribesmen get rich as well and come here once a year with their wives and children to buy precious stuffs. So it is a sea of men.

First of all, according to the kanun of Sultan Süleyman, the sheikhs of the following tribes bring camels to this plain of Muzayrib to assist the Muslim pilgrims: Bani (—), Al Umur, Al Rashd, Al Ribah, Al Ma‘an, Al Shahab, Al Turabi, Ibn Harfush, Ibn Hanah, Ibn Sa‘id, Bani Ibrahim, Bani Salim, Bani Ata, Bani Atiya, Bani Safar, Bani Zuhd, Bani Wahidat. Also the sheikhs of Nablus, Ajlun, Bani Zayt, Safed, Acre, Ramla, Gazza, Jerusalem and Khalil al-Rahman (Hebron).

In short, it is a kanun of Sultan Süleyman that the sheikhs of seventy-seven tribes come annually to this plain of Muzayrib with their followers to serve the pilgrims with 40,000 or 50,000 camels, for which service they receive sultanic gifts from the Damascus treasury. The plain becomes crowded with people, so everyone has to keep an eye on his own suite, because they will steal the collyrium from your eyes!

The pashas get 3,000 free-ranging camels from these sheikhs, 2,000 of which are for carrying water – four goatskins of water per camel – and 1,000 for barley and beans. In addition, the Pasha has 200 camel-trains for his other supplies and fifty mule-trains loaded with his own provisions. Mules actually bear up quite well between Damascus and Mecca. His personal retinue and some of his troops use thoroughbred mares as their mounts. But stallions do not bear up very well.

By God’s wisdom, while we were buying and selling and securing provisions for the journey in this plain of Muzayrib, on the 25th of Shawwal (24 February) at noon the air became thick and a storm arose that sent everyone scurrying for their lives. The rain fell as though the clouds had let down their hair and were weeping, and anyone with a tent or marquee or baggage was left moaning and sighing. That day and night it rained so much that no one could visit anyone else and all the tents were engulfed in the flood. When the Arabs saw the situation they gave up haggling and took shelter with their camels in some valleys outside the camp. Only a few stuck it out and stayed behind.

That night there was a wintry blizzard, with snowflakes the size of sparrows’ heads. Two hundred camels and seventy or eighty naked Arabs gave up the ghost. That night several thousand horses and mules, dragging their tethers and hobbles, turned their rumps to the desert wind and took refuge in the hamlets. In the morning we saw that some horses, mules and donkeys had disappeared. Praise God, none was permanently lost, but all the animals were returned to their owners for fear of Hüseyn Pasha.

That day the rain continued as though flowing out of a water-carrier’s skin. Horses and mules and camels were up to their knees in water and shivering like autumn leaves. The people were alarmed, crying ‘My lord, what is going on?’ Everyone was worried what would happen to them, since one in a thousand provisions for the journey was not yet ready, and only three days remained until the first of the month of Dhu’l-qa‘da.

Finally everyone piled up their clothing inside their tents and sat on them. I wrapped my three horses in kilims and felts, raced them over the ground (?) and turned their rumps to the wind. Nor did I deprive their heads of provender-bags filled with barley and straw. But the rain gave us no respite.

Now, by God’s wisdom, the mice that normally make their home underground had nowhere to find shelter except amidst the clothing piled up inside the tents, which they gnawed to shreds. Some of the horses that were lying on the ground had their manes and tails eaten up by mice, so those mature thoroughbreds were turned into immature foals. God knows, some of them that dozed off got their noses and ears bitten. This too was a calamity.

A contingent of pilgrim latecomers that had been left behind in Damascus, including the janissary colonel Ahmed Agha and the grand vizier’s son-in-law and superintendent of the doorkeepers Siyavuş Agha, got caught in the storm in the place called Sanamayn. They were separated from their goods and provisions, and some died of the cold. After suffering a myriad pains and troubles, and just escaping with their lives, they entered the camp here at Muzayrib, but there was no place for them to rest. Finally the Pasha took them into his tent-pavilion.

By God’s wisdom, that day a terrible wind blew apart all the tents. A man was assigned to hold down each tent-rope, but it was no use: the ropes were left in their hands and the tents, that had been pitched on the ground, were now flapping in the air.

So everyone was moaning and groaning. With bare feet, in concord complete, they came to consult Hüseyn Pasha in his tent-pavilion.

‘The rest of the pilgrims,’ they said, ‘have been unable to get here from Damascus. And the sheikhs of the Arabs have been unable to bring camels because of the winter weather. The Muslim pilgrims have been battered by all sorts of troubles and travails. Now the month of Dhu’l-qa‘da is upon us. Ahead of us are various stages of the journey. If we get behind schedule for a single day, the noble mahmil (the sacred litter of the Prophet) will not reach Arafat on time, and your noble reputation will suffer a breach. My lord, we must do something about this. The pilgrims from Damascus are drowning, they have suffered loss of life and property, and have been subject to pillage.’

‘Judgement belongs to God,’ replied the Pasha. ‘If the pilgrims are unable to go this year, well, the Hajj is not obligatory as long as the road is not safe. And my charge is not to convey the pilgrims, but rather to convey the noble mahmil and the two Egyptian treasures of the holy endowment (i.e., the surre, the Sultan’s annual gifts) to Mecca. If the mahmil of Egypt reaches there but the mahmil of Damascus fails to, that would be a stain on the honour of the Ottoman dynasty. How could my own honour otherwise be diminished? I will dismantle the noble mahmil, wrap it carefully, and load it on my mules, which are serviceable. By God’s command, I will roll three stages into one and reach the Ka‘ba on time. So whoever is able, let him join me in such a forced march; and whoever is not, let him go back. For concerning the Hajj, God has commanded in the glorious Koran, in the Sura of al-Imran: Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to God for all who can make the journey (3:97).’

Everyone young and old applauded this sentiment, saying it was the reasonable course, and a Fatiha was recited. Criers went through the camp announcing the plan. Seven grandees who were being conveyed in palanquins got off in Muzayrib and mounted horses. Four or five hundred pilgrims (with mounts) and quite a few merchants, also 600 miserable men on foot, went back to Muzayrib castle.

That day and night there was no let-up of snow and rain. It was a period of days that betokened Noah’s flood. This night as well the animals broke loose and took refuge in the hamlets, and again the villagers returned them – some naked, some wounded – to their owners.

That day the Pasha ordered his personal retinue to recite 1,000 Sura of al-An‘am (6) to ward off calamity. And to all the Muslim pilgrims he dealt out the assignment of reciting 200,000 blessings on the Prophet and 100,000 Sura of al-Ikhlas (112). By God’s command, as soon as the recitations began, the rain of torment stopped and the sun showed its head from the tower of the firmament. The men and the animals revived somewhat. But men and horses were mired in mud – judge what condition the camels were in! That night, the (—) of the month of Dhu’l-qa‘da, (? – lacuna in the text), the cannon was fired and the caravan set out – but how was this possible, seeing that all the baggage was waterlogged?





7. Medina





Description of the stage of Old Wadi al-Kura


It is also known as Old Medina. In a desert area, there are wells with fine drinking water, sufficient for all the pilgrims. The people who live in the flourishing villages that are in these wadis came to this place to offer their wares to the pilgrims for sale at a cheap price. In the afternoon the horns again were sounded and we continued on our way, passing over stony tracts and areas with thorn bushes and pebble stones and through narrow passes. After sunset, according to kanun – because of harassment from the infidels (i.e., rebellious Bedouin?) of the Khaybar region – the pilgrimage caravan was lighted with thousands of torches, resembling the stars in the night sky; it was as though the crescent moon had become full and it was as bright as day. Again according to kanun, the pilgrims were surrounded by Muslim soldiers and could proceed in complete security. The next day we continued from the time of the morning prayer until the mid-afternoon prayer, uninterruptedly like a flowing river. After walking about seventeen hours, without untying our loads, we came to:





Stage of Wadi al-Istiqbal and Dar Wada‘


It is also known as Dar Jurf. This place is surrounded by bare mountains. If one reaches this place from Damascus, the mountains seem to be as naked as poor Arabs. No trees grow here, only in the wadis there are numerous thorn bushes, date palms, acacias and toothpick trees. In Dar Wada‘ all the animals are fed on barley and beans. Since the entire population of Medina comes out to greet the pilgrims here after the muezzin has called them to prayer, it is known as Wadi al-Istiqbal (‘Wadi of Welcome’). The notables of Medina and the pilgrim guides, dressed entirely in white, men with beaming faces, wide-eyed, with sweet words on their lips, with glowing cheeks, courteous, gentle and good-tempered, came out with their gifts and went from tent to tent looking for their friends. Even those whose friends had died attached themselves to one or another of the notables and were honoured. They all said to Hüseyn Pasha ‘My lord, this year you have come seven days later than in previous years; but God willing you will reach Mecca safe and sound and be able to stay there an extra day.’ The pilgrims were cheered at this good news.

After a stay of two hours the drums sounded for departure. Time was short, since there was only one more day until Dhu’l-hijja (the month of pilgrimage). There are ten stages from Medina to Mecca, and with a stay of one day in Medina and one day in Mecca you need twelve days for this journey. The halt on Mt Arafat takes place on the 10th of Dhu’l-hijja. From fear of not arriving there on time, no rest was permitted from Muzayrib until this point except in Ula and Ma‘an and we marched for periods of twenty-five to thirty hours. Everyone kept on walking while munching on biscuit from his own scrip. Even the camels were fed their balls of dough while walking. We kept flowing like a human stream. This was the reason why so many horses, camels, mules and donkeys were left behind.

Also we did not stop at the usual pilgrim stations, but only when necessary. Under normal circumstances there are twenty-four stages between Damascus and Medina. This is about 350 hours riding on a camel. It is possible to cover this stretch on a horse or mule in 100 hours if the roads are well kept and supplies assured. But the roads are in poor condition and supplies have to be carried by camels, which also are fed from their loads. A person can satisfy hunger with a piece of bread; but it is not worth the trouble incurred because of the animals. If the authorities made an effort and kept good care of the road from Damascus to Medina, one could manage without camels and cover the stretch on horseback in comfort. May God grant ease!

Thanks to God’s providential care, camels are endowed with such strength that they can walk and sleep at the same time. And, as God is my witness, some of the torchbearers are as tough as Nakhchivan steel and they too can walk and sleep at the same time, while bearing torches on their shoulders. This is simply one of God’s amazing mysteries.

In short, we set off from Wadi’l-istikbal immediately. It is from this point that the guides begin to take their task seriously, pointing out the landmark mountains and valleys.

After one hour of travelling we arrived at the top of a hill. When one reaches this point and turns south one sees the orchards and gardens of Medina and the dome of the Mosque of the Prophet reaching to the sky. From the gleam of the gilded pinnacle on the dome, the plain of Medina becomes light upon light and one’s eyes are dazzled.

Here the sincere lover gets off his horse or camel or mule and says the following prayer: Peace and blessing be upon you, O Messenger of God; peace and blessing be upon you, O Beloved of God; peace and blessing be upon you, O lord of the first ones and the last ones; and peace be upon the apostles of God. This is a matter of love (i.e., not obligatory). If the pilgrim feels strong enough, he proceeds from here as far as Medina by foot, a five-hour downhill stroll. If he is handicapped or old, he remounts his horse or camel or mule or donkey and continues the journey, repeating again and again the noble blessings on the Prophet. There are many varieties of this prayer, but the following is short and practical: O God, bless Muhammad and his people! As soon as Medina comes into view and one sees the dome of the Mosque of the Prophet, one should not neglect this prayer: Intercession, O Messenger of God!

It is quite a marvel that when this hill is reached and the dome of the Prophet comes into view, and when the company of believers begins to cry out, a change comes over the animals as well. The camels that were exhausted suddenly regain their strength and grumble like thunder, the horses whinny and the mules and donkeys cry out in the segah musical mode: The harshest of voices is the braying of the ass (31:19). It is then impossible to hold the animals back, but they head toward Medina at great speed.

When the pilgrims have reached this hill and viewed Medina, some of the lovers put on the pilgrim’s robe and proceed barefoot escorted by some of the inhabitants of Medina. At Ali’s Well one does not have to wear the pilgrim’s robe nor say these prayers but only repeats the noble blessings on the Prophet. There is no obstacle according to the Sharia, however. If, out of love, one puts on the pilgrim’s robe here and does not have one’s head shaved, that is even more fitting. Would that poor, needy man always wore the pilgrim’s garb and turned to God; how much more fitting that would be, and how heavy his goods will weigh on God’s scales. For this reason many lovers of God will recite the following verse:

Let us abandon the crown of transience,



Let us be naked for a while.





To put on the pilgrim’s robe means to separate oneself from all things but God. Verse: The unmarried state is truly the greatest sultanate. For this reason the Prophet ordered putting on the pilgrim’s robe as a sign of separation from all that is worldly and as a form of turning to God. That is why many pilgrims come to visit the Prophet’s tomb dressed in the pilgrim’s robe beginning at this point.





Concerning the inhabitants of Medina


As soon as the city of Medina becomes visible, that plain is transformed into a sea of people and everyone, young and old and schoolchildren come to greet the pilgrims. Some children bind little baskets on palm branches to beg the pilgrims for alms. The pilgrims come on litters mounted high on the humps of the camels. The naked Arab boys reach out these baskets and say: Praise be to God, o pilgrims, go unhurt and in peace! May God accept your visit to Him! And the pilgrims say: Praise be to God, we have arrived at the shrine of our Prophet who came as a mercy for both worlds. They do not allow a single one to go empty-handed, as they believe them to be the neighbours of the Prophet.

The children accompany the pilgrims on their way to Medina, which takes five hours, and as they go they sing eloquent kasides (odes) and na‘t (poetry describing the Prophet). Some children, those with tuneful and melancholic voices, sing kasides in such a way that one’s flesh tingles with elation. And most of the womenfolk recite the noble mevlud (poetry on the birth of the Prophet). This crowd accompanies the pilgrims to Medina, and some of the pilgrims are carried on sedans and some on litters.





Praise for the soldiers of Sarı Hüseyn Pasha


From this point Hüseyn Pasha drowned his sea-like soldiery in blue iron (i.e., had them put on coats of mail). The Emir of the Hajj and the vanguard, then the Damascus army and the Pasha’s troops put on their golden uniforms and marched in procession. The entry of the great Sarı Arslan Hüseyn Pasha into the city was beyond description. Such a well-ordered and decorated and well-armed troop had not entered since the conqueror of Yemen, Sinan Pasha, Rıdvan Pasha and Tavaşi Süleyman Pasha. The prominent citizens of Medina gathered to receive these soldiers. The learned, the religious, the imams and preachers, sheikhs and descendants of the Prophet, young and old, rich and poor came out to greet them. The tradesmen set out their goods for sale, and hundreds of sheep and rams were slaughtered. There were crowds on both sides of the highway. Women, dressed in gauze and cloth-of-gold, ululated from the windows and roofs of all the houses, their voices reaching up to heaven.

The Pasha marched in with his horse-tail and banner and his spare horses, dressed in a sable-fur cloak and girded with a quiver. He had a turban on his head wrapped after the fashion of Sultan Selim. His runners were dressed in cloth-of-gold, wearing vests with pearl buttons, and on their heads were gold plates set with plumes. The canteen-bearers and musketeers wore red broadcloth and gold-embroidered felt cloaks, with jewelled muskets in their hands and gem-inlaid swords at their waists. The chief canteen-bearer held a canteen decorated with precious stones, the likes of which I had never seen even belonging to a vizier. One hundred of the Pasha’s personal retinue sat on full-blooded Arabian horses, each worth 1,000 guruş, and was adorned with gilded saddle bags and a tall headdress. Each Aga was drenched in sky-blue armour wearing a turban made in Baghdad. The swordbearer and footman, with their quivers of gold-embroidered silk and their breeches and gold-stitched felt hats on their heads, accompanied the Pasha as he paraded past. After them came the banner and flag, then the military band in rows of eight. They beat the Muhammadan drum and stopped at the vizierial tent. The people of Medina were utterly astounded at this, as they had never seen such a magnificent vizier.

After the Pasha had taken his seat in his tent-pavilion, seventy to eighty cannon shots were fired from the towers and ramparts of Medina castle. The surrounding plain reverberated at the sound. From the place where Hüseyn Pasha drew up this procession, one could see Medina to the south and Mt Uhud to the north. This lofty red-coloured mountain will be described in due course. It was from here that the Pasha entered Medina in formation. As for this humble one, deeming it more fitting to visit the pilgrimage sites than to participate in the procession, I took a slaveboy and a guide and mounted my horse.

[…]

While in the suburb I went straight to the (—) Bath where I bathed using a clean bath-glove and soap. Then I came to my tent, took off all my travel garments, uttered a besmele, and put on the pilgrim’s garment. Barefoot and bare headed, free from all worldly attachments, I became a roselike dervish.

I immediately left my tent and entered the walled city of Medina through the Egyptian gate. At this point one must recite the following verse: Lord, grant me a goodly entrance and a goodly exit, and sustain me with Your power (17:80). I went straight to the shrine of the Prophet, that mercy for the worlds (21:107), and entered through the Gate of Peace (Bab-ı Selam). I did not go on foot like the other lovers, but lay my sinful face on his precious ground and crawled in, fishlike, without using hands or feet. Thanks be to God, there is mercy among men, as is expressed in the proverb: ‘No one treads on the face of one who lies on the floor.’ In the crowd of forty to fifty thousand pilgrims I made my way through to the railed precinct müvacehe of the Messenger of God. There I kissed the threshold, prayed beseeching, and knelt down. As I bowed humbly I spoke the following words: Peace be upon you, O messenger of God. I prayed for his intercession and I nearly fainted. When I came to myself, I completed a Koran-recital that I had left off at the Sura of al-Ikhlas (112) then retired backwards according to etiquette. God willing, the form and manner of the visit will be explained in detail in the proper place.

From there I returned to my tent and took something to eat. The sergeants at arms announced a halt of two days and two nights. Then the noble vizier held a divan. The eight-layered military band played. When that was finished, all the notables of the province had an audience with the Pasha. After coffee, sherbet and rose water, and after fumigation with incense, the Arab highwaymen who had been captured on the way were brought to the place of execution in chains.

‘Let no one be put to death in the shrine of the messenger of God,’ said the Pasha. ‘Give them over to the warden of the castle.’ The warden was immediately summoned. Then all the notables of the province came forward – the religious scholars, pious individuals, and foreign residents – and asked for the release of the condemned men.

‘I know how they should be forgiven!’ said the Pasha. ‘Who went to summon the warden?’

Now among these men was one in janissary dress with a magnificent sable fur. ‘My lord,’ he said, ‘I am the warden.’

‘So it’s you, is it?’ As the Pasha rose to greet him I saw that his cheeks were flushed and the hair of his beard and moustache were standing on end. ‘Hey, warden, who are you in fact?’

‘I’m a janissary.’

‘So you are a servitor of the Sultan?’

‘Yes,’ the fellow replied.

‘Damn you!’ said the Pasha. ‘Don’t I have a chief doorkeeper and a captain of the janissaries? You could have spoken with them and they could have reported to me. You are a servitor of the Sultan, yet you come hobnobbing with these foreign residents and sit here without a qualm. I call for the warden and you just stand there! Where did you let your beard grow grey? Remove this infidel! Shut him up in the tower with these Arab infidels!’

The warden was handed over to the chief canteen-bearer who confined him in the tower and made his deputy warden in his place. After watching all this, I got my weapon from my tent and put it in my belt, then began to visit the Pilgrimage sites and tour the city and the castle.

[…]

In 959 (1552) it was under the rule of (—) Sherif and governed on his behalf by another sherif at the rank of sancak-bey. The decree was issued by Mehmed IV that whoever was the Sheikh of the Haram should be the ruler of Medina. The subordinate governor was dismissed. It was further decreed that the Sherif would come once a year, lodge outside Medina, and visit the grave of the Prophet; and would not interfere in any way in the affairs of the city.

The Molla in Medina by ancient statute received a salary of 500 akçe per diem. Nevertheless, because it was such an unprofitable place and so far away (from Istanbul), it was not considered a prestigious mollaship. However, Sultan Mehmed issued a law according to which no one could become a molla in Istanbul if he had not already been a molla in Mecca and Medina.

The reason was that this Medina is a very unprofitable place and a haunt of dervishes. There are no arguments, disagreements or differences of opinion. The inhabitants are all good-tempered, honest people. If there is a legal claim required to be registered by the kadi it is resolved quickly and easily, then everyone says a Fatiha and the parties go their separate ways.

At present, 1,000 gold pieces from the imperial surre and 200 bushels of wheat from Egypt are set aside for the Molla and the same for the Sheikh of the Haram. The Sheikh of the Haram runs the government with about 500 soldiers and the Molla decides cases with forty or fifty men saying ‘This is the judgement of the messenger of God.’

[…]

Inside the walls are 2,000 four- or five-storey tall houses, some small, some larger, well-constructed and decorated, the roofs completely covered with lime. Most of the public buildings are hans, mosques, medreses, water dispensaries, soup kitchens, dervish convents, primary schools, Hadith and Koran schools. There are no other prayer houses or mosques inside the walled city, they are all outside. There are many markets and also some public baths.

Among the houses there are no orchards and gardens or public squares. Only seven houses have courtyards; the rest are packed layer on layer. Within the city walls there are a total of five quarters and (—) prayer-niches. There is another small mosque in the citadel where the soldiers perform their ritual prayers. For from fear of bandits the fortress is continuously garrisoned and never left empty. This citadel is the soul of Medina. The entire contents of the treasury and all its wealth are secreted inside it.

In the city there is an iron gate which faces eastward and in front of which is a large assembly hall where the watchmen are stationed. Moreover there are weapons decorating all the walls of the fortress. In the assembly hall a lofty dome covers a vast arena paved with marble. In the centre of this arena is an elegant pool and water jet, whose water is drawn by means of a water wheel. All the watchmen, young and old, perform their ritual ablutions from this pool and station themselves around it. This hall is used regularly by the castle warden and the other notables for meetings and council assemblies.

No one from outside is allowed into the fortress, only they do let in Muslim pilgrims. But Arab tribesmen are strictly prohibited from entering.

In the citadel there are no markets, hans or baths, only a few grain bins, an ammunition store and seventy to eighty small houses. It is a very strong and resistant citadel. Its mosque is very well built, the construction dating from the time of Sultan Süleyman. The other small mosques in the outer fortress are not very spacious or imposing. It is only in the Great Mosque where sermons are preached.





Description of the Mosque of the Sacred Garden


The noble grave of the Prophet, that light-filled garden which is the aim and goal of all the community of Muhammad, may be found in this mosque. Since Friday prayers are not performed in any other mosque within the Medina fortress, this mosque (The Mosque of the Prophet) attracts a large congregation. Especially during the Pilgrimage, it is hard to find a place to kneel. It is a grand mosque and it would be hard to find such a spiritual house of prayer in all the seven climes of the Islamic lands. The former rulers, for the sake of the Prophet, made it so well-constructed and adorned and jewel-like as though it were Paradise itself. It is indeed a paradise, for concerning this mosque there is a sound Hadith: The area between my pulpit and my grave is one of the gardens of paradise.

[…]

The mosque together with the courtyard measures 800 paces in circumference from the outside. But the area in front of the wall on the prayer-niche side has a garden and one of the city quarters, so one enters through the Gate of Peace from where, as one respectfully passes by the Prophet’s grave, it is 200 paces as far as the Umar Corner of the mosque. By this reckoning, the circumference of the mosque measures 1,000 paces.

From there one continues to pace off the mosque from the inside, past the foot of the Prophet’s grave, Gabriel’s Gate, the forecourt of the Sheikh of the Haram and the Gate of Healing. It is 170 paces from the interior of the courtyard to the area in front of the oil magazines. From the corner of the oil magazine through the courtyard as far as the corner where the barrels for the soup kitchen stand, it is 150 paces. From there one again crosses the courtyard, passes the Gate of Mercy and returns to the Gate of Peace with 170. By this reckoning, the interior of the mosque measures 690 paces, the outside 1,000 paces.

The courtyard is completely covered with pebbles. It measures 600 paces in circumference. There is a lofty cupola in the centre where the olive oil is stored that is used for the many lamps in the mosque; the oil comes from Sousse in the Maghreb to Egypt and then via Yanbu to Medina.

In front of this oil-cupola there is a small square terrace surrounded by a railing. Here there is a date palm reaching to the sky. The Prophet planted it with his own hands. Next to it, by God’s will, a sapling date palm is sprouting. Precisely this spot was the courtyard of the house of Abu Ayyub Ansari. It is now the courtyard of the mosque.

There are terraces on all four sides of this courtyard and, in due order, fifty-two varicoloured precious lofty pillars, of white marble and porphyry and ‘honeycombed’ marble, such as are found in the Dome of the Rock. Around the courtyard are fifty-two finely-constructed arches, and between every two arches the names of God are written in Karahisari style calligraphy.

Around the courtyard are three minarets stretching up to the sky. Each is finely constructed and well-proportioned and has three balconies. One of these minarets, at the Umar Corner, points upward like a stylus, architecturally very impressive. Another, outside the Gate of Mercy, rises over the gate of the Sultan Qaytbay Medrese; this too is a noteworthy minaret and station of Bilal for giving the prayer-call in the uzzal musical mode. The third, in the corner on the northern side of the courtyard, is a large minaret built in the old manner, not as finely constructed as the others.

This noble mosque is completely covered in (—). In the compass of the mosque there are a total of 300 columns, large and small. Above the columns are 300 arches with twenty (—) each, like so many rainbows. And above these vaults are the coloured ceilings, so masterly executed that even Mani and Bihzad and Arzhang could not paint this ornamentation with their brushes of hair. It is so magical and wonderful, that even after so many centuries it still shines with the glimmer of gold and azure.

Above the precinct of the Prophet’s grave are six small stone cupolas, each decorated on the inside like a Chinese picture gallery. When the sun shines through the windows all around these cupolas, the inside of the Prophet’s tomb becomes light upon light.

The pillars of the mosque, which the Prophet built first and which Uthman extended, as far as the Gate of Peace, are a man’s height and covered in green tiles. But the columns of the gallery around the courtyard are bare. Between the buildings added on by Uthman and the old Prophet’s mosque, as far as the Gate of Peace, and between the columns, are varicoloured lattices, some of cypress, some of walnut or acacia wood. In the wall built by Uthman is an ornate prayer-niche. No one is permitted to pray here since the old mosque of the Prophet lies beyond it and the pulpit is also there. The building by Uthman has simply become the courtyard of the Prophet’s mosque. Some people perform two prostrations here as they believe their prayer will be answered.

The courtyard is not covered with straw mats since it serves as a public thoroughfare from the Gate of Peace. However, the master builder paved this courtyard with small precious stones as though it were Indian inlay-work. It is so overlaid with raw marble and jasper, porphyry, etc., that one is dazzled by it.

The floor of the Prophet’s mosque is completely covered with rich gold-embroidered carpets bestowed by many different rulers and viziers. It is a mosque of divine light. By God, if I were not so besmirched with worldly affairs and not so inclined to travel, I would not budge from this mosque. Thousands of people, indeed, have withdrawn from the world and become foreign residents in this mosque, worshipping before the grave of the Prophet.

The muezzins’ gallery is made of pure white marble and stands on eight slender columns. All around it is an enclosure decorated with ornamental marble work.

Close by the grave of the Prophet is the lowly prayer-niche of Imam Hanafi. This is also decorated with tiny stones shining like birds’ eyes and is one of the most beautiful prayer-niches that I have ever seen. It is flanked by golden candlesticks as tall as a man, and on these are eight white wax and camphor candles, each eight cubits high, stretching upwards like a pillar and so thick that a man can just put his arms around it. They come from Egypt and shine like the light of God.

To the right of this prayer-niche Sultan Murad III had a lofty pulpit built of finely-wrought marble, the like of which I have never seen in any house of prayer in all the Islamic lands. It embodies the spirit of this mosque of the Sacred Garden. These verses are written on the elegant door of the pulpit:

It was the will of Sultan Murad, son of Selim, to set up this pulpit.



He prays that his reward may be multiplied in Heaven.



Sa‘d says: As for its chronogram and date:



A pulpit built by Sultan Murad.



Year 1002 (1593–4)





Also to the right of this prayer-niche are the niches of Imam Shafi‘i, Imam Malik and Imam Hanbali. They are also elaborate prayer-niches. The five daily prayers are performed first of all by the Shafi‘i school, then the Hanafis, then the Malikis, and finally the Hanbalis. The muezzins, however, do not leave the gallery but wait until the Shafi‘is are finished and then call the members of the other three schools to prayer.

The chronogram under the arch on the inside of the Gate of Peace: Sultan Sultan Qaytbay ordered this sacred building to be constructed. May God multiply his success, in the year (—). It is a richly ornate door, made of shining brass, the work of a goldsmith. People who see the door believe it to be made of gold.

The four gates leading into the mosque – the Gate of Mercy, the Gate of Peace, Gate of Healing and Gabriel’s Gate – consist of finely-worked brass and are polished the colour of amber. When one enters through the Gate of Peace, on the left hand side in the corner is a calligraphic inscription at the height of a man on a blue paper plaque in large letters, as follows:



The custom of the Arabs: if someone is a great prince



It is usual to let slaves go free at his graveside.



You who are the pride of the world and prince of this world and the next:



God forbid that he who rubs his face on your grave should not go free.





This is very suitable, demonstrating poetic skill like that of Hassan (ibn Thabit); may God bless you a hundredfold.

And when you come through the Gate of Peace, you see on the right-hand corner at the height of a man, the following verses from the Koran: I take refuge in God from Satan the cursed. In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. He who founds his house on the fear of God and His good pleasure (9:109); Their Lord has promised them joy and mercy from Himself (9:21); and from the same Sura: None should visit the mosques of God except those who believe in God and the Last Day (9:18). And the verses continue in clearly legible gold writing as one moves towards Uthman’s prayer-niche. From these texts to the paved work below, the wall built by Uthman is covered with a varicoloured mosaic of porphyry and jasper green marble. Over these decorated stones Victory/al-Fath (Sura 48) is inscribed in another layer of clearly legible gold writing, all the way from the Gate of Peace to Gabriel’s Gate. It must be the calligraphy of Yaqut Musta‘simi – but God knows for sure —as it is an ancient inscription and the style is close to his.

With regard to the repair and maintenance of Uthman’s wall, in the Shafi‘i corner on a square piece of white marble is the following chronogram:

He is the intercessor at the place of resurrection and the place where the Archangel Gabriel was sent down;



Leader in prayer of all the prophets and crown of the heads of the mystics.



By God’s grace this chronogram has been made with a benediction:



God grant that he flourish in both worlds.



Year 1043 (1633–34)





On this wall built by Uthman there are no windows except for one window with brass bars, at half the height of a man, in the precinct before the Prophet’s grave. Outside it is a rose garden of Iram with roses, hyacinths and sweet basil. And there is another window in front of the railings at the foot of the prophet’s grave that looks out onto the main street. Apart from these there are no other windows in the mosque, so it is like a castle guarded on four sides. It really is a castle within a fortress, like a jewel in its setting.

Inside the mosque, in front of the Sheikh of the Haram pavilion is the bench of the People of the Bench (Arbab-ı Suffa – a group of pietists during the lifetime of the Prophet). This is another place of worship, a terrace facing the grave of Fatima within the railings of the grave of the Prophet.

Above the iron railings on this side there are calligraphic plaques by thousands of scholars. Thanks be to God, I too, lowly Evliya, have written in clearly legible writing a plaque saying, Seyyah-ı alem Evliya ruhiyçün el-fatiha (For the spirit of the world-traveller Evliya, a Fatiha). There is some more calligraphy of mine, on the wall in front of the aforementioned railings of the Prophet’s grave, in large letters reading: ‘Intercession, O Muhammad, for Evliya (or, for the saints). Year 1082 (1671–2).’ Moreover I set up a crystal oil lamp as big as a turban beside the others.

These oil lamps were made in Egypt. There are 7,000 all together. They are lit every night by the mosque servants and by their light all the residents and visitors can read the Koran and engage in religious discussions until the morning prayer.

If I were to write everything I know about this mosque it would fill a very thick volume. The reason why I did not describe the fortress first of all was to inform you that the mosque of the Prophet is right in the middle of the fortress, and where the Prophet’s resting place is in this mosque.

Description of the interior of the Sacred Garden and account of how we entered the tomb of the Prophet with our patron, Vizier Hüseyn Pasha


First you must put on clean and ritually pure clothes and constantly recite the noble greetings upon the Prophet. The Sheikh of the Haram and twelve of his black eunuchs are girded in white cotton loincloths. These aghas of the Haram are saintly men at the level of the Pole of Poles. They have dedicated their lives on behalf of the Prophet – black eunuchs who have given forty or fifty years of their lives to this service. They each carry jewelled censers and rose-water sprayers with which they approach the gate of the railing of the grave of the Prophet. First the Sheikh of the Haram girds the Pasha with a white loincloth and gives him a besom, i.e. a broom.

In sum, there were seven of us altogether, including this humble one, who entered the sanctuary. With us were the viziers, deputies, ulema and other religious dignitaries, town notables and sweepers. Their representatives reside here in Medina. The sweepers’ deputy of the Ottoman Sultan is the Sheikh of the Haram himself. He also takes a broom in his hand and praying and praising, opens the noble gate of the Prophet’s railing from the direction of the grave of Fatima. The twelve eunuchs and the deputy sweepers enter and close the gate of felicity, after which no one is allowed inside the Sacred Garden.

All the sweepers are trustworthy people. They too are allowed into the Sacred Garden once a year by the black eunuchs. For the rest of the time they sweep the outer mosque and kiss the Ka‘ba cover. Entreating Fatima’s intercession, they recite a Fatiha for her spirit and enter crying, ‘O daughter of the messenger of God!’ For one reaches the grave of the Prophet by going past the grave of Fatima. They burn incense of aloes, ambergris, camphor, hyacinth and dressed aloes. Crying ‘Allah!’ with tearful eyes, they proceed until they are at a level with her felicitous head and burn pastilles of raw ambergris.

The marriage of Ali to Fatima took place in the second year after the Hijra. Fatima was eighteen years old and Ali was twenty. He was a courageous youth. After the wedding night he killed Abu Jahl and seventy of his followers in heroic battle and took captive the Prophet’s uncle Abbas and the Prophet’s cousin Uqayl ibn Abi Talib along with seventy other deniers. Later many of them converted to Islam and so became Companions of the Prophet. After the death of Fatima, mother of Hasan and Husayn, her grave was made within this railing at the feet of the Prophet.

All visitors to this place outside the Sacred Garden perfume their brains with the incense and cry out: Intercession, O Messenger of God! The Pasha and this humble one kissed the ground and prayed for the intercession of the Prophet. We then began to sweep the noble pavement. The black eunuchs assisted with their seven lamps. The deputy sweepers swept once or twice each and removed the sweepings. We and fifteen others were left there; but I was drained of energy, intoxicated and bewildered from love. I asked for help from his noble spirit and my senses revived enough to light three more lamps.

A large netting is suspended beneath this lofty dome. It is a pavilion of cloth-of-gold and set with jewels, worth several Egyptian treasures. No emperor has possessed its like. No one may enter within this netting, for the Beloved of God himself lies here in a sarcophagus covered with a green embroidered Ka‘ba cloth. This pavilion of the messenger of God contains numerous precious and bejewelled items – candlesticks, oil lamps, censers, rose-water sprayers, and the like – sent as votive offerings by sultans, viziers, deputies and great notables. These have accumulated from the death of the Prophet up to this date of 1082 (1671–2) and are heaped up inside the pavilion, not suspended. Only God knows how many items there are. It is for this reason that no one is allowed within the curtain; it is reserved for the Prophet. But once a year some of the more pious servants are permitted to enter and clean the dust off.





8. The People of Mecca





It is not concealed to men of discernment that, as recorded in the Kıyafetname of Akşemseddinzade Hamdi Çelebi (d. 1503), the people of Mecca are dark skinned, some of them reddish or brownish, with eyes like gazelles, sweet speech, rounded faces, keeping their own counsel, gentlemen of pure Hashimite lineage. But because of the hot climate they are very skinny. They are not much versed in the crafts, and do not have the ability to work with heavy loads; rather, most of them are merchants, while another class get by on the charity of the Sultan.

The majority of Meccans, being of a melancholic humour, are not very sociable. They are rough spoken in their trade dealings and in conventional discourse. If you wish to buy some merchandise from them it is customary to ask the price. They will say, for example, ‘Ten guruş.’ You may think it appropriate to bargain and counter with eight, but if you do, they will flare up and demand fifteen. If you say nine they will say twenty, and stubbornly stick to that price. That is how contentious they are. Among themselves, on the other hand, they join hands under their sleeves and engage in dumb barter over prices by squeezing with conventional signs, like the Pythagoreans. So it is better to just give the first price they ask, since they won’t engage in bargaining and they eschew ill-gotten gains.

Indeed they are very fine gentlemen, all of them pure in lineage and descendants of the Prophet. However, because of their rebelliousness during the reign of the Egyptian Sultan Qaytbay (reg. 1468–96), the Sultan made a surprise attack on Mecca with 12,000 piebald horsemen and put all the sherifs in chains. He exiled most of them, retaining only seven noble seyyids inside Mecca. The sherifs agreed that henceforth they would not wear green turbans but only white. They also agreed not to mount horses with docked tails, to put on their saddle cloths front to back, and to mount barefoot. This agreement is still in force, although in the course of time the sherifs returned and Mecca is now full of them. But they never wear green turbans.

As for the rest of their attire, they use splendid Indian silks, plain white shirts with embroidery, zaği and mollayi stuffs, weaves and germsud and hümaşahi and mohair cloaks of various colours, which they proudly prance about in. From their white turbans in front and back they let down Muhammadan turban-ends, each a Meccan cubit long.

Some wear varicoloured precious Kashmir and Lahore cottons. The reason is that the sherifs receive such items as gifts from the emperors and notables of India. From the Ottomans, on the other hand, they mostly get grain.

The Meccans never wear trousers but rather baggy pants and beddavi shirts. On their feet they wear Circassian and cimcime shoes and slippers. A scarf of Kashmir cotton around their neck is de rigeur. They put kohl on their eyes, following the Sunna of the Prophet, and put henna on their hands and feet and beards.

They never eat greasy foods, only coffee and hard bread, beans, olives, dates, sweetmeats, sherbets, pilavs and soups. They are very abstemious. If they eat too much they cannot digest it, because the heat anyway roasts a man. Living so abstemiously they are very healthy, so healthy that there are no physicians in Mecca; if one does come he cannot make a living and moves elsewhere. The people of Mecca also abstain from sex six months of the year because of the heat. One day they go to the summer pasture known as Wadi Abbas …. (? – lacuna in the text). They do not light fires, except for the merchants and the sherifs.

They are 100 per cent Shafi‘i. Some … (? – lacuna in the text) are called Zaydi. (They are thought to practice) mut‘a marriage. This is an arrangement whereby a man on a campaign or journey can contract to have sexual relations with a woman for up to one month for one guruş. At the end of the month he pays the fee and goes elsewhere. If he has to stay more than a month he contracts with the same woman for one guruş or five guruş, or else with a different woman, and they can do what they will. This is called mut‘a marriage. It is said to have been the practice in Mecca in olden times, and the Meccans are reproached for it, but in our day I have not been aware that it is practised. It is a vicious slander. They are gentlemen of pure religion. And they have little boys who are charming and clever; as in the verse:

When he walks he is spirit in form in motion;



When he talks he breathes life like the words of Jesus.





The people are well-born, high and mighty individuals. They don’t like the Turks who sojourn in Mecca. The Turks (on the other hand) are quite comfortable in Medina, where indeed most of them live and where the sherifs hardly have any influence.

The clay of Mecca is so fine and delicate that they fashion from it all sorts of jugs and pitchers which they use for the water of Zamzam.

The women here are known for their beauty and grace; with fairy faces and angel looks, like the moon at mid-month or like garden peacocks; and with gaits like skipping partridges; pure virgins and mature matrons who are clearly the object of the Koranic verse: You may marry other women who seem good to you: two, three, or four of them (4:3). They are the source and origin of mankind. They too wear fine fabrics and put on jewellery from head to toe. On their heads they wear caps of gold and silver or else cloth threaded with gold, wrapping a black silk cover over that, and they cover their radiant faces with veils of multicoloured silk so that one sees only their gazelle-like eyes daubed with kohl. They are very covered-up women.

But there are also Ethiopian slavegirls, actually singing-girls, tawny as raw ambergris, who set hearts aflutter. Some dance in public in the coffee houses. They are the pride of Arabia and no cause for shame. They all wear light-blue stockings and blue slippers. If a woman passes by a man of God, his brain is suffused with the perfumes of musk and ambergris and civet. One day as I was going to visit the shrine of Sufyan al-Thawri (scholar of early Islam, d. 778) I ran into a flock of women. It turned out to be a wedding procession. One of the maiden girls was drowned in gold bangles. Even from a distance of ten paces my brain was suffused with fragrances. More than 500 schoolboys followed the procession crying Amin amin! as they made their way to their destination.

[…]

But the Meccans, being of a melancholic and saturnine disposition, are not much engaged in learning. They are all merchants. The study of Hadith and the memorisation of the Koran are rather Egyptian specialities. In Mecca it is only some of the Turkish sojourners who engage in the religious sciences; other than that, Mecca has no reputation for it. Also one does not find saintly individuals engaged in mystical exercises and performing miracles as one finds in other countries. The reason is that, being of melancholic humour, they are more given to frivolity and also to building activities. The multi-storeyed buildings here are not to be found in Aleppo or Damascus or in Iraq, though one does find them in Cairo.

Another quality of the Meccans is uxoriousness. They are in thrall to their wives: whatever their wives tell them to do, they do. In this respect, the men are the wings of the women. You never find a Meccan who is prominent for courage. They only put on fine clothes, apply henna to their feet and beards, go from coffee house to coffee house, then go home with a coffee mug in one hand and a biscuit in the other and fall asleep on their pillow sipping coffee and munching on biscuit.

For food and drink they completely rely on the marketplace. Since they are in thrall to their wives, nothing gets cooked in their houses. The women themselves are slow and heavy. They never do any work, never wash laundry or spin yarn or sweep the house. All their needs are supplied from the marketplace.

These are very extravagant people; but since they possess the wealth of Korah, they spend freely and indulge in magnificent clothes and furnishings. That is how it has been over the generations. My aim (in reporting this) is not to reproach them in any way – God forbid! I have only recorded the facts.





9. Uyun al-qasab





Stage of Uyun al-qasab: In Arabic it means Sugar Cane River, or else Sugar Well, there being wells of fresh water. It is under the rulership of the sheikhs of the tribe of Awlad Salih Nabi. If something gets lost, one has recourse to them. We stayed here for one hour and gave the camels fodder, then the trumpets were sounded and we set out again at noon.

By God’s wisdom, it was my fate on this noble Hajj to travel hurriedly toward Mecca with the Syrian caravan, and then, on my return, to again travel hurriedly with the Egypt caravan. In fact, while the Syrian caravan is always in a hurry going to Mecca, its return journey is leisurely. The Syrians enjoy a stay of twenty days in Mecca and twelve in Medina, and they have long stops at the stages on their return journey, not entering Damascus until the month of the Prophet’s birthday (i.e., Rabi‘ al-awwal, three months after the Hajj). The Egyptians, on the other hand, take their time going to the Ka‘ba, walking leisurely between stages for eight or ten or (at the most) fifteen hours, then enjoying a stay of twenty-five days in Mecca. But on their return journey they walk fifteen or seventeen hours between stages, have only two days in Medina, and sometimes in their haste join two stages into one to get back to Cairo as soon as possible. For this reason it is well-known among the pilgrims that you should go with Egypt and return with Syria. In my case, I had to go in haste from Syria and return in haste to Egypt. Nevertheless, God be praised, I went with pleasure and returned with pleasure.

The Egyptian pilgrims do have one good practice. For the five daily prayers, the guides have watches and whenever it is prayer time – whether on hill or dale or wherever they may be – the caravan stops for what is termed rada. They make the camels kneel, everyone dismounts and performs the prayer. They give fodder to the camels and horses, and they themselves have a meal and rest for one hour, with an elaborate coffee-service.

But every night (!) until the rada halt for the evening prayer they make the camels kneel with their loads and they sleep like the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus and enter the Valley of the Silent as though following the dictum Die by God’s command! Even the camels and the other beasts lie sprawling and snoring in the sand, because the road to Egypt is very secure.

Then the guides in the front raise their banner, beat their kettle-drums and set off. It takes an hour for the news to reach the rear guard and for them to set out as well. For the roads to Egypt go through narrow ravines. This year, with the two caravan trains travelling side by side, the length from one end to the other was 87 steps (or degrees? – derece). Because it was a year of the Great Hajj, the caravan was very large.

These halts, which are called rada, are not made by the Syria caravan going to Mecca because that road is not secure, there are many Arab brigands. The Syria road is, however, a broad plain and summer pasture. Four trains of palanquins can go side by side, flanked by three trains of free-ranging camels, and guarded on the extreme right flank by the Emir of the Hajj’s Jerusalem and Nablus soldiery and on the extreme left flank by the Damascus troops. And they travel night and day, because the stages are very far from one another. So they only halt long enough to perform the ritual prayer and then go on. But the streams of water are sweet, and the roads are open plains. And on the return trip they do proceed by leisurely rada halts.

The Egypt roads, in contrast, are rocky, with hills and valleys, and the streams of water are bitter. There is security, however. The caravan is surrounded by seven regiments of troops: the Emir of the Hajj’s deputy with the Circassian soldiery on the right flank; the Emir of the Hajj’s troops in the rear; the sipahis and gönüllüs on the left flank; and the guards, azeb troops and gunners with the treasure and the cannons, all fully-armed and mounted on imperial dromedaries and camel mares. The Bey of Azlam with six cannons guards the rear. The Egyptian caravan has no rear guard until the Azlam troops arrive; but the Syrian caravan has an obligatory rear guard.

There is another good custom that is due to the cheapness and abundance of foodstuffs among the Egyptian soldiery. When they make the rada halts for the five daily prayers, they light the torches and, in the middle of the night, offer coffee to any and all comers. They hand out sweetmeats and sugar, stuffed pastries, hazelnuts and peanuts and walnuts, dates and roasted chickpeas, pastries and candies, so freely that God knows, everyone’s pockets are filled with enough candy and nuts to munch on while walking the next day.

There is a contingent of bedouin Arabs, known as Ibn Halwan – forty men with red shawls. One hour before the caravan reaches a stage, this group of men go to a nearby high point and cry: ‘O pilgrims! God be praised, the blessed stage is near!’ When the pilgrims hear this they become cheerful. Even the camels, that had been exhausted by the trek, become like seven-headed dragons when they hear this cry, and go so fast that those on foot cannot keep up with them.

In fact, before this cry, some of the camels trek on with their heavy loads while they are sleeping. I have often witnessed this, and God knows I am telling the truth. Even some of the men – the torch-bearers in particular, with wood on their backs weighing 15 or 20 okkas, and bearing a lighted torch on their shoulder – walk in their sleep or sleep while walking, a very strange sight. But camel-drivers observe that camels are often asleep while walking, and when they come to a rocky or difficult spot they cry out Idak, idak! to the camels who suddenly wake up and get past that difficult spot. At such rough places the tent-pitchers and water-carriers and torchbearers beat their drums and tambourines crying ‘God save the Sultan!’ and clap their hands and make jokes as they proceed on the way.

They travel until morning, avoiding settling into a stage in the dark of the night. For when that happens, a hue and cry rises among the troops, everyone has trouble finding his regiment and finding his train with all the backing and forthing. So they wait until morning to call a halt and make the camels kneel.

There is another fear that keeps them from reaching a stage at night. There are, to be sure, no rebels or bandits on the Egyptian roads that would carry out a night raid. But the pilgrims are afraid of thieves among the camel-drivers and tent-pitchers and guards and water-carriers and military musicians and torch-bearers; and especially the pickpockets and sharpers and spoilers who come along with the Azlam soldiery. These people will separate an entire camel from its train, with its load and a sleeping man on top, then waken the man and strip him and sneak away with the camel and the load. Many such losses have been incurred in the dark of night, and Egyptian pilgrims have to be on their guard against these house-thieves. That is why the caravan does not stop at night.





10. St Catherine’s Monastery on Mt Sinai





Description of the stage of Mt Sinai


In the (—) language they call all mountains tur. Examples are (Tur Hiraven) near Ayn Tujjar, the Mount of Olives (Tur Zayta) in Jerusalem, and this Mt Sinai (Tur Sina). It is a lofty mountain, from the summit of which one can see the minarets of the ruined city of Madyan of the prophet Shu‘ayb. Mt Aqaba is visible below, and one can also make out the waves of the Red Sea, although Mt Sinai lies amidst mountains a distance of three hours north of the sea.

Because Moses and Jesus both spoke to God without intermediary on this mountain, Ptolemy Alexander built a great monastery at its very summit, unmatched in its beauty. Indeed, compared to the embellishment here, the ornamentation in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and in the church in Bethlehem is a mote in the sun.

It has over 1,000 monks and patriarchs and priests and liars from twenty-six nations of the Christians. They practice such austerities and false fasts that they turn into Ahlat skeletons, and for their unholy breakfasts consume a date or olive or almond and a cup of milk. Votive offerings come here from throughout the Christian world. There are immature Magian boys and lovely kaladite (?) youths who service any and all comers day and night.

The kitchen of Kay Kavus in this monastery has over 100 cooks who will prepare whatever food you desire. Even bird’s-milk and soul-water can be found in their pantry. There are numerous monks, but ever since the reign of Selim I, the Greek infidels have been in charge.

There is a nine-arched dome illuminated day and night by an oil-lamp. We asked the nasty priests for permission to tour it. They would not let us in. We cited the verse:

Yesterday I went to see you in church



But the monks would not let me in.



I swear that on Judgement Day



I will complain about you to Jesus.





Out of fear of Jesus they opened the door of the sky-coloured dome and we went inside.





Stations of Moses, Jesus, and Mother Mary. And, east of these, Station of the Apostles: twelve stations. All these shrines are so embellished that one cannot express it with tongues or record it with pens.

Their water is mainly from cisterns. They also haul up water from below with donkeys.

When God revealed Himself to Moses on this mountain the voice of the Lord of Power broke it asunder and all the trees and vegetation were burned. The following Koranic verses were revealed about this: And when his Lord revealed Himself to the Mountain, He levelled it into dust. Moses fell down senseless (7:143). The tree which on Mount Sinai grows gives oil and a condiment for men (23:20). And when He revealed Himself, the gamam – i.e., cloud – descended upon this mountain. Even now, traces of those events are sometimes visible. In short, it is a wondrous shrine.

However, it has remained in the hands of the Christians. But were it in the possession of Islam, it would be in ruins. The infidels have made it prosperous, and strive to maintain its endowments. They keep on good terms with the authorities by giving presents to the governor of Egypt, the notables of the seven regiments, the Agha of Suez and the Arab sheikhs. They even gave this humble one a leathern tobacco-pouch that smelled like musk and ambergris. And the Frankish patriarch gave me a watch.

I also received patents (papintalar, safe-conducts) from the seven patriarchs, to the effect that: ‘He is a world traveller, he has visited Mt Sinai, no one should hinder him in his travels to the country of the Seven Kings.’

I wanted to go to the castle of Tur and from there to Suez, but they dissuaded me, saying the roads were too hard and I would not be able to catch up with the Hajj caravan. Seeing that it was a small castle on the seacoast, I thought I could at least tour it. So I walked down from Mt Sinai in the company of a few of the monks. We went through a broad valley with rose gardens and orchards … apples, pears, pomegranates, quinces, and grapes … that are shipped to Suez and from there to Cairo, providing that city with cheap fruit.

There are streams flowing in these orchards that empty into the Red Sea at the foot of Tur Castle. All the Suez ships stop here to take on water, and also to transport water to Suez where a single waterskin sells for ten para. They gave me a lot of fruit and I hurried back. It turned out that the pilgrimage caravan had left the castle of Nahil and we met in mid-journey in the moonlight at midnight. Toward morning a rada halt was announced. I distributed the Tur fruit among the brethren of purity, and pleased all my friends.





VOLUME TEN





Egypt and Sudan





EVLIYA’S FINAL VOLUME, covering the last ten years of his life, is devoted to Cairo and journeys along the Nile. His description of Cairo, the second great city of the Ottoman Empire, provides a survey, full of anecdotes and asides, on a par with his account of Istanbul in Volume 1. And again we find chapter divisions – a feature found only in this and in the first volume.

Evliya dwells on the unusual customs of various groups whom he meets in Egypt – snake charmers, beggars, the Hadari fellahin with their elaborate wedding ceremonies and an Arab tribe that claims to have sex with crocodiles. He explores the inside of one of the great pyramids. He attends the colourful mevlud of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi in Tanta. (With regard to the acrobatic performances, cf. Volume 4, selection 2 for similar entertainments in Anatolia. The festive atmosphere of these mevluds has its counterpart in the fairs of the Balkans; cf. Volume 8, selection 10).) Even more than elsewhere, Evliya gives very rich descriptions of the animal world in relation to the people: snakes and crocodiles, domestic fowl and migratory birds (cf. Volume 8, selection 1), elephants and monkeys.

Evliya had a special interest in the Nile, as attested by the surviving map of the Nile in the Vatican Library that can be attributed to him. His journeys along the Nile take him as far as Alexandria to the north and the land of the Funj in Sudan to the south; and there is an excursion to Ethiopia and the Red Sea coast. As is the case with the Kalmyks earlier, Evliya’s description of the Funj is rich in fantasy – if thus we should interpret his encounter with two Bektashi dervishes and their unusual mounts.

Evliya relates events in Cairo up until 1683 and concludes by claiming that he has retired into obscurity after fifty-one years of travel.





1. Adam’s prayer for Egypt in ‘Hebrew’





Adam’s first earthly home was Sarandil (or Sarandib, Ceylon, Sri Lanka). The second was Mt Arafat. The third, by God’s leave, was Mecca. After dwelling there for some time he had, according to the chroniclers, 40,000 sons. Every year he and his descendants used to circumambulate the Holy House and perform the Hajj. But since there was no sown land in Mecca, they had difficulty feeding themselves. So, by God’s command, they migrated to Egypt and settled on the bank of the Nile. This was their fourth home.

In Egypt sowing was so easy and crops were so plentiful that one grain of wheat produced 100 ears and every ear 100 grains, as attested by the Koranic verse each bearing a hundred grains (2:261).

At first Adam and his descendants all lived together in Egypt, and this is the prayer he recited. It is in the Hebrew language, because when Adam fell from paradise, in his rebellion he forgot the language of paradise, which is Arabic, and instructed by Gabriel he began to speak Hebrew instead. I record here his prayer for Egypt (or Cairo – Mısr) which I got from the Coptic chronicles:

Hidam My God

tıt jedilem My faith

huji çiji riba Preserve from the devil

felaj riba felaj riba Save me, save me

şujüm jaken All your angels

tarj dilem şerij tena May they serve me

sıja riyeji zehriba Give wheat I’ll make bread

jedilem jiraj jiraj In the end death occurs, death

Hidam kidam My God

hirj bijti jar binti For my sons this my city

jari mjni jar mjni Make prosper, make prosper.





Such is Adam’s prayer for Egypt in the Hebrew language in the meter müfte‘ilün. That is why first of all lands Cairo is so prosperous, a city that is half the world.





2. Relation among Nile overflow, plenty and poverty, crowdedness of Cairo, people and donkeys





Because God blessed Egypt with the Nile, there is great abundance and an accumulation of imperial wealth (or tax money). This wealth is assured as long as the Nile overflow reaches 18 cubits. If it reaches 20 cubits, then the Pasha, agents, tax farmers, provincial governors and peasants all become rich. If it does not reach 18 cubits, then – God save us! – the land is not watered and dearth and famine ensue, the agents and tax farmers are cut off, imperial wealth is not produced, the Pasha is forced to make up the loss to the treasury out of his own pocket, and he in turn wrings it out of his subordinates.

There are 300,000 holders of religious offices – imams, preachers, ulema, sheikhs, descendants of the Prophet – who demand their salaries, amounting to two Egyptian treasures, from the supervisors of endowments. If they don’t get their salaries, there is a public uprising. But if there is abundance in the land, then their salaries are forthcoming and they shower benedictions on the Sultan and the benefactors.

{But if the Nile rises above the point indicated in the geomancy of Muhyiddin-i Arabi70 by the phrases The water was equal to the wood and From the mountain to the mountain, if the overflow is three cubits too high, then Cairo becomes flooded. This actually occurred during the governorship of Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha (1669–73), when one could see the Nile flood from the threshold of Demirkapu and from in front of the Ibrahim Gülşeni convent, and the Cairo populace was alarmed.}

In short, there is no city in the entire world, let alone in the Ottoman Empire, that is such a sea of men and with such productive land as this. Cairo is called Mother of the World, because if the whole world is suffering dearth and famine, Egypt can feed it; but if, God forbid, Cairo suffers famine for a single day, not all the world’s crops could sustain it. For Cairo is a sea of men.

In particular, when this humble one in the course of my travels arrived in Cairo in 1082 (1671–2), 800,000 men had died of plague that year, according to the court records of the four Sunni rites. In fact, there was one village whose tax farm was taken over by the state and in the course of two months Ibrahim Pasha sold it to nine different men for twenty purses each. Despite this loss of life, the markets were so crowded that one could not walk through without jostling shoulders.

In Cairo, flocks of animals – horses and mules, camels, cows, water-buffaloes, sheep and goats – roam about in the marketplace. And donkeys are so numerous that they have taken over the city. One can hardly pass through the streets because the donkey drivers are constantly shouting ‘Behind you! On your side! In front of you! On your right! On your left!’ Sometimes they pick out naive Turks for abuse, crying ‘Give way, Efendi!’ and trample them with their donkeys.

The first temcid one hears in Cairo is the braying of donkeys, in the segah musical mode. If one donkey in its stable starts to bray in the middle of the night, then – in accordance with the Koranic verse The harshest of voices is the braying of the ass (31:19) – there is braying in Cairo for the next two hours, making one think that doomsday has come and the antichrist has emerged.

All the notables of Cairo, and even the womenfolk, ride donkeys. You see women on donkey-back – with silver harness and velvet saddle-cloth and the donkeys dyed with henna – riding as far as Özbekiye (Azbakiya) and Salibiya and Old Cairo (Fustat) and Bulaq and Qaytbay, crying ‘Behind you! On your side!’ and shooting jereed (!). And this is not considered shameful, because the donkey is Egypt’s caique and ferryboat.

There was a certain Ali Bey from Girga who had 40,000 donkeys, each of which earned him 10 para a day for carrying grain. He is famous throughout Egypt. And it is certain that the Emir of the Hajj, Rıdvan Bey, had 40,000 camels. Even now it is impossible to pass through the streets of Cairo because of the water-carrying camels and donkeys.

There are twelve festivals a year in Cairo, which will be described in due course; on those days especially it is impossible to move in the marketplace because of the crowds of people and the crowds of donkey drivers and camel drivers. It is a sight worth seeing, part of the glory of the city!

70 Evliya frequently cites geomantic and onomantic prognostications wrongly attributed to Ibn Arabi (d. 1240); see Dankoff 2004, 103.





3. Snake medicine and snake charming





Description of the preparation of the greatest electuary, the theriac of Faruq


Let it be known to intelligent travellers that in every country throughout the world there are physicians who make the theriac of Faruq, but they cannot make it like the Egyptian kind. The tablet of Faruq is peculiar to Egypt. One should understand that the term ‘tablet’ in the first place refers to something that is extracted from the body of a snake.

There are forty persons receiving salaries from the endowments of this hospital of Sultan Qala’un who are charged with providing this service once a year. They are a guild and reside in the villages of the Habiroğlu in the district of Giza. Once a year in the month of July, they hunt the snakes from which the theriac of Faruq is made.

When it is the proper time to hunt snakes, they gather together and put on clothing of thick felt from head to foot. They even cover their faces; only their eyes are visible. They attach pieces of white felt to long sticks and head for Bahnasa, the Fayyum and Jabal Akhdar. They reach the place where the Faruq snakes are found in the cool of the morning when the snakes are indolent before being warmed by the heat of the day. Even in that condition it is a great struggle to catch them.

Having caught several thousand, they put them in baskets that are smeared with Faruq, and the snakes become intoxicated and bewildered. While the snakes are in this state, they sew up the openings of the baskets.

It sometimes happens that while struggling to catch the snakes, one of them will spring at the face of a hunter. If it strikes him in the eye he cannot be saved and falls a martyr to this profession. For they are deadly poisonous snakes. If they bite a camel on the ear or a mule on the hoof, they kill it instantly.

Hunting these snakes is reserved for the above-mentioned individuals. No one else is able to carry out the task. By God’s command, the members of their guild belong to the Sa‘diye brotherhood; but they are very upright individuals.

This group caught a great many snakes, loaded them in baskets on donkeys, and took them to Cairo. On the way, near a garden of Iram called Basatin, one of the snakes escaped and bit the donkey carrying its basket. The poor donkey collapsed head first, and in the twinkling of an eye its body swelled up to the size of an elephant. When it died, each leg had turned into a huge pillar. Some of the hunters drove away the people dwelling nearby, saying that the carcass of the donkey would split open and they would be ill affected by the stench. They removed the baskets of snakes that had been loaded on that donkey and placed them on another one. As this was going on, the carcass of the poisoned donkey split open and everything, even the bones, dissolved and flowed away. Thank God no one was harmed. The people who were there immediately piled dirt over the carcass of the donkey and buried it. They brought the cargo of snakes on the other donkeys to the hospital of Qala’un and turned it over to the chief physician and superintendent.

This humble one had previously asked the chief physician if I could watch the process; so now they sent me word. I immediately mounted my horse and went to the hospital of Qala’un. They opened the door of the Faruq chamber and let me in, then barred the door. They do not normally let in outsiders because it is a dangerous place, full of thousands of pitiless snakes, and also because they want to keep their knowledge secret, on the grounds that The Evil Eye is a reality.

This Faruq chamber is a large medrese. Walls and floor are covered with varicoloured raw marble. It is a medrese devoted to the science of medicine. All around the courtyard are terraces which on that day were covered with carpets.

We were some thirty people all told, including the chief physician, the superintendent, the secretary of the endowment, the administrator of the endowment, ten assistants of the chief physician, the reciter of prayers, and twelve snake-hunters, cooks and butchers. There was no reason for anyone to knock on the door and want to come in. Still, they barred the door firmly and told me not to fear. I got up on a low stool which they used to light lamps and got ready to watch. All thirty people arose, performed an ablution and two prostrations, then brought out their tools and equipment.

First, there were 100 blocks of wood, each three spans long. In the middle of each was a gevele nail, one span in height. There were 100 sharp meat-cleavers, like so many swords of Zahhak, the backs of which were made of thick Frankish iron. There were 100 large glazed earthenware crocks, large enough for a man to fit inside. Some were full of water, others empty. There were several tinned trays from the time of Qala’un (Mamluk sultan, reg. 1279–90); one ardeb of finely sifted salt; and some fifty large vessels, like earthenware water jars, glazed inside and out, but with wide bases and mouths big enough for a man to put his head in.

Everyone readied these copper and earthenware vessels. When the reciter of prayers stood up, all those present also rose to their feet. After the besmele and praises of God and blessings on the Prophet, he mentioned in order the Ottoman dynasty, the benefactor Sultan Qala’un, the Physician Loqman, Pythagoras the Monotheist, the Sultan of Physicians Abu Ali Sina (Ibn Sina, Avicenna), and the spirits of the other physicians. He then prayed for the safety of those present, mentioning the chief physician, the superintendent, the secretary, the chief cook and all the assistants and servants. After the prayer he said ‘God is great’ and recited a Fatiha, and we touched our faces with our hands.

Now the old chief hunter and three snake-butchers cut open the top of one of the twelve baskets that were standing in the middle of the courtyard. Great God! Some thousands of merciless snakes with poisonous fangs slithered out. I was stupefied with fear, although I was watching from a high perch. Some of them jumped as high as a man to the left and right. Hissing and whistling, they threw themselves at the wall.

While the terrified snakes were leaping about, the chief physician’s servants joined with the snake-hunters and prodded them inside yellow cloaks that were smeared with Faruq, and they all quieted down. The chief hunter and three butchers sat themselves next to the post-blocks mentioned above with cleavers in their hands and took the snakes out of the cloaks one by one.

One type of snake to emerge was small and white, with an intoxicating musky smell. These the hunters put in their bosoms. I asked the chief physician about them, and he said, ‘That is the musk snake. It is not used for making Faruq, but for other medicaments. You’ll see shortly.’

As I observed, they collected together all these little white snakes and arranged them on a long red silken cord, hanging by their throats. The cord was tied to a shaded place in a corner of the medrese and stretched from wall to wall. Using cotton, they dripped some Sousse olive oil into the mouths of the snakes, at which they died and began to swell up. The snakes would remain hanging this way for forty days and nights, the snake skins granulating into musk like cardamom seeds, with an odour so sharp that it makes one’s nose bleed.

Another type of small snake was short and mottled, with rounded heads like half of a walnut shell. The men set these to one side as well. When I inquired about them, the chief physician said, ‘They are called snake of Adam the Pure and are descended from the snakes that were banished from paradise along with Adam. These too are not used for making Faruq, but for other medicaments.’

He searched through ten baskets of snakes and set aside the musk snakes and the round-headed snakes of Adam the Pure. The latter, like the Faruq snake, does not hatch eggs but gives birth like other animals, by God’s wisdom and contrary to the nature of snakes.

Then they counted the Faruq snakes that were left. There were 8,300, large and small. There were handed over to the administrator of the endowment, and the secretaries and instructors recorded in ledgers that there were 800 guruş worth of snakes.

The chief snake-hunter and three snake-butchers were seated at the post-blocks. Uttering a besmele and the intention of healing, he took out a large snake from the cloak, put the middle of the snake on the nail of one of the blocks, and holding the head and tail together with his left hand, struck once with the cleaver in his right hand. The body of the snake, minus head and tail, began to squirm about the marble floor, while head and tail remained in the chief hunter’s hand. He used the back of the cleaver to crush the snake’s head and left it on the floor, saying ‘Declare God’s unity.’ All those present shouted, ‘There is no god but God!’

When he cuts a snake, he does so holding it stretched out and leaving behind four inches (lit. three fingers) of the head and tail. Another butcher takes the body of the snake and slices open its abdomen with a golden knife, extracts the intestines and eggs, and throws it to a third butcher who, pulling on the snakeskin with his fingernails, flays it from end to end. Apparently the skin was makeshift to begin with, so now the white flesh easily slips out. But the snake is still writhing!

With this the job of the butchers is done and the snake falls into the hands of the physicians. The chief physician’s assistants take the peeled snake, wash it thoroughly in the aforementioned crocks, and put it into one of the glazed jars, adding salt. When these jars are full they place them on the fire. The chief physician holds a watch. They burn acacia wood under the jars, and the fire becomes extremely hot.

Meanwhile everyone is in a state of fear and reciting litanies. Sometimes when they remove a snake from the cloak they spit into its mouth, so the snake is intoxicated and bewildered, then they put it on the log and chop it. In this manner the twelve hunters and butchers kill ten baskets of snakes.

As for the heads and tails, they fill large apothecary bottles with them and save them to make other medicaments. I persisted in questioning them about this, but they refused to answer. From what I understand, however – and God knows best – they extract the poison from the heads and send them to Frengistan. Because one time a gift of 1,000 snake heads strung on a cord was brought to the king of Dunkerque. He was pleased with the gift, took the snake heads off the cord, and gave them over to the Graf.

If the butchers do not strike accurately while killing these snakes and one tiny part of the head or tail is still slightly attached to the body, the chief physician immediately leaps from his place and cries out, ‘irmi, irmi al-hayya’ meaning ‘Throw it away! Throw away the snake!’ (Once) they did not throw the body of the snake with its head in with the intestines and eggs of the other snakes, but they put it in a place apart. That snake immediately swelled up as big as one’s arm, although it was originally only as thick as one’s thumb. The improperly severed head had affected the body and it swelled up. So (whenever the head was improperly severed) the chief physician immediately cried out and had them throw it away. They also discarded the log and cleaver that were used and brought out different ones. By God’s wisdom, on that day seventy-five snakes from ten baskets were not properly killed and the men threw them all away along with the implements. The discarded snakes are not charged on the account of the endowment; rather, they are charged against the account of the snake-hunters and butchers and the cost deducted from their fees. It is an amazing spectacle.

Another noteworthy event occurred that day. When the skins and intestines and eggs of the butchered snakes had piled up like mountains, the snake-butchers regrouped and sprinkled some of the aforementioned sifted salt on this snake-rubbish. As this was going on, one of the butchers withdrew his hand and gave a heart-rending sigh. The chief hunter immediately spat onto the fellow’s injured finger, brought three of the snakes that had been washed in the crocks, and wrapped his finger with them. The three snakes immediately swelled to the size of a man’s arm. He removed them and wrapped the finger with three more; they did not swell up, but they did change colour, and were also removed. Now the chief hunter took the fellow’s finger into his mouth, sucked at the wound and spat a yellow substance on the ground. They rubbed a bit of Greatest Faruq on the fellow’s finger. The pain subsided; the man was saved from being poisoned.

Apparently the head and tail of one of the snakes being killed had not been properly severed in a single blow and were accidentally left amidst the snakes’ eggs and rubbish. Then, while the butchers were sprinkling salt on the snakes’ eggs and innards, some poison from that improperly severed snake got on that fellow’s finger. They treated him as I described and saved his life.

In sum, I never saw such hard-hearted and cold-blooded men as these snake-hunters and snake-butchers – I wonder if they should even be considered human beings. To be sure, I witnessed a remarkable scene; but at every moment I nearly took leave of my senses, and I began to regret having come to watch. Now I asked the chief physician, ‘You have salted the skins and innards and eggs of these snakes and pickled them in jars to preserve them. What will you do with them?’

‘What are you after? Don’t ask!’ he said. I persisted and questioned him again. Finally he answered, ‘There are Frankish bailos (i.e., ambassadors from Venice and other European states) here. They purchase these jars from us and take them to the physicians of Frengistan, who use this substance to treat various ailments. They treat every limb of the body in a different manner, and this substance is very effective.’

They put the cleaned and salted snakes into twelve glazed earthenware jars, placed the jars on the kitchen hearths in one corner of the courtyard, and burned acacia wood under them to make the fire extremely hot. The chief physician had his staff in one hand and a watch in the other. The cooks were again his students, having mastered the sciences under his tutorship; the chief physician was only present to watch the time. The snakes boiled for three hours. An amber-like yellow oil appeared at the top of the jars. The chief physician took up a ladle, spooned out yellow snake oil and filled the large apothecary bottles that were there. Once again they made the fire very hot under the jars – please note that the vessels used to cook the snakes are not copper saucepans or kettles but, as I mentioned, earthenware jars glazed inside and out.

Next the chief physician weighed the snake oil, that he had spooned out with the ladle, against olive oil that comes from Sousse in the Maghreb – it is the finest olive oil, like Water of Life. He filled the bottles with five okkas of snake oil and five of pure olive oil, then put them over a low heat which they later increased. After three hours the oil took on the consistency of clarified butter and the fragrance of musk and raw ambergris, perfuming the brains of those present. I was impatient to learn what it was for, and again questioned the chief physician.

‘To tell you the truth,’ he said, ‘there are an enormous number of people in India with leprous conditions, and this oil is very beneficial for that climate. If it is rubbed just once on the bodies of those afflicted with such diseases, by God’s command the malady disappears and they become as clear-skinned as pearls or eggs. But it has no benefit here in Egypt, even if it is rubbed on a thousand times. On the other hand, in Egypt, if you make those suffering from mange or palpitations swallow one dram of it for forty days, by God’s command they are cured.’

They cooked the snakes in the jars for three more hours and boiled off one span of water, then removed the jars from the fire and put the shredded snake meat on large copper trays to cool. The snake broth left in the jars was for local consumption. For the past month, bowls and ewers and copper buckets had been arriving from the Egyptian notables along with prescriptions, and these were now taken out of the cupboards. The name and illness of each patient were written on a piece of cloth wrapped in paper and attached to each vessel. They filled the bowls and buckets with that snake broth, sometimes adding other medicaments according to the illness, and returned them to their owners. Thus, the snake soup went to hundreds of places.

Their work complete, all the assistants filled dishes with snake soup, crumbled some bread on top, and sat down to eat. I nearly took leave of my senses. The chief physician, superintendent, secretary and other servants also began to drink the snake broth by the cup. They brought me a cup too. I refused it, but the chief physician and superintendent were insistent, ‘Truly, my lord, it is very invigorating. It increases the faculty of vision and eliminates the odour of haemorrhoids.’

‘It is God’s to command,’ I said, mustering my courage. ‘A trouble shared is a trouble halved.71 They drank it, so I’ll drink it too.’ I closed my eyes and gritted my teeth, uttered a besmele with the intention of healing, and drank off a cup. It smelled like musk. They brought another cup, in which, with the tip of a knife, they put a small amount of the snake oil mixed with the aforementioned olive oil. I drank that too. God knows, that musky smell did not leave my brain for an entire week.





On the benefits of snake broth. I described above how we were attacked by Arabs on the night we were approaching Badr-i Hunayn after departing from Mecca.72 During that period I was quite anxious and my body became feverish. Praise be to God, I drank two cups of this snake broth and within a week not a hint or trace of the malady remained, my body turned to pure silver, and I was well again. I experienced other benefits as well.





My adventure. One such benefit relates to something that occurred to me in the year 1056 (1646). I was with Tekeli Mustafa Pasha at the siege of Şebenik (Sebenico) castle, one of the Venetian strongholds on the Bosnian frontier. After pounding the fortress with cannons for forty days and forty nights we were unable to conquer it and retreated, making camp in the place called Danilova. There we were surrounded by 200,000 Uskok (Christian Bosnian) and Carinthian and Frankish and Croatian infidels and had a great battle that lasted seven hours. The Ottoman troops were routed and the infidels began to massacre the Muslims on one flank.

At that period this humble one was travelling with the janissary regiment as commissary, and before my very eyes the infidels put my seven slaveboys and 380 companions to the sword. I abandoned all my money and goods and galloped off on an Arab steed that the grand vizier Kara Mustafa Pasha had given me. The infidels pursued me round about that endless plain, but were unable to catch me and eventually lost track – God the Preserver hid it from them.

When night fell I was in a desperate state. Abandoning my horse, I entered a forest with my sword and quiver and bow case and spent seven days and six nights in the mountains, with no companions but birds and wild beasts, and subsisting on roots and berries. But going on foot with quiver and bow case and sword, and 80 Venetian guruş and 150 ducats in my waistband, exhausted me. Finally I removed the arrows from the quiver, took the bow by the handle, put the quiver and two hand-guns and the waistband with the guruş into the bow-case and buried it under a rock, leaving sword, guns and waistband in trust to God. Lightened of my load, I came to a stream, performed an ablution and two prostrations of prayer in need, and sought spiritual aid from all the prophets and saints.

While in this bewildered state, I overheard a conversation in Bosnian:

‘Bre Meho!’ (Hey, Meho!)

‘İşo veliş?’ – i.e., What do you have to say?

‘Hodamu sinko, hodamu’ – i.e., Come here, dear son, come!

When I heard these voices speaking Bosnian, my spirits revived. Still, I had anxious thoughts. Weren’t all the people in these mountains Croatian Uskoks? They had submitted to the infidels and put the Ottomans to the sword. Might not these voices belong to them?

It turned out that they were father and son who had come to the mountain to cut wood, and when it was the time of the noon prayer they recited the call to prayer, so I knew they were Muslims. I came forward and greeted them, and we became acquainted.

‘Welcome,’ said the old fellow in (Turkish in) Bosnian dialect. ‘Are you all right? What are you doing in these mountains?’

‘I’m with a few friends,’ I replied. ‘We know these mountains. We came up here to hunt. We’re janissaries from Livno castle.’

‘Do you have any news about the routed army?’

‘They were routed a week ago and fled to Kinin and Livno castles.’

‘It’s fate,’ he said. ‘And how did the infidels take Kilis castle?’

As for this humble one, I was at death’s door and charged with guarding the castle of my body. To make a long story short, we became friends and I accompanied them at a leisurely pace toward Glamoch castle. As we approached we ran into the castle warden. I related the entire sad story to him. He immediately had one of his servants dismount and bid me mount instead. I wept with joy, giving God a thousand praises. Two hours later we entered Glamoch Castle in procession and I stayed that night as guest in the warden’s house.

The wonder is that there was a Muslim castle one hour from where I was, but in my fear I spent seven days with foxes and jackals and rabbits and deer as my companions and bedfellows.

In the morning I requested the warden to lend me ten horsemen, saying that I had left some friends in the mountain among the rocks and wished to search for them. We went back into the mountains by the same roads we had come out, straight to the place where I had left my quiver and guns and waistband. Saying that I had to pee, I gave my horse to the guides and went ahead. I turned over some rocks and took my weapons. The strap of my quiver had been eaten by a fox or a jackal, but I somehow attached the quiver to my waist along with my waistband, into which I stuck my hand-guns. Praising God, I rejoined my guides, mounted my horse, and returned to Glamoch Castle in an hour.

I stayed there as guest for seven nights. By God’s wisdom, one night, in my sleep, I had something like a nocturnal emission and awoke with lumbago. Gobs of blood mixed with pus and seminal fluid oozed onto the bedclothes for an hour. I was ill for another seven days.

When I recovered, the castle warden, Mehmed Agha, gave me a horse and a suit of clothes, and I got presents from the other officials as well. Out of consideration, they gave me a servant and several men to accompany me. We reached Tekeli Pasha in the Livno plain, and my spirits revived. But I found not one of my friends; all had been martyred at the hands of the infidels, who had taken Kilis Castle and massacred the soldiers garrisoned there. But Tekeli Pasha had raised a general levy and begun to protect the province and its populace. When we met, he gave me a horse and a suit of clothes. Our acquaintance was ancient, he having known (?) Melek Ahmed Pasha’s father-in-law and Kaya Sultan’s mother.

To come to the point – One subject leads to another – after the ejaculation that occurred on that night in Glamoch castle, this humble one lost sexual potency; I did not even have any nocturnal emission. And I was despondent, thinking that my progeny had been cut off. Now, twenty-seven years later, I came to Egypt and drank two cups of snake broth with oil on the day of Faruq in the Qala’un hospital. That night I had two nocturnal emissions in succession. In the morning I went to the hospital and told the whole story to the chief physician. He gave me ten okkas of snake broth and one canister of snake oil and olive oil mixed. I used the snake broth for five or six days and became so healthy that I could break hazelnut shells on my flesh, so hard had my body become. I experienced other benefits as well.

In short, the chief physician distributed this snake broth to all the people (who had left their vessels and prescriptions), and the snake stew that they had cooked was cooling on the trays. The chief physician sat down at the trays with his students and attendants. They all washed their hands thoroughly, rolled up their sleeves, and one by one took some snake stew in their hands. From the back of each snake, from both sides of the spine, which they call the backbone, they extracted long cordlike strings as thick as the handle of a pen-sharpener. The length differed according to the size of the snake that was cut.

This is what is termed the ‘tablet’ of the theriac of Faruq, which is the Great Theriac and is drawn out from the snake-meat like a string. Each snake produces just one tablet weighing one miskal. All this toil and trouble, all this fear and anxiety, is for the sake of tablets weighing one miskal each. None of the other parts of the snake that are cooked are used for Faruq; they are thrown away, or given to the poor to eat, or else are buried in some out-of-the-way place.





An enjoyable anecdote for sex addicts. Some of it was once given to a man who was no longer able to have sexual intercourse. He ate snake stew and then had sex five or ten times with his wife. She became annoyed because he could not get enough. The next morning she presented a cohabitation suit in court. As plaintiff, her complaint was: ‘God forbid it, I cannot endure this affliction!’ As defendant, he admitted: ‘I ate snake meat and had sex ten times.’ The kadi reconciled them to having sex twenty times (a day?). Those who heard of this suit wanted to drink snake soup as well, and prayed: ‘O God, make it possible!’

In short, they pounded the meat extracted from the back of those snakes with wooden mortars and pestles, pulverised it into a paste, and weighed it on a scale. At this juncture it becomes a white ‘greatest electuary’ and is called ‘viper’s tablet’. Now all the medicaments are passed through a fine sieve and weighed out in precise amounts, then mixed with the viper’s tablet together with pure Anatolian honey that has been repeatedly boiled.

Every year they cook three cauldrons of theriac of Faruq. First they send two jars of it to the felicitous sultan and one jar each to the grand vizier, şeyhülislam and chief physician in Istanbul and the molla of Cairo as gifts. The rest they save for the superintendent of Qala’un’s endowment; it is dispensed to the bed-ridden patients in the hospital according to their illnesses.

The theriac of Faruq is exported from Egypt to Turkey and Arabia and Persia and Frengistan – in short, to the seven climes. It is produced in the manner described. They usually cook it once a year, but while this humble one was in Egypt, the chief physician, being the perfect master, cooked it three times a year.

As for the white snakes of Adam the Pure, mentioned above, their number exceeded 1,000. The medrese where the theriac of Faruq is made has a small room fitted with glass panes and a cord stretched from one corner to the other. The chief physician hung those white snakes in a row along this cord, attaching them one by one by the tail with red silk thread. Struggling for their lives, the snakes bit one another and, formerly thin and white, they all swelled up as thick as one’s arm. Now they closed all the windows of the room and went out, shutting the door behind them. When they opened it forty days later, the snakes of Adam the Pure had shrunk and become like thin strings. Even the bones were now black as cardamom seeds, having turned into a narcotic – the odour deprives a man of his senses, making him intoxicated and dizzy.

As for the snakes with the round head like half a walnut shell that we described above, the snake-butchers cut them in two and pickle them with their speckled skins. The halves with heads are strung on strings, the tails are buried in the ground. After 40 days they dry out and turn red. Then they are taken (off the strings and out of the ground) and kept in lead canisters. Otherwise they would be eaten by ants, since snake meat and human flesh are very tasty.





A wonderful anecdote. The fact that human flesh is tasty is something I witnessed among the Kalmyk cannibals in the Kipchak Steppe. They eat the corpses of their dead, and they also strangle and eat some of their poor Nogay captives – they do not cut their throats, so as not to lose their blood, but just strangle them, cook them and eat them. The Kalmyks claim that there is nothing tastier than human flesh, snake meat, and pork; and the tastiest part is the pig’s tail and the ‘tail’ or coccyx of humans. There are in fact many men of the Kalmyk persuasion in Turkey who know of this taste. But I myself can testify that human flesh is tasty, for if a man kisses his beloved just once, he finds eternal life and is overjoyed. That is how I know that human flesh is tasty.

To sum up, anyone who goes to Egypt and does not see how this Greatest Faruq is made has seen nothing remarkable on the face of the earth. That is all on this subject.

In Egypt, if a snake invades your house or pigeon coop and the tranquillity of the home is disturbed, you find one of these snake-hunters and, of course, pay him a few para. He enters the house and shouts once at the top of his voice, then blows a whistle that he carries at his waist and makes a hissing sound with his mouth. The snakes immediately begin to appear from various places. They raise their heads and dart threateningly at the hunter, but as they approach he captures them and fills his bag with them. So the house is rid of snakes. These house snakes, however, are not used for Faruq; that is only made from other snakes that live in the desert.

My tale has been long, like the tail of a snake, and you may think it is a tall tale; but as God is my witness, this is the way it was.73

In the year 1085 (1674–5) snakes had infested the quarters of Ahmed Efendi – he was the imam of our lord Canpoladzade Hüseyn Pasha – and forced him to flee. One day, while the imam’s purebred Arabian horse was eating fodder, a snake bit it on the nose and it died. The carcass swelled to the size of an elephant, and it was impossible to move it. Finally they dug a hole right there and buried it. Anyway, the imam was still unable to go home.



One day I happened to meet one of the snake-hunters and took him to the imam’s quarters. He shouted once at the top of his voice and began to blow on the whistle. Five or ten snakes, each as thick as one’s arm and over a fathom in length, raised their heads and gathered around him. Everyone else fled, including this humble one – I ran to the house of the governor’s secretary and watched from the window. The snakes did battle with the hunter for perhaps an hour. He eventually put eleven of them in his sack and left, uttering the benediction, ‘May God bless you!’ With his house rid of snakes, the imam returned to his quarters and stayed there.





The strangest story of all. A few days later I went to Rumeli Square. It turned out that the snake-hunter had sold the eleven snakes to snake-charmers there for eleven guruş. God knows, each one was as dreadful and frightful as a dragon. But within a few days the snake-charmers had taught them tricks, and they danced like monkeys on Rumeli Square. What strange and marvellous spells and magical charms these snake-hunters have – God knows, they have been vouchsafed the miraculous graces of the saints! The strange thing is that they are terribly funny and entertaining.

While the charmers were making the imam’s snakes dance and perform on Rumeli Square, one of them darted from its place and bit a small boy on the foot. By God’s wisdom, a dervish of the Sa‘diye brotherhood was there. He sucked the venom from the boy’s foot and spat it out on the ground. The boy’s foot was rid of the venom and returned to normal. But the Sa‘di dervish did not stop there. Crying ‘O Living and Eternal One! Peace be upon Noah in the two worlds!’ he seized the snake that had bitten the boy and started to gobble it up.

‘O woe!’ cried the snake-charmer. ‘This was the Pasha’s imam’s snake that I bought for eleven guruş.’

Finally an officer of the agent in charge of public spectacles,74 who had authority over the snake-charmers, came and took the Sa‘di dervish to the Pasha. He continued eating the snake, even in the Pasha’s presence, and was foaming at the mouth.

‘My snake that was as big as a dragon is gone!’ shouted the snake-charmer. He was furious. All present testified that the sheikh (i.e., the Sa‘di dervish) had saved the boy from being poisoned. The Pasha was pleased with the sheikh and had him eat two more snakes in his presence. He bestowed fifty gold pieces on the sheikh, ten on the snake-charmer, and five on the boy who was saved from the poison. Then he dismissed everyone. It was a strange spectacle.

71 This English expression is offered by Redhouse as the equivalent of El ile gelen düğün bayramdır, ‘What is suffered with other people is a wedding party and holiday.’

72 The reference is to Vol. 9, fol. 367b.



73 Note play on words: yılan ‘snake’; yılan hikayeti ‘snake story’ – i.e. a long drawn-out story, a shaggy-dog story; yalan ‘lie’ – a tall tale.

4. Rain, snow and hail in Egypt in 1083 (1672)





In Cairo when it rains, there is a shortage of water. Unlike other places, where rain brings rejoicing and the people bask in the water of mercy, in Cairo the people devour one another from a dearth of water. The reason is that the soil is oily (and so turns to slick mud). If it rains just a little, neither horse nor man nor donkey nor camel – God save them – can go outdoors and fetch water, which is why there is a water shortage. Then the price of one goatskin of water brought on the back of a water-carrier goes up to five para. The water dispensaries open to dispense drinking-water, and water for any other purpose becomes very scarce.

So the governor of the province, or rather the constable, brings 40,000 or 50,000 (!) donkey-driving rubbish sweepers with dry earth which they pour over the public thoroughfares so that people can walk about a bit. Because none of the roads in Cairo is paved, therefore there is so much mud – God save us – it rivals Silistria. Since it is a coastal climate, however, it only rains once or twice a year. If it were like Turkey, then every time it rained, Egypt would be ruined.

In fact, in the year (10)83 (1672–3), there was rain mixed with snow that lasted for seven days and seven nights. People could not go outdoors to visit each other, or go to the public prayer-grounds and offer a prayer for rain (!). Twenty-two houses of Hadari Fellahin were destroyed, and the water shortage was so severe that people still talk about it. When it snowed and the roofs and the people were covered with white snow, the Arabs said, Ash hadha nazala mina’s-sama al-qutni, meaning, ‘What is this? It’s raining down cotton from the sky!’ The Turks said, ‘God be praised, look at God’s mercy!’ and they ate the snow. The Arabs gathered here and there and when they tasted the snow said, Lahha’ad barda’n-nar, meaning, ‘My goodness, cold fire!’ In Cairo the snowfall was light and soon disappeared, but in Buhayra it stayed on the ground for five hours. And that year in Cairo there was a hailstorm in which every hailstone weighed five or six drams.

Fortunately the plants and crops of Egypt have no need of rain, because the Nile overflows and for three months the country turns into a red sea; then the water recedes, crops are planted, and in sixty days they reach maturity, are harvested and stored. That is why there is no need for rain. ‘God’s custom’ operates in this fashion, a marvellous example of divine wisdom.





5. Crocodiles





On the animals that occur in the Nile and their properties


First, there are thousands of fishes in the Nile. But the one they call crocodile is a frightful and harmful beast, similar to the animals known in Turkey as lizard, monitor lizard, and gecko lizard. It has four legs and a tail. In Arabic it is called timsah, in Persian nahang, in Turkish luy, in Mongolian selkun, in the province of Nubia wuli, in the province of Ulwi shunshar. It is an accursed creature, up to fifteen cubits in length. Its back is covered with scales, such that even a musket shot cannot penetrate. Only under the armpit is a soft spot, tender like an earlobe, where it can be shot; or else it can be killed with the shot of a one dram musket striking the head.





Medicinal property. Hunters take its fat, which relieves pain when rubbed on the body in the heat of summer.

In most animals, the lower jaw moves, but in the crocodile the upper jaw opens and shuts while the lower jaw is immobile. There are sixty teeth in the upper jaw and forty in the lower. It also has two long fangs in the lower jaw, while in the upper jaw it has two holes through which the points of its fangs emerge just next to the nostrils. On close inspection I observed that those two fangs are not found in the young of the crocodile, but in adults they emerge like Zahhak’s sword at the ends of the lower jaw.

When a sheep or lamb, or a man, a horse, a cow or a camel, is drinking at the edge of the Nile, the crocodile approaches very stealthily and first strikes with its tail, then drags the animal into the water. If the victim is a man or a sheep, it gives no quarter but swallows the victim in an instant.

By God’s wisdom, it has no hind quarters for the excretion of waste. Instead, when nature calls, it emerges from the Nile onto one of the islands and strolls about. By God’s command, there is a kind of pied bird, like the duck in Turkey, with short legs and a beak and claws. While flying phoenix-like along the river’s edge, it spies the crocodile on the island and approaches it, just as a lynx approaches a lion, and flutters once or twice. The crocodile becomes happy when it sees this bird. It may not even have come out on the island to relieve nature, but simply for a pleasure stroll with its mate. And if the bird is hungry, it will nudge the crocodile on the nose to make it open its mouth. Or the crocodile will open its mouth of its own accord.

The bird then goes into the crocodile’s mouth all the way to its stomach. It kicks and scratches at the filth and takes some into its mouth. The crocodile then opens its mouth like a cave and lets the bird take out all its filth. This makes the crocodile happy, while satisfying the bird’s hunger with the worms it finds amidst the filth. So the bird gets the benefit, and the crocodile gets relief, a marvellous example of divine wisdom.

There is a proverb that ‘The magpie does not groom the calf out of love.’ It picks out lice and worms from the calf’s back in order to get something to eat. This bird performs a similar service for the crocodile.

It sometimes happens that the bird finds nothing good to eat the first time and enters the crocodile’s stomach again to get more filth, but the crocodile, while swallowing, swallows the bird as well. The bird then makes its way back to the crocodile’s mouth and, in its frustration, strikes a few times at a sharp bone that the crocodile has in its upper palate. Because of the pain, the crocodile will then open its mouth like a dragon and let the bird go out.

It is a wonder and a marvel that, while having no hind quarters, every crocodile has a bird appointed to service it. God does what He wills by His power.





A wonder. This crocodile is the dragon of the Nile. All creatures fear it, and it eats any and all. There is no animal in the Nile more swift or more terrible. But on land it is very slow-moving, because its legs and arms are short and it must drag its belly on the ground. So it cannot move fast or go far, and if it is out of water for more than three days it will die.





The crocodile’s mortal enemy. But God has created one creature that is deadly to such a dragon. It is a four-legged furry animal (the ichneumen), quite similar to the one in Turkey known as the weasel which is an enemy of mice. It lives in the Nile and, like the crocodile, also lives on land. It comes out on one of the islands and crawls around the fine sand, seeking crocodiles, for which it nurses undying hostility. It is a small weasel-like creature that also hunts the birds that remove the crocodile’s waste.

As soon as the crocodile comes ashore to relieve itself, this weasel approaches it walking over the sand. It is invisible to the crocodile, whose eyes are at the top of its head and, since it has no neck, cannot look down or left or right. When the aforementioned bird comes to service the crocodile and satisfy its own hunger, the crocodile opens its mouth and the bird goes inside. Then this weasel leaps up and also goes inside the crocodile’s mouth. Now this crocodile, free of guile and full of bile, starts to thrash about and hurls itself into the Nile in a life-or-death struggle.

Once indeed, as I was returning to Cairo from Aswan by boat, a large crocodile caused a surge of waves, swimming right and left like an arrow let loose from a taut bow. I asked our captain, ‘O Hacı Reşid! Why is this crocodile acting like this?’

‘My lord,’ he said, ‘a larger crocodile must be chasing it.’

‘But I don’t see any.’

‘Well, it must be seeking its mate.’

Now the crocodile came very close to our boat, and I told my slaveboys to shoot it. They let loose one or two bullets, but to no effect. Finally it came out onto the western shore, struggling and flaying about, climbed up the slope and stayed there. We followed it onto the shore and, as we were observing, a weasel came out of its mouth and ran into the Nile. The crocodile died then and there. It was 30 feet long.

There are crocodiles that reach a length of 40 or 50 feet. Indeed, there is no region of the Nile with more gigantic crocodiles than these provinces of Isna and Aswan. In Hafir-i Kabir – that is the fortress of Kör Hüseyn Bey, who acts as vizier to the king of Funjistan – the fortress gate is not made of iron but rather is the skin of a huge crocodile, nailed to the wall with nails weighing three okkas apiece. It is just the torso, minus the head and tail. I made a point of measuring it with a cubit-measure: it came to fourteen cubits high and seven cubits wide. I was amazed. Some of the Funj elders told me that they had seen even larger ones.

{The crocodile actually has another enemy, which is the hippopotamus. In Nubia, and also near the city of Dongola in the province of Barbaristan, crocodiles are few because there are so many hippopotami. But in Nubia the crocodile is called wuli, in the province of Ulwi it is called shushar.}





A wonder. The crocodile, when it wishes to have sex, emerges onto one of the islands with its mate, and the male lays the female on her back. Some Arab tribesmen, in order to rid themselves of gonorrhoea, or else prompted by lust, hide in the sand and scrub and, while the female is lying on her back and before the male has done the deed, rushes out of his ambush with a shout. The male runs off into the Nile, but the female is left paralysed, like a tortoise, unable to move. This is because her forelegs are short, her locomotion in the water being through her tail and mouth; and unless the male, after sex, turns her right side up, she is stuck there with her vagina sticking out beneath her hind legs. So the lustful pervert covers her hind legs with sand and piles sand over her tail as well, then fearlessly performs the ugly deed – God be our refuge!

But the rakish devil swears that the pleasure derived from a crocodile is greater than that from a virgin maid, indeed that the female crocodile is exceedingly hot and that each time she has sex she is a virgin and gushes with blood. Also, the pudendum of a man who has sex with a crocodile exudes a musk-like perfume for an entire week. As for the crocodile’s vagina, it is reportedly white and ‘Chinese’ like that of an Ethiopian slavegirl. And that is a fact, as I can testify, since they once brought a female crocodile to Özbek Bey, the governor of Girga, and it had a rounded vagina exactly as I have described.

As for this crocodile (i.e., the 30-foot one observed near Aswan?), its back was as pied and mottled as a chameleon’s.

{Another marvellous creature of the Nile is the Old Man of the Sea, called (? — lacuna in text), the upper part (?) man and the lower part fish (? — lacuna in text).}





A marvellous story concerning the Nile crocodile. Indeed, while I was travelling in the region of Shallal (the First Cataract) the conversation turned to crocodiles. Our host was a certain Abu Jaddullah, a venerable sheikh, one who had experienced the vicissitudes of fortune, one who belonged to the class of lovers (i.e., those mystically inclined), an upright individual. He related as follows, ‘When I was young I had a crocodile in the Nile. It was a female. At that time I was making a living by fishing with nets. Sometimes I netted a big fish and set it aside. One day this crocodile swam by. It was a very beautiful specimen. I snipped off some fish heads and threw them to her. She ate them and went on. This continued for several days: I gave her fish like this every day. One day she just strode out of the water, raised her tail and lay on her back. I recalled that our Arabs have sex with crocodiles. So I too girded my loins and went to it. The pleasure drove me out of my mind. Afterward I took a club and propped it between the sand and the crocodile’s back, then stood to one side. She wriggled onto her feet, gave me a glance, then went back into the river and cavorted like mad.

‘I cohabited with her for three years. All my clansmen in Shallal knew about it. If one day I failed to show up she would look for me. Eventually I stopped going to the edge of the Nile out of fear of the other crocodiles. Whenever my crocodile came to the shore she left a kind of fragrant oil like civet. I used to fill jars with it and sell them for ten guruş a piece. I earned my living that way for three years.

‘Then one day I happened to go over to one of the islands in the Nile, and my crocodile followed me onto the shore. She walked around a bit, then rolled over and expired. Suddenly it grew dark, and when the darkness lifted what should I see: the crocodile’s head and torso had transformed into that of a beautiful girl. But her legs and her vulva were still those of a crocodile. It turned out that she was the daughter of the sheikh of the Kunuz Arabs and had been bewitched. By God’s command, at the moment she died the spell became ineffective and she resumed her original form. The people of that island and I buried her.’

This was the story the sheikh related, and some local residents who were present approved it and bore witness that it was true. For in that country, having sex with crocodiles, and killing crocodiles and nailing their skins to the gates, are nothing to be ashamed of but are rather considered heroic deeds. And anyone who does not do battle with a crocodile is not considered a man. There is a distinct rivalry among them, and they only give their daughters in marriage to one who has killed a crocodile or has killed an elephant. For in that country, the crocodile is a dragon, very harmful and accursed, since it snatches men and animals as they are drinking and children as they are swimming near the shore.

The basic reason why men of this region have sex with crocodiles is that they suffer from incontinence and gonorrhoea, and they engage in intercourse with crocodiles in order to rid themselves of these afflictions. Some, who will not commit that act, have sex instead with Ethiopian slavegirls who, being very hot and attractive, drain men of sperm and other things.





{The Nilometre talisman for crocodiles. There are several stories among the people giving the reason why the nilometre is called Umm al-qiyas (‘Mother of Measure’). In one version, a sultan had a beautiful daughter named Miqyas (‘Measure’). One day, while she was swimming near the shore of the Nile, a crocodile snatched her and took her away. When the Sultan heard of this, he moaned and groaned. One of the great saints, Sheikh Abu Bakr al-Batrini, who happened to be present, uttered a prayer of supplication that the girl be saved. By God’s command, the crocodile left her where it had found her, safe and sound. The sultan, in his joy, built a pavilion on that spot and named it Umm al-qiyas after his daughter. Later Sheikh Batrini had a marble figure of a crocodile made and buried it under the Nilometre pool. It is a Greatest Talisman. From that day to this, if a crocodile passes below the Nilometre, it immediately flips over and withdraws to the shore, where it is killed. That is why there are no crocodiles below Cairo.}





Peculiarity of the crocodile. After the crocodile and its mate have sex on the shore, the female lays eggs, the size of ostrich eggs, only they are not round but oval and mottled. She buries them in the sand and returns to the water, but every day she comes out to check them. It sometimes happens that an egg is exposed to the heat and the white of the egg gets cooked. In that case, on the fortieth day a skink emerges, having formed from the yellow of the egg. But those eggs that remain in the sand (protected from the heat) become crocodiles, by God’s command.

The crocodile has a membrane on its brain that makes it suitable for living in the Nile; but the skink does not develop that membrane and so remains on land. The female crocodile lays ten or twelve eggs, of which some become crocodiles and some skinks. The skink does go into the water, but must come out again; it cannot make its home in the Nile. The physicians call it the water skink. Its progeny however, which they call the land skink, never goes into the Nile and never drinks water, but is bound to the sand and the desert. The physicians have noted its extremely beneficial medicinal qualities.





6. The Cairo underworld and unusual trades





On the vices of Egypt and the police guilds


The accursed and irreligious tribe is this group.





Guild of prostitutes of Babulluq. 800 harlots of the class of rebellious ladies. Their huts are amongst the rubbish-heaps and at the foot of the Babulluq Gate.





Guild of home-bound prostitutes. These are the she-devils of the covered and honourable women. They ply their trade in their homes, but they have pimps. They are 2,000 in number who are listed in the police chief’s register and pay a tax. And there is an incalculable number under the control of the military groups, whom the police chief cannot touch.





Babulluq boys. In the coffee houses, boza shops and taverns, and in Rumeli Square, are to be found all the catamites. They too pay a tax.





Sheikh of the Arasat. Three men, one in Bulaq, one in Old Cairo (Fustat), one in New Cairo. All the male and female prostitutes are noted in their registers, and they exact taxes from them.





Sergeants of Babulluq. Forty individuals. They know each prostitute’s house and whether a women slept at home or not.





Guild of pimps of Babulluq. They go from house to house in the whorehouse district with akçe counting-boards in hand and wheel and deal as though trading in horses and mules.





Guild of female panders. These are old hags who get a wage from would-be fornicators for finding the finest of fornicatresses. 300 ancient crones.





Guild of bazaar jobbers. They bring items from the boza shops and taverns and kebab-houses and other places of entertainment in Babulluq and sell them to make a living. Sometimes a silly and inexperienced youth gets leave from his master to go to the bath house and instead comes to Babulluq where he makes out with a sweetheart in one of the huts. At some point he wants wine and kebab, so he gives three akçe to the bazaar jobber who obtains whatever the youth desires. But into the wine or the boza, the bazaar jobber puts white clove or datura or earwax or rush ashes, and when that youth drinks a cup, he topples over like a sack of henna. At once he is relieved of his clothes and his knife or dagger and his purse. Some low-life gallows-birds use him as they wish, then dump him in a corner or a remote spot. When the refined youth recovers he sees that he is naked, but what can he do? He cannot even tell anyone what happened. And whatever is lost is gone. If he has a lot of money on him, they kill him right away and bury him.

God knows that many such incidents occurred during the governorship of Canpoladzade Hüseyn Pasha. When he was told about them, he realised that they constituted a loss of revenue, and that he would be liable, so he ordered his chief doorkeeper to tear down the houses of prostitution. That agha assembled a few thousand Barbaris and fellahin who tore down all the whorehouses and boza shops and taverns and banished all the prostitutes from the city. So Cairo was cleansed.

My aim in recording these scurrilous matters is to warn the heedless. There are sections of Cairo that one should avoid. Those who know the city are aware that there are dangers lurking in every corner.





Sheikh of the beggars. One man. Their convent is in Rumeli Square. All the beggars forgather there. They have twelve sergeants who attend at the Pasha’s and the chief kadi’s gates. Whatever direction the Pasha goes, he informs the beggars and they stand there in rows along the highway.

All the beggars of Cairo, numbering 9,000, are listed in the sheikh’s register. They offer prayers for the Pasha and the notables, to the degree of the alms received from them. But if a beggar curses anyone, the sheikh is informed and punishes him.

On the day that the noble Ka‘ba cover leaves the city, the sheikh of the beggars is mounted on a donkey, with his örf-i izafet (a type of large ceremonial turban) on his head, accompanied by his one-eyed and one-armed and scald-headed servants carrying bastinados, and thousands of beggars pass in procession. This custom is only found in Cairo.





Guild of oil-lamp lighters. Forty shops, 200 individuals. On nights of saint’s birthdays (mevlud) and nights when the town is decked out, also in the months of Rajab, Sha‘ban and Ramadan, when the shops are open every night until the dawn prayer, these people provide illumination with oil-lamps. They are sure to light one in front of every great merchant’s shop that is not open. However many thousands of oil-lamps you may wish to be lit, they will haggle with you and then provide illumination for houses and highways. This also is a custom peculiar to Cairo.





Guild of slave merchants. 2,000 individuals, in the hans of Cairo. They go once a year to the provinces of Funjistan, Afnu, Qirmanqa and Baghanisqa and bring back black slaves. They themselves are dark-skinned men from the provinces of the Oases, Aswan and Ibrim.





Guild of eunuch surgeons. Ten individuals, in their homes. Their trade – God preserve us! – is to make eunuchs out of black-skinned young boys from May Burnu and Jaju, Qirmanqa and Baghanisqa, Ethiopia and Funj and Afnu. They feed the boys and give them saffron sherbet, then line up 100 or 200 in a row and cut off their penis and testicles with a razor. They stick a reed where the penis was and sprinkle a kind of dust made from vegetation in order to staunch the bleeding. Over that they put dust made from acacia leaves, then pieces of oiled black leather, and wrap everything in rags. In this way they cut off these boys’ progeny. They are ruthless Sudanese merchants, ten in number, hideous black-skinned men of ill-omen, with dark faces and lustreless eyes.

Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha once had 100 or 200 little black Arab boys eunuched to give them as gifts. I went on purpose to watch the operation. God preserve us! Some of the boys in their anguish thrashed about like chickens with their heads cut off and had to be tied down; some were so weakened, they took to their beds; some died within a few days.

Such are these merciless executioners and ruthless Sudanese merchants. This too is something peculiar to Cairo.





Guild of carpet makers. Twenty workshops, 300 individuals. They weave silk carpets and prayer-rugs, in praise of which the tongue falls short. True, carpets are also woven in (the Anatolian towns of) Uşak, Kula and Alaşehir. But nowhere will you find the quality of these Egyptian carpets, except perhaps in Isfahan.





Guild of donkey drivers. As many as 3,000 individuals; because Cairo’s ferryboat and caique are the donkey. They amble so nimbly, even an ambling horse cannot keep up with them. It is said that there are 40,000 donkeys in Cairo. All the notables ride them, with no stigma attached. It is, after all, a Sunna of the Prophet, since the noble Prophet had a donkey named Yağfur and always used to ride it. I have even heard it quoted as a Hadith, that anyone who makes fun of someone riding a donkey is an infidel.





Guild of donkey shearers. They have no shop, but there are certain places where they are usually to be found. Once a month they shear all of Cairo’s donkeys and camels. 200 individuals. They shear so closely that not a sign of fur is left, as though they used a razor instead of shears.





Guild of pickpockets. They are under the authority of the chief of police. They will steal a man’s purse, or his knife or dagger, out of his pocket or out of his bosom, without hesitation or regret. 300 individuals. One must be very wary of these people in crowded places. They are such masters of their trade, they will steal an eye and leave the eye-salve in its place. They have a sheikh of their own. If the chief of police wants to, he can find the stolen item that very hour; because all the thieves and pickpockets are in his register.

Guild of cot makers. They make sugar cages (!?) and cots out of datepalm wood. (—) individuals. This trade is also not found elsewhere.





Guild of rubbish sweepers. (—) individuals. They sweep up the rubbish in all the highways and bring it to the stokeholes of baths, glass works, bakeries, gypsum works, lime kilns, and pottery kilns to be burnt.

There is no group of people in Cairo more misshapen and fantastical than these. They are like creatures that have been metamorphosed. Nevertheless – in accordance with the verse,

Ecstatics know what ecstasy is.



What need is there to talk about it?





– I have seen some pious men in Cairo who, when they catch sight of these detestable individuals, do not pass them by without kissing their hands. Many people believe that in Egypt, the saints of God are to be found among these rubbish sweepers, eccentric dervishes, junk dealers and street barbers. No one has knowledge of what is hidden except God (27:65). And note the Hadith Qudsi (Hadith in which the speaker is God): My saints are under my collar; no one knows them but I.





Guild of camel meat and camel liver cooks. Ten shops and individuals, on Rumeli Square. It is food for the poverty-stricken, but very tasty; I have eaten it often.





Guild of earth rat hunters. They have no shop but operate out of huts and tents in Rumeli Square. Twenty individuals. The season for these rats is the breaching of the Nile (flooding of the Nile canal). At that time these hunters catch them and bring them to Rumeli Square to be sold.

They are a small animal, more like a rabbit than a rat, and emerge out of the soil, by God’s command; they are half soil and half dust. I have seen them bleeding on the ground when a farmer driving his team turned over their den with his ploughshare. So eating them is permitted according to the four Sunni rites.

When these rats mature they make mounds like moles. When the hunters see that, they know that there are mature earth-rats and dig them out. They are a small, nicely-formed animal with fur like a squirrel. A live one weighs 50 or 60 drams. They are very plump, and their flesh is light, invigorating and easy to digest. I often ate them when I was going to the Oases. Their diet is completely vegetarian, consisting of underground roots and grasses.





Guild of sherbet makers from henbane. Two shops in Rumeli Square. They soak the henbane overnight, then strain the liquid, add a bit of purified honey, and sell it by the bowlful. The dervishes who drink it are stunned when they look into the faces of their beloveds and can recite 1,001 verses of poetry while standing on one leg. It is said to be a narcotic.





Guild of subya makers. It is boza made from rice, as described above. Peculiar to Egypt.





Guild of sherbet makers from licorice. It is described above. Peculiar to Egypt.





Guild of sherbet makers from tamarind. Has a laxative effect. Also peculiar to Egypt.





Guild of akve makers. Arab daggers as large as swords. Not found in Turkey.





Guild of rush mat makers. They make fine patterned rush mats that sell for 40 or 50 guruş apiece.





Guild of cooks. They make the Egyptian specialties, which are cous-cous pilav, Jews’ mallow, okra, taro and cauliflower.





Guild of miray halva. No shop, forty individuals. They put a mirror on the end of a mottled stick. When the sugar has reached the proper consistency and been made into halva, they stick it underneath the mirror (? – text confused) and draw out the halva. They go from shop to shop reciting poems and at each couplet give out some halva, for which they receive one para. They utter a benediction and go on to the next. It is a type of dervish-style halva.





Guild of Bahari dervishes. For the most part they are Yemenite dervishes. They put various flowers – sweet basil, hyacinth, rose, jasmine – inside a bath towel and to any of the notables whom they meet on the main roads they give a syringa or anemone and get something in return. Seventy or eighty individuals. These too are peculiar to Egypt.





7. Trades and products lacking in Egypt





Trades and products lacking in Egypt


It is well-known among the cognoscenti, and it has become proverbial, that in Egypt there are many horses but no master farriers – there are only makers of shoes for donkeys; there are many sick people but no physicians (hekim) or magistrates (hakim); many blind people but no eye-doctors.

There is a great deal of truth to this. One man out of two, by God’s command, is blind or rheumy-eyed. If someone has trouble seeing, they say – and this too has become a proverb – ‘Your eyes are like those of the son of an Egyptian janissary;’ and that is because a child born to a Turk in Egypt is bound to have watery eyes and poor vision.

When they say there are no magistrates, what they mean is that no magistrate – whether religious or secular – carries out his duties, but everything is ‘under protection’75 and the governor is only a tax farmer trying to maximise his income.

There are no water mills or springs, but there are many wells.

There are no public weighing machines specifically for flour or oil or honey. To be sure, there are scales for silks; and customs dues are exacted on candles, household slaves, gold and silver thread, captive slaves, and merchandise in the bedestans. But none of these has a specific place or office for collecting the tax. Regarding bedestans, there is really no room for them; only the Khan-i Khalil might be considered one.

There are no shops selling flour or sheep’s-heads. No makers of mariner’s compasses or bowstrings. No one selling mustard or salad or grape syrup. No one manufacturing mail armour, shields, shagreen, gun barrels or triggers. Mail armour comes from Dagestan and Circassia, shields from Aleppo, shagreen from all over, gun barrels from Algeria.

There is no one making shoe nails, scales for iron, scales for rice, augers, adzes, or saws. No one making thimbles, needles, wire thread, or arrowheads. No one making trumpets, shawms, cylindrical drums, reed flutes, panpipes, or small kettledrums – but they do make marvellous large kettledrums for the district governors. No one making glass bowls or casting bronze plates; no knife-grinders; no diamond cutters; not even anyone drawing wire from iron – wire is imported ready-made from Europe. No one making tin buttons, lead whetstones for barbers, or lead slabs. Concerning the latter, however, a certain mature individual named Hacı Nasır, at my instruction, produced the workbench and mold, and cast around 1,000 lead slabs; they were worked into water containers and sent to the Haseki Sultan imaret and hospital in Mecca.

There are no shops for thumbstalls, toothpicks, drill masters, glue, cudgels, turban crests, deerskin, muslin caps, janissary felt caps, or whips. But all these items are imported to Cairo and can be found in the marketplace at a cheap price.

There is no one making Kashan tiles; no one extracting silver with aqua-fortis; 76 no one making barrels, lime mortar, or putty; no one cleaning water conduits, laying roof tiles, or repairing pavements. None of these trades is found here, nor indeed does Cairo have any need for them. As for precious fabrics, they are imported from India and Yemen, and are plentiful.

75Cümle şey himayededir – probably a reference to mal-i himaye ‘protection taxes’ – see Shaw 1962, 138; Shaw 1966, 157–8.



76 See Vol. 1, fol. 187a for the process referred to.





8. Chicken incubation; Sabil Allam stones





Another marvel is that they bury 10,000 eggs in horse manure and in twenty days 10,000 chicks going cheep-cheep begin to walk about. It is an amazing sight. But not everyone can do this. In the kadi-district of Abyar, in a village called Barma which belongs to Serdar Süleyman, one of the Egyptian beys, there is a noble lineage. Incubating chickens in manure belongs to that family. Anyone who wishes to raise chickens in this fashion must get a man from this lineage. He will go to whatever kadi-district you want to take him.

First he builds a special oven for incubating chickens. It is a large oven, like a bread oven, with a dome on top and empty below. He divides the inside with brick into compartments. In each compartment he lays down manure, two fingers thick – the manure is unburnt and soft, fluffed like wool – and fifty eggs. But he checks each egg, holding it up to the sun: if it is fresh, he puts it in; if it is addled, he doesn’t. An addled egg will split from the heat of the manure and infect the other eggs, so the chicks won’t come out. Therefore he only uses fresh eggs. One can also tell by looking at the egg whether the chick that emerges will be a rooster or a hen.

Over the eggs he puts another layer of manure, two fingers thick. Once the oven is filled up, he lights the fire underneath, again using manure as the fuel rather than wood. The fire is kept going for three days. On the fourth day, the chicken-father strips and goes inside the oven, clucking like a hen, and turns over all the eggs. For this operation he uses a special glove made of chicken feathers. He turns over each of the fifty eggs in each compartment, one by one, and puts a few feathers in between them. Then he fumigates the oven with a kind of incense, closes the mouth and leaves.

The master incubator never shows this operation to anyone. But this humble one went to that village for the express purpose of seeing it with my own eyes. During the twenty days I stayed there, the chicken-mother (!) entered the oven and turned over the eggs three times.

Before twenty days are up, the chicks start to hatch like an army of jinn and they begin to scratch at the manure. They are immediately removed from the oven, so as not to harm the eggs that have not yet cooked and are still covered with manure. Outside the oven are some broody hens, and the chicks going cheep-cheep begin to march behind them.

One drawback is that the chickens incubated in horse manure do not have the same flavour as those hatched beneath a hen, and the meat is a bit tough. Also the kite, otherwise Pharaoh’s falcon, is very hostile to these chicks. There are little boys who keep guard over them; otherwise in one day they would all be snatched away by kites. There is no bird in Egypt more harmful than the kite.

Ten days after hatching, these chicks are stuffed into bushel baskets.77 They give five or ten bushels each to the peasants (i.e., to sell in the cities?). Praise be to God that I have seen chickens bought and sold by the bushel in Egypt.

These chickens sold by the bushel are, for the most part, a government monopoly. There is a special officer, charged by the Pasha’s chief panter, who has thousands of chickens produced in this way. 500 chickens are slaughtered for the Pasha’s kitchen every day and given to his retinue as part of their ration.

Unless you have seen how these chickens are produced, you can have no idea what devils these Egyptian fellahin are. Indeed, it is a marvel and a mystery, hard for the mind to conceive. But God creates what He pleases by His power and decides what He wills by His might (24:45).





A noteworthy work of God (i.e. natural phenomenon). In the place called Sabil Allam, described above, are some small stones of various colours. The Sabil Allam stones are famous in Egypt. They are of various colours and shinier than diamonds or rubies. They are found in that plain and sell for 100 or 500 guruş. And there are numerous stones of the cat’seye and fish’s-eye variety that sell for five or ten guruş. Sometimes a windstorm blows away the sand and reveals countless such stones. Cheap to begin with, they sell at a great price after an engraver polishes them and carves them into various shapes. Some of them are more lustrous than Badakhshan rubies and more radiant than diamonds.

The Egyptian chroniclers and ulema agree that it was in Sabil Allam that Shaddad ibn Ad built the many-columned city of Iram (89:7). Indeed, the foundations of great buildings are evident here and there in this valley of Sabil Allam. Also, when Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha was removed from office he stayed for seventy-seven days in this plain of Sabil Allam, during which time his servants, at loose ends, gathered these Sabil Allam stones and used them to play board games. Later they gave some to an engraver who used them as ring stones, so all the servants came into possession of a seal ring. One finds stones of that value – it is a wonderful phenomenon.

Another stone found in the Sabil Allam plain, hard and bright yellow, is the object of Frankish physicians who come and look for it in the heat of summer. Its medicinal property is that if a man holds it in both hands, he immediately becomes nauseous and starts vomiting, and the nausea does not let up until he lets go of the stone. It effectively purges the stomach of all yellow and black bile.

Finally, there is a pied stone like a bead. A woman who binds it to her waist during intercourse will definitely not conceive. In fact, this stone is very common among the prostitutes of Babulluq in Cairo. When my mother gave birth to this humble one, my head passed through her womb only with great difficulty, and as a result her vagina was disfigured. To avoid getting pregnant thereafter she always used to carry some of these Sabil Allam stones, and would bind them to her waist whenever she had intercourse with my father.

77 Instead of simply kile ‘bushel’, Evliya uses the phrase dipsiz kile ‘bottomless bushel’, an idiom for a spendthrift.





9. Exploring a pyramid





One hour from the town of Giza on the west bank of the Nile are the three ‘mountains’ known as the pyramids. They are the tallest and most ancient buildings on the face of the earth. They are huge man-made mountains, each one a veritable Mt Qaf, and each one pertaining to an idol. Thus they call the large pyramid Mt Balbahith (Belhib), the middle one Mt Malhawiya (Belhube), and the lowest one Mt Abu’l-hawl (the Sphinx).

There are thousands of stories about these artificial mountains. Some chroniclers say they were built before the Flood by Ad ibn Shaddad. Others maintain that before the Flood, King Surid, at the urging of his soothsayers, built them as a tomb for himself. When they were finished he filled the three pyramids with treasure, put in weapons, and also placed therein the books of all the sciences written by the prophet Idris. He set up talismans and guardians (?) and covered the pyramids with brocade, making them a hidden treasure. He also built a great city on the shore of the Nile where the guards of the pyramids resided. Every year, in spring, all the people of the world came and circumambulated the pyramids, as they do the Ka‘ba. (Marginal notes with additional information)

Even now, in the northern pyramid, there is a south-facing gate, inside of which, on the right side, is a Hebrew inscription carved on the rocks. It reads, ‘I who built the pyramids completed them in six years. May those who come after me be able to tear them down from their foundation in 600 years. Indeed, it is easier to tear down than to build up. And I covered them with brocade. May the kings who come after me be able to cover them with reed mats.’

In fact, the Caliph Ma’mun (Abbasid caliph, reg. 813-33) came from Baghdad to Cairo and girt his loins to conquer Pharaoh’s treasure buried in the pyramids. He made great efforts, piling wood and lighting fires, pouring vinegar, hurling large stones with mangonels. In seven months he was able to tear down an area of 20 cubits. He found a large chrysolite jar encrusted with gems and containing 1,000 gold pieces weighing one okka apiece. On a rock the following was inscribed, ‘O you who wish to conquer this tomb for its treasure! However much effort and expense you put into it, so much will you take out. If you covet too much, you will depart this perishing world.’

When Ma’mun and his soldiers saw this, they were amazed. Those 1,000 gold pieces exactly corresponded to the troubles they had undergone and the expenses they had incurred over the past seven months.

They also realised that the phrase on the rock inside the gate on the northern side – ‘May the kings who come after me cover them with reed mats’ – was pregnant with meaning. So Ma’mun ordered that the pyramids be covered with Egyptian reed mats. When they were half covered, a strong wind arose and swept the mats and the workers up into the air like a falconer’s lure, breaking the mats asunder and rendering the workers lifeless.

Finally, heeding the advice of Caliph Ma’mun’s vizier Husayn ibn Sahl, they gave up and returned to Baghdad. The places on the pyramids that were destroyed during the reign of Caliph Ma’mun are still visible.

When Yusuf Salah al-Din (Saladin, Ayyubid sultan, reg. 1169–93) was renovating the fortifications of Cairo, he removed stones from the pyramids and used them for the citadel and the lower castle. Sultan Mu’ayyad (Mu’ayyad Shaykh, Mamluk sultan, reg. 1412–21) also used stones from the pyramids to construct the eleven dikes nearby. Those places too (where stones were removed) are still visible.

As for the saying of Surid – ‘I built the pyramids in six years. May the kings who come after me be able to tear them down in 600 years’ – the interpretation of this humble one is: If I were to mine the pyramids with 100 quintals of black powder and one ‘six-treasure’ mine that was used in the siege of Candia castle, the mountains of Ahram (the pyramids) would be blown sky-high like an ihram (pilgrim’s garment) and no trace would be left of the building, not even the foundation, but all would crumble to the ground and melt into the Nile.

But, to tell the truth, I have never seen such a huge building on the face of the earth. God be praised that, during the governorship of Ibrahim Pasha, I spent five or ten days partying next to the pyramids, while our horses were grazing in the nearby meadow, and I had occasion to tour them several times and marvel at them.

On one occasion there were forty-five of us, including some in the retinue of the Master of the Horse and Behlul Agha and other officers. We brought torches, oilcloth lanterns and wind-tapers. After clearing away the sand and rubbish from the door on the northern side of the large pyramid, we took refuge in God and entered with a besmele. This humble one kept an eye on the compass and the watch.

The first 700 paces in a southern direction was a broad highway, fifteen cubits wide and surmounted by vaults 20 cubits high. There were numerous caves on either side, also man-made halls with domes carved from the soft rock stratum and gilded and decorated as though just emerged from the hand of Bihzad. Every cell was full of human bones, and every skull could hold 100 bushels of wheat. Only God knows how many skulls there were, both large and small. In our path lay a shinbone, still covered with its skin, that was 71 spans as measured by this humble one’s hand. There were an abundance of such bones.

One large cave was full of human corpses that lay shrouded in date-palm fibres. And there were several hundred skeletons (or mummies), each 70 or 80 paces tall. But we nearly suffocated from the smell of bat droppings, the bats being as large as crows and hanging from the rocks by their claws. Some hurled themselves at the lanterns and torches and scorched their wings. Some struck us in the face.

At this juncture, a few of our companions got frightened and went back with one or two lanterns. The thirty-five of us who were left summoned our courage and went on for another hour, along a gently descending slope, our compass pointing south. We saw vaulted halls like the Vault of Chosroes, each containing mummified human corpses, and near them, trampled in the dust, rotted reed mats and pieces of cloth woven of date-palm fibre.

Fifty paces further on, continuing on a downward slope, we came upon a large pool of clear water. But all around the edge sat frightful birds, as large as eagles or geese. As soon as they saw us, they flapped their wings and produced a thunderous noise that made our brains ooze from our ears. And the bats besmirched us and our clothes with their droppings. Meanwhile the torchbearers informed us they were running out of kindling. The noise produced by those eagles’ wings was particularly dreadful.

We had no heart to advance a single step beyond that pool, and had just decided to turn around, when a freezing-cold wind from the direction of the birds made us shudder with apprehension. What would we do if our torches and lanterns went out? The bats meanwhile, that were the size of pigeons, kept fluttering at the flames like moths and brushing against our faces with their wings. It nearly drove us crazy.

To make a long story short, guided by the piles of stones we had set up along the way, we somehow managed to make our way back and emerged safe and sound. Our companions who had fled earlier teased us, saying, ‘Where did you get these filthy faces and strange looks?’ God knows, though we emerged safely, we were completely exhausted. But it was a tremendous experience! Only God knows what lies beyond that pool.

Thus this humble one saw the inside of one of the pyramids. There was no buried treasure, only buried men. But there is no doubt that it is under a talismanic power. For when we came to that pool, all of us were confounded, and we remained in this stunned condition until we came out into the air, when we recovered our souls. God save us! May I never be vouchsafed to enter it again.

After returning to our tents for breakfast and coffee, we surveyed the pyramids from all sides. Two of them have a square base with each side 200 paces long, making the circumference 800 paces. Each of the stones is 20 or 30 cubits long and broad. And the height from the ground to the top is 200 cubits. The large pyramid has a door on the northern side through which we entered, but the other two have no visible entrance. The Abu’l-hawl pyramid (the Sphinx) is quite small, but both are mountains with square base and pointed tip reaching to the sky.

I climbed up the pyramid that we had entered. At the top there is a square or arena large enough to pitch a pup-tent with ten flaps. In some of the crevices I found jesses and hoods and pigeon rings and anklets. All Cairo was spread out beneath my feet – so lofty are these mountains. There are also structures built of black stone and guarded by talismans all around the pyramids. I would need an entire volume to describe them all.





10. Weddings, circumcision, etc.





Wedding ceremony of the Egyptian fellahin


Mentioned here is the rule of the Hadari fellahin as passed down from their ancestors.

When they want to marry an Arab girl to a Muslim man, the religious ceremony takes place according to the rule, then on the night of the wedding procession 1,000 or 2,000 relatives and associates and hangers-on assemble in a broad plain. They eat Jews’ mallow, okra, taro and cheeses.

When this feast is over, and after the evening prayer, a lovely young janissary appears from one side of this plain. With shawl and turban and a motley waistband, a silver-handled knife in one hand and a club in the other, shouting raucously and striking anyone in his path, he makes his way through the crowd, chases away some people and breaks some objects, thrashes with his knife and walks and talks like a drunkard. As this sweetheart approaches, some men get up and stop him, kiss his face and seat him in a corner.

Now it turns out that this bandit boy is actually the bride! She stands up again and cries, ‘Where is our master?’ She is supposed to find her husband and try to kill him. Some men plead for him. She says, ‘I don’t care, my dear.’ She greets those present with hugs and kisses, girds up the skirts of her dolman, puts down the two knives and departs.

As soon as the bride is gone, they find the groom and bring him. He settles in a corner, dressed in finery. Some of his friends go and tell him, ‘Thank God, your beloved came and was very angry but she couldn’t find you. There must be some mistake.’ He gets up and says, ‘Fie! My beloved apparently wants to kill me. What is my crime? I’ve spent ten purses for her sake, etc. etc.’ – and item by item, like a talking ledger, he recounts all his expenses for the past month or two. The audience actually takes great pride, boasting that so-and-so’s daughter got married and got so much money.

Now the groom gets angry and starts brandishing his knife, saying ‘I spent so much money’ and ‘If I find my beloved I’ll kill her.’ As he is stalking about, the bride reappears on one side of the plain and the groom runs away and hides in a corner.

This time the bride is out-fitted as a lovely scholar from a good family, with a red mohair cloak over her shoulders, a scarf round her throat and an ulema’s turban on her head. As she approaches, some relatives go to greet her and some scholarly types stand up and invite her to sit with them.

‘No,’ she says, ‘I have a legal dispute with so-and-so’ – meaning her husband. ‘He apparently wants to kill me. My parents married me to him and gave so many purses and jewels and gold and silver vessels as a dowry.’ She too lists her dowry items one by one, so everyone knows that the virgin so-and-so was married with so much wealth and so many purses. If the girl is not a good speaker she gets prompted by some relatives nearby.

Then the girl takes out her knife again and pretends to be searching for the groom. He takes flight. When the bride has left, the groom comes back in another outfit and once again repeats the precise amount he has paid, how much went to the bride’s mother, how much to her father, her mother’s sister and her father’s sister, and lists all the presents he has given.

Then it is the bride’s turn again. This time she is dressed as a cavalryman, with red trousers and a dagger in her belt. She searches for the groom, brandishing the dagger, and again lists all the valuable items in her dowry. The next time she comes dressed as a sheikh and imparts all sorts of sheikhly counsel. When it is the groom’s turn he shows up as a dervish, with a staff in one hand and prayer-beads in the other, shaking his head and reciting litanies.

In short, during that long night until the glimmer of dawn, bride and groom appear ten times each in various costumes and have all sorts of disputes. And the bride sits on the knee of any man she likes and they talk and kiss.

Meanwhile the plain is adorned with hundreds of torches and thousands of oil-lamps; kettledrums and five-layered military bands are played; poems are recited in loud voices, both in classical Arabic and in colloquial; and everyone has a wonderful time.

A torch procession comes in from one side, with numerous people on foot accompanying the bride who is mounted on a horse with bejewelled saddle. She is smothered in sable furs and wearing all her gold and finery, a Pharaonic crown with three forked crests on her head, and her face still unveiled. She greets the crowd on either side. All the fellahin rise to their feet and return the greeting. Hundreds of boys and girls holding candles and crying ‘God save the Sultan!’ accompany the bride to the middle of the plain. She rubs her handkerchief on the crown and waves it over the crowd. All the fellahin click their heels.





Description of the Pharaonic crown. It is a wadded turban of camel’s leather, the size of a frying-pan, with eight corners. Every corner is woven with gold thread, and there is evidence that the spaces between the corners were originally studded with pearls. The inside is cotton lined with velvet and embroidery. At the very top is a garnet the size of an apple. The edges are adorned with turquoises and carnelians, and the edging is crenellated. It is a strange and wonderful crown.

Now the bride dismounts and looks for the groom, saying: ‘Where is he who will marry me, this humble one with the noble heart?’

The groom emerges from his tent with a swagger, but the bride grabs him by the beard and holds up her unsheathed dagger as though she is about to cut his throat. Some peacemakers intervene and reconcile the bride to the proceeding by making the groom promise to give her a house or an orchard or a few slavegirls or a few purses – in short, whatever he can afford. All present serve as witnesses and recite a Fatiha.

The groom immediately snatches the bride from amidst the crowd and takes her into a nuptial chamber or a tent or into a corner, where he lays her down, Pharaonic crown and all, and removes her maidenhead. The girl emerges, bleeding and panting as though escaped from a cudgel. She shows her blood to her father and mother and everyone else, and utters some plaintive words. They again boast to one another, saying ‘Our daughter proved a virgin.’ For among these Arabs, and particularly this tribe of Hadari fellahin, finding a virgin is not easy.

Then the girl is consoled by her parents and relatives. They finally remove the Pharaonic crown. As she sighs and groans, the father and mother wipe off the blood and toss the bloody rags over the congregation. Summoning the groom, they ask him why he has bloodied their daughter in this fashion. He denies it, but she says, ‘Look at his clothes. They are still covered with my maidenhead blood.’

Everyone examines his clothes and sees that they are covered with blood. The girl grabs him by the penis, the father and mother hold him by the waist crying ‘Sharia justice for the wedding!’ and demand the blood-price from the groom. Again some peacemakers intervene and extract more presents for the father and mother as blood-price for their daughter. As they demand more and more, the groom’s parents and relations come forward and a huge battle ensues.

‘You have stripped our boy naked and extorted money from him,’ they claim. And those present bear witness that it is so.

Again men from both sides act as mediators. The girl’s parents give substantial presents to the boy’s parents and relatives as hush-money.

Now that the two sides are reconciled, they sit down together and proceed to celebrate. From then until the morning prayer there is such rejoicing and shooting of muskets and rockets and raucousness of singing-girls and dancing-boys and musicians that Pharaoh’s drooping spirit perks up.

Such is the wedding ceremony of the Hadari fellahin. But they never allow strangers to participate. And they are very careful to preserve that Pharaonic crown. This is the permanent custom of the fellahin.





Description of the ceremony of female circumcision. A similar great celebration and wedding occurs when the girls are circumcised. Thousands of women go in grand procession, mounted on donkeys, accompanied by a musical band. They first bring the girl to the public bath, then to her house where that night female surgeons perform the operation. The girl has a reddish tongue that does not speak in the crevice of her chestnut grove. They cut out that tongue in order that desire be more eloquent.

{In fact, this female circumcision among the Hadari has come down from the time of Abraham. When the prophet Abraham was in Mecca, King Tawtis of Egypt sent him a slavegirl named Hagar as a present. Mother Sarah was jealous and one night she cut out the extraneous flesh in Mother Hagar’s vagina. It turned out, however, that the operation actually increased sexual pleasure. From that time on, the bedouin Arabs circumcise their daughters, a practice that has come down from Hagar the mother of Ishmael.}





Description of the ceremony of circumcision of boys. This is the most refined of the Egyptian ceremonies. In observance of the Sunna (or circumcision – sünnet) of the Prophet, when they are about to circumcise their sons – whether high or low, rich or poor – they help one another out.

Accompanied by an eightfold musical band are ten or fifteen or twenty little boys, bathed and smothered in gold and trinkets, with magnificent crests on their turbans, and mounted on Arab thoroughbreds. Before them in the procession go riderless horses with jewel-encrusted saddles and golden shields. At the head of the parade are old men of the quarter and surrounding neighbourhoods, bearing arms and smothered in cloth-of-gold, who pass by row on row cracking all sorts of jokes. In the midst of the troop are various highly-wrought palm tree festoons, oil-lamps, flags and banners.

Then comes the learned surgeon mounted on an Arab horse and preceded by a man bearing on his head a chest adorned with the circumcision instruments. Walking alongside the surgeon are his journeymen girded with silken waist cloths.

Just in front of the boys to be circumcised are a group of clowns and mimes, mounted on oxen and donkeys and emaciated horses – with henna on their hides, straw on their flanks and fox-tail crests on their manes – who pass with a thousand jests and pranks.

In this fashion, with band playing, they parade the boys about to be circumcised all around the marketplaces of Cairo. Rich or poor, this is what they do.

There are other festivities as well that go on for three days and three nights, with a hue and cry and feasts and pandemonium. Practically every night you can find such celebrations going on in a hundred places in Cairo. On those nights, all the streets of those quarters of the city are illuminated with thousands of oil-lamps, and food is liberally dispensed. For three months criers sent by the governor make the announcement, so the coffee shops and the eating and drinking establishments of the district remain open and there is buying and selling until the morning.

But the wedding parties are the most raucous and splendid, because they observe the Hadith: Proclaim weddings, even with tambourines. In short, they are Egypt’s pomp and circumstance, not found in other countries.





Good customs of the populace of Cairo


If a man falls ill, all the people of the quarter inquire after his health and bring presents and make sure that he has made his last will and testament. As soon as he dies, they inform the treasury agent and prepare his shroud.

All the neighbours gather in front of his door. Reciting tevhid and tezkir, they wash his body and place it in a coffin according to kanun, either one so many fingers’ length all around (? – parmaklı) or else one on the Turkish model. They adorn the coffin with roses and rose-water and sweet basil.

All the sheikhs and ulema attend the funeral procession with flags and banners, tevhid and tezkir. They first put the coffin inside the Azhar Mosque where they perform the funeral prayer, then take it to the Qarafa (burial grounds). Or else they bring it to Rumeli Square, perform the funeral prayer in the place known as Zawiyat al-Janaza or Sabil al-Mu’minin, then take it to Imam Shafi‘i or one of the twelve other cemeteries. But the most prestigious is the main Qarafa at the foot of Mt Jushi (Mt Muqattam) where one can be buried next to Benjamin the brother of Joseph or Sheikh Uqba.

The fellahin, however, bury their dead near Old Cairo (Fustat), because that is the ancient burial grounds. When the Pharaoh was in charge, he drew a wall all around that cemetery and charged a toll for every corpse that entered. The fellahin bring their coffins there accompanied by banners and followed by the womenfolk mounted on donkeys. The women pass by waving their handkerchiefs, baring their faces and tearing their hair. The coffins of the fellahin are borne on step-ladders like the hatched roofs of the infidels in Turkey. But they pay great respect to the dead, adorn the coffins, and observe the Sharia with regard to shrouding and burial and the iskat prayer.78



Another good custom is that every Friday eve (Thursday night) myriads of men and women mount their donkeys and go to visit the twelve Cairo burial grounds. They complete Koran recitals, recite Ya Sin (Sura 36), give alms to the poor and visit the dead.

The tombs are masonry-built underground vaults known as fisqiya, each one a hut of sorrows. The doors of these structures are sealed with earth and reopened whenever there is a burial. One fisqiya may contain 100 or 200 corpses. They do not cover the bodies with earth but simply place them inside, in their shrouds, so the flesh rots away and they are left as skeletons. After the burial they seal up the entrance with mortar and gypsum; because in Egypt there are very many shroud-robbers. Indeed, during the governorship of Canpoladzade Hüseyn Pasha, a number of them were apprehended and, for the sake of purging the world of evil (cf. 7:56), they were put on stakes with the shrouds they had stolen around their necks.

Every grave has a headstone engraved with the date of the deceased’s death. They also erect a variety of domes, open at the top. They pour out water and grains of wheat for the birds. They put roses and myrtles and sprigs of sweet basil on the gravestones.

On these days, a woman needs no permission from her husband in order to visit the graveyards. Nor can her husband question her about where she has been, because a stipulation to this effect was included in the marriage contract. In other matters as well, Egyptian men cannot question their wives about their whereabouts; for just as Potiphar was defeated by his wife, so nowadays the husbands of Cairo are defeated by their wives.

Such is the kanun of Egypt. In no other country is there such affection for the people of the graves.

{Another strange custom relates to the mevlud of Imam Husayn in the month of Muharram. On the night of the festival, thousands of Cairene Jews go around in groups of three, carrying large baskets with various kinds of incense. Crying their wares with fine voices, the Jews light incense and sell it. This is a custom that has come down from the time of Sitt Nafisa, ever since the head of Imam Husayn came to Egypt. At least, this is what I was told.}





How the poor of Cairo earn a living


Whatever manufactured items there are in the world, the poor of Cairo get hold of them, set them out and trade in them. They get by in this fashion.

But there are many beggars with no trade at all. On Friday and Monday eves (Thursday and Sunday nights) there are so many of these importuners in the graveyards that one can hardly walk through. If there is a well-outfitted man, one of these beggars is sure to approach and greet him and engage him in conversation. Suddenly and fearlessly he will say, ‘A‘ti ya sultanım masrufa ehli beyti’ – thus demanding that the man provide his expenses for his wife and family!

As for the poor, they do not let a man walk about the marketplace.





My adventure. One day I went into the latrines at the Mosque of Sultan Hasan in order to answer the call of nature. I shut the door and was going about my business when some fellow opened the door, stuck in his hand and asked me for alms. Since I was just wiping myself, I spared nothing but gave him whatever was in my hand.

‘May God increase your excrement,’ he said and went away.

I finished wiping myself, went out into the courtyard to renew my ablutions, then re-entered the mosque. After performing the prayer, I happened to see a friend and told him what had happened.

‘Are you crazy?’ he said. ‘May God reform you! Does one put excrement in the hand of a man like that?’

‘Well,’ said I, ‘does a man like that open the door of the latrine, while the person inside has his privates exposed, and demand money, saying Something for God?’79

‘Was he a man of blessed aspect,’ he asked, ‘with a yellow beard, of medium height, a flat forehead and a round face like a Tatar?’

‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘one with a Tatar face and a yellow beard.’

‘O cruel one!’ he said. ‘That man is the Pole (i.e., chief of the saints) of Cairo. He was testing you by showing up that way in the latrine. Why did you look at him scornfully and put excrement in his hand? And he uttered a benediction, saying, ‘May God increase your excrement.’ Be very wary of him.’

I was stunned. And indeed, I had diarrhoea for the next two months. His prayer that God increase my excrement came to pass! God be praised, through giving alms I eventually recovered my health.

78 Iskat, defined in Redhouse as alms given on behalf of the dead as compensation for their neglected religious duties.



79 Shay’an li’llah, a common demand of beggars.





11. Mevlud of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi in Tanta





Chapter 65: Stages and shrines of our journey to visit Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi in the year 1083 (1672) and our journey to the entrepôts of Damietta, Rosetta, Alexandria, and other villages and towns and cities


I had completed, as far as possible, my tours of Cairo and my visitations of its shrines, and I wished to visit also the shrine of the world-famous Pole and Father of Orphans, Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. ‘How will I manage,’ said I to myself, ‘to rub my face on that threshold and to seek succour from his noble spirit?’

As I was pondering this dilemma, by God’s wisdom, in the year 1083, on the 12th day of the month of Rabi‘ al-akhir (7 August 1672), a hubbub arose in the city, and the sounds of drums and tambourines and kettledrums, zikrs and litanies, rose to the skies. I questioned one of my friends in our house of sorrows, and he said, ‘Today is the day on which all the sheikhs and dervishes of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi gather together to perform zikr and go up to the viceroy (i.e., go up to the Cairo citadel to the palace of the Ottoman governor Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha) in order to obtain the warrant authorising the mevlud for the year (—). It is a great and boisterous procession of dervishes.’

I immediately betook myself to the court of the Pasha’s palace and, secluding myself in a corner, busied myself with watching events.

Glory to God! More than 10,000 Badawi dervishes filled up the palace square and the royal markets, playing on their drums and tambourines and displaying their pennants and banners. Some were drenched in instruments of war, with staffs or cudgels in their hands, palheng-stones and skirts at their waists,80 and zikr on their tongues.

A myriad of motley flags and banners turned the city of Cairo into a tulip garden.

In the palace square, in the Pasha’s presence, the sheikhs’ chief deputy said ‘Mention the name of God!’ and thousands of dervishes uttered their zikr with a single voice. Golden banners fluttered, drums and tambourines and small kettledrums were sounded, trumpets were blown like the trumpet of Israfil (announcing the resurrection). 3,700 sheikhs and 10,000 barefoot and bareheaded dervishes engaged in zikr. Ecstatics cried out on every side. The royal tevhid in the palace square was such that, by the Lord of the Ka‘ba, the cry of Allah Allah! reached up to the sky and the angels in heaven cried Sübhanallah (‘Praise God’) in astonished rivalry.

When this was over, and the leader of the dervishes had uttered formulas of praise to God and blessing upon the Prophet, they cried benedictions upon Sultan Mehmed IV, conqueror of Candia and Kaminiec, and lauds upon Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha, and group by group and in good order took their places before the Pasha.

Now Ibrahim Pasha issued the warrant of Sultan Qaytbay, ordering the provincial governors of Gharbiya and Manufiya, Hasan Agha and Ali Agha, along with the seven guard regiments and other janissary aghas, to attend the noble mevlud with all their soldiery fully armed; to protect the Malaqa square; to prevent the brigands of the Arab tribes from coming to the arena and bearing cudgels and akve daggers; and to close the wine and boza taverns and the houses of prostitution.

The Pasha also presented the sheikhs with gifts, more than those of previous viziers, including two green turbans for the noble tomb of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi; two batmans of aloes and 50 miskals of raw ambergris; one silken carpet and one silken prayer-rug; two beeswax candles, each the height of a man and weighing 100 batmans. To the dervishes he gave 100 gold pieces as sacrifice money, which he handed over to the chief deputy Sheikh Mustafa Rumi. The sheikhs uttered a benediction and kissed the Pasha’s hand.

The royal tevhid recommenced, so loud as to stun any deniers. When it was over, and after further benedictions and lauds, the Pasha’s servants took up his gifts – the carpet and prayer-rug, aloes and ambergris and turbans – and the chief executioner, in a loud voice, read out the warrant in the palace square and announced that the Badawi mevlud would take place in the middle of the month of Jumadi al-akhir.

Thus all the sheikhs and dervishes marched off in procession, row on row and wave on wave, and everyone returned to his abode.

At this juncture I was overcome with the urge to travel. ‘How,’ said I to myself, ‘can I perform this very important visitation?’ While I was pondering this, after the evening prayer a chamberlain came and informed me that the governor wished to see me. Immediately I went into Ibrahim Pasha’s presence, where the subject of conversation was the festival of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. Seizing the opportunity, I said, ‘My lord, if you grant me leave, this humble one and full of fault will be present at that harvest-home of prayer, where I will recall my lord with benedictions and at the same time I will have visited that shrine.’

He accepted my supplication. Summoning Nişli Ali Kethüda, he ordered that I be given 100 gold pieces as travel expenses and made me an official attendant at the Badawi mevlud. He entrusted me with the orders for the kashifs of Gharbiya and Manufiya. And it being the end of the year and the month of Tut (i.e., the first month of the Coptic calendar, corresponding to September), when the kashifs’ authority lapses, he also gave me the orders for them to come to the divan in Cairo and settle their accounts. And he entrusted me with letters of good news to Hasan Agha, the kashif of Gharbiya, appointing him deputy of the sergeants for the divan of Cairo. He also bestowed on me one well-furnished tent; ten quintals of biscuit and other supplies of food and drink, including 100 okkas of coffee and three quintals of sugar; and 100 candles.

We bid each other farewell and I proceeded to the house of Nişli Ali Kethüda. He too gave me letters addressing the kadis and kashifs and multazims81 en route, to the following effect:

The bearer of this document, Evliya Efendi, is the boon-companion and ancient friend of our viceroy, and is our own dear father. To whomever of you this love-styled letter arrives, it will please us very much if you treat Evliya Çelebi with due consideration and convey him safely and soundly from one of you to the next.





He too offered me 5,000 para as travel expenses.

I took leave of all my friends and that night was guest in the house of the delivery agent82 Ibrahim Agha in Bulaq. For three days and three nights the city of Bulaq was illuminated with myriads of oil-lamps and there were continual celebrations. On the second night, all the sheikhs attended in front of the janissaries’ lodge and the delivery agent’s palace, decorating the bank of the Nile with lamps and torches, and carrying out the imperial tevhid and noble mevlud until the morning.

The next morning, the nakibüleşraf hosted a banquet in the convent of Ibrahim Gülşeni in Bulaq, according to kanun. The great notables and ulema and sheikhs of Cairo came, in particular the kadi of the military and the şeyhülislams of the four Sunni rites, and a Muhammadan feast was consumed. That night the Gülşeni convent became the light-filled rose-garden (gülşen) of Iram, and there was a noble mevlud in the style of the above mevluds, which it would be monotonous to repeat.

The next morning, the Badawi dervishes, the ecstatic dervishes of the other Sufi brotherhoods, and the wealthy sea-going merchants, all boarded twelve aqaba ships. Each one of these holds 2,000 men – thus a sea of men rode on the river that was like a sea. These ships are similar to caravels, with stern-castles four stories high. The lowest storey is for the storage of food and drink and other provisions; the second is filled with womenfolk; the third has the dervishes and sheikhs; the fourth is filled to the brim with fellahin and sailors and servants and ship’s-captains and other pilgrims. Raised platforms and pavilions are constructed on the decks where everyone carouses and jests with his lovers and friends.

These twelve aqaba ships belong to the waqf-endowments of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. All expenses are covered by the endowment. The masts and yard-arms are all out-fitted with pennants and banners, and on all sides are thousands of oil-lamps and banners of the sheikhs.

There were several thousand additional pilgrims and sheikhs who did not board these aqaba ships but rather hired boats of their own – qayasa fishing-boats and caiques – which they boarded with their friends. These numbered 200. So the face of the Nile was adorned with boats proceeding caravan-style, the twelve aqaba ships along with 600 or 700 (!) caiques and qayasas, holding 40,000 or 50,000 men.

We set off from the city of Bulaq in mid-morning, putting our trust in God. The military personnel in all the ships fired a salute, one volley with their muskets and one volley of cannon shot. As the report died away, the Badawi chief deputy struck up the drums and kettledrums and bells and began the performance of the royal tevhid. We were carried along by the Nile current, to the sound of kettledrums and trumpets.

When the flotilla came opposite the city of Inbaba, the dervishes together sang out a Muhammadan call-to-prayer on behalf of the saint İnbaba, then each one recited a Fatiha and declared his intention of performing the Badawi visitation.

At that juncture, this humble one transferred to a smaller boat with seven or eight servants and faithful lovers. Now communing with Sheikh Mustafa Rumi, now with Sheikh Uthman Kannasi, now with Sheikh Inbabi, now with Sheikh Ahmad Qalyubi, we toured the paradise-like and prosperous villages and towns on either side of the Nile, and recorded their descriptions.

[…]





Shrine of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. Attached to the door on the right side is the wall of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. Among the domes of the side terrace on the right side of this mosque is the lofty dome of the shrine of the Lordly Pole (chief of the saints). It is round and uninterrupted like a white pearl, covered in white plaster and with a green bronze finial.



The saint himself (d. 1276) lies inside the square catafalque, made of cypress wood and covered with a Ka‘ba covering of cloth-of-gold studded with jewels. It is in the centre of that light-filled dome and surrounded by a cypress-wood railing. Each of the four corners of the catafalque is adorned with a ball of fine polished silver, the size of a man’s head.

The green turban in the middle of this square catafalque, marking the place of his blessed head, was sent by the governor of Egypt, Ebü’l-hayr Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha. 4,000 Badawi sheikhs and 20,000 Alawi dervishes83 brought the noble turban in grand procession, playing their drums and tambourines, trumpets and small kettle-drums, and performing their zikr. With a tekbir the chief deputy wrapped the turban around the station (makam – meaning the headstone?) of his blessed head. Underneath the turban they wrapped the gold-weave napkins that were on all sides. These multicoloured napkins, enough for a sultana’s dowry, had been left rotting one upon the other. Only God knows how many there were. No one but the shrine servants is allowed to touch them or remove them; the hand withered up of many a man who tried to do so.

They also lay down the carpet and prayer-rug which the Pasha had sent, and they lit the aloes and ambergris, perfuming the brains of those in the noble dome.

Above the railings that surround the catafalque are expensive chandeliers, each one worth the harac of Turkey. Among the votive gifts are silver candlesticks the height of a man, gilded and tinned copper candlesticks, gold and silver censers and rose-water sprinklers and silver scissors.



On the reading-stands inlaid with mother-of-pearl are hundreds of ancient Korans, calligraphed by Yaqut Musta‘simi and the Sheikh (Hamdullah) and Karahisari.

Suspended around the lofty dome are several hundred candles the height of a man, each one weighing three or four quintals. These candles come as gifts from the kings of the infidels. For the infidels also believe in this saint, because it often happened that thousands of captives were delivered from these kings’ prisons when their iron shackles were broken into bits, thanks to the miraculous graces of Badawi. So the iron fetters and chains, weighing 40 or 50 okkas, which these Muslim captives bore for forty or fifty years, are now suspended next to these candles, which are never lit but serve only as ornament.

The Muslim emperors of the seven climes have also sent precious gifts for the sake of a blessing, such as jewel-encrusted oil-lamps and lamp-stands, porcelain cups, ostrich eggs of various sizes, gold and silver balls and decanters. They are suspended here too, in countless numbers.

The world-travelling lovers have also left behind mementoes, such as a dervish staff, palheng-stone, drum and tambourine, trumpet and bell, sling of David, banner and lamp, braids and feathers and bells, a hatchet of Abu Muslim, headgear of various sorts, a begging-bowl, fire-stick, water-pot and ribbons, leathern apron, dervish woolen cloaks, wooden swords, curiously shaped fish-bones, leathern knapsacks, and things of this sort that are the equipment of dervishes. Each of these items was hanging in a corner, and 1,001 items besides.

Every master calligrapher has left a handwriting sample here adorning the walls. This humble one also, with my usual impertinence, wrote the Koranic verse, Nor can I succeed without God’s help (11:88), in large letters on a plaque and deposited it by the side of the prayer-niche.

Within this lofty dome, in the corner containing Badawi’s blessed head, is the imprint of the Prophet’s foot on black granite. It is visible in that corner; it is not inside the catafalque. All the pilgrims rub their faces on it and say Intercession, O Messenger of God!

All around the dome are windows with bronze gratings that look out onto the public thoroughfare.

The prayer-niche is small but highly-wrought with tiny stones like mother-of-pearl inlay.

Around the dome are varicoloured glass panes.

The cupboards of this shrine contain so many precious jewelled vessels and ancient Korans and waqf-endowment documents that only God knows their number.

The door of this light-filled dome opens eastward to the courtyard of the mosque. The door leaves are covered with silver roses and sequins and rings and varicoloured silver bosses attached with nails. Every generous patron has adorned this sublime door with some work of art. The frame is painted porcelain and the surrounding wall is covered with varicoloured tiles. Over the lintel the following chronogram is written in large letters on a round plaque of gilded marble: Our lord Sultan Qaytbay, may his victory be perfect, ordered the construction of this holy place in the year (—).

He who performs two prostrations of prayer in the prayer-niche of this light-filled dome will be protected from all vicissitudes of fate; no foe will stand up against him; and he will never see the face of poverty.

And if a murderer or thief or debtor takes refuge in this shrine from fear of the magistrate, he cannot be touched or apprehended. If he has in fact committed a crime and deserves punishment, he will not last there forty days but will waste away and die of hunger. But if he is innocent, he has nothing to fear and will go free.

Indeed, during the governorship of Ibrahim Pasha, a kashif who had a debt outstanding to the state treasury ran away and took refuge in the shrine of Badawi. Ibrahim Pasha twice sent officers to apprehend him, but they did not dare to and left.

One day, a brute of an officer from the müteferrika corps named Ali Agha came and berated the sheikhs in charge – Sheikh Salama and Sheikh Ahmad – waving the warrant in their face and demanding they turn over the kashif.

‘Bring him forth from the shrine immediately,’ he said. ‘Otherwise, by the head of my efendi, I will clap you in irons and take you to the presence of the vizier.’

He went on in this Pharaoh-like fashion. But the sheikhs responded, ‘God forbid, we cannot remove him. Here are the keys, go and open the door, if you dare, and arrest the kashif according to the vizier’s order.’

‘What have I to do with keys?’ he said. ‘You must open the door and hand the fellow over to me. Otherwise I will break the door down and take him out and put him in chains.’

This humble one happened to be present. ‘Come now, Ali Agha,’ I said. ‘Don’t act like that. Take the keys.’

After much counsel of this sort, he eventually took the keys, but after expending much effort for a full hour he was unable to open the door. Roused to anger, he and his henchmen wrenched the blessed door out of its socket, removed the kashif by force, and dragged him kicking and screaming to the sheikhs’ assembly. All present were in a state of shock, murmuring God is sufficient for me! I too was dumbfounded. Sheikh Salama counselled patience and gentleness and went home.

The aforementioned officer and his henchmen mounted and left. But as soon as they set foot outside Tanta, on the road to the village of Tuh Nasara, Ali Agha was overcome with colic and, moaning and groaning, gave up the ghost then and there.

The next thing we saw was the kashif and the agha’s henchmen bringing the corpse back to Tanta. They buried him in the cemetery. The kashif returned to the shrine and stayed there. One of Ali Agha’s henchmen abandoned the world and remained in a corner of solitude as a Badawi dervish.

When I reported this event to the Pasha, he sent an order freeing the kashif and also gave the dervishes in the shrine 10,000 para as alms. In short, he is a mighty saint, one of those who dispose as they will, may his noble secret be sanctified.

[…]





The mevlud of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi in the city of Tanta It is held in a valley between the town of Tanta and the town of Mahallat al-Marhum, 3,000 paces distant from each. Beginning twenty days before the breaching of the Nile in Cairo, all the shopkeepers and merchants make their way to Tanta, group by group. On either side of the main road going out of the city, and half way to Mahallat al-Marhum, they start to set up thousands of shops and coffee-houses, using tents, reed-mats and reeds, carpets and embroidered kilims.

Next come the Badawi sheikhs. In that arena of delight north of the city, next to these miniature markets, first the twelve vicars of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi take up quarters in their jerry-built pasha-pavilions, laid out tent rope to tent rope along with the tents of their dervishes, according to the kanun of the Abu’l-Al Ahmadi (the clan of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi).

First, according to sheikhly protocol, they set up the tents of Sheikh Mustafa Rumi – he is sheikh of the Marzuq Kifafi brotherhood, which however derives from the Badawi. Then come those of Sheikh Inbabi, Sheikh Kannasi, Sheikh Shinnawi with his 10,000 dervishes, Sheikh Ahmad Qalyubi, Sheikh Uthman, and Sheikh Ghamrawi. In sum, first the vicars take up quarters in their proper places, then whatever other sheikhs arrive find a place as well.

Following the sheikhs, the kashif of Manufiya sets up his tent-pavilion with his 1,000 chosen troops, armed and mustered. Their sheikhs (!) undertake to guard the camp bazaars, which they patrol every night with so many soldiers and, if they find a rogue or bandit, put him to death in summary fashion.

Day after day a sea of men throng to this happy valley – from India and Yemen, Ethiopia, Persia, and Aden – settling with bag and baggage in tents and pavilions, joined tent rope to tent rope, so the plain becomes a tulipgarden of tents and banners.

On day six, according to the decree of the vizier of Egypt, the kashif of Gharbiya arrives with his 2,000 troops, 1,000 Arab horsemen, and 500 boys on foot, with cudgels in their hands, serving as military guards. They march in beating their drums, raising up their dragon-imaged banners, and shaking their horse-tail standards like the locks of a lovely lad. The kashif of Manufiya comes out to greet him with his soldiery fully armed and striking his kettledrums.

The kashif of Manufiya, however, does not have a five-layered military band like the kashif of Gharbiya. The latter is at the rank of beylerbey, occupying the throne of Tahir Baybars (i.e., the Mamluk sultan al-Malik al-Zahir Baybars, reg. 1260-77), so he takes precedence; although he does not take precedence over the governor of Girga, whose rank is higher than Upper Egypt (!).

Then the kashif of Manufiya stood up to greet the kashif of Gharbiya and their two troops paraded in grand procession from the Malaqa square, through a sea of men. When the two kashifs had taken up quarters in their tent pavilions, this humble one mounted with my retinue and presented the gifts sent by Ibrahim Pasha.

Also the orders he sent were read out, one of which was: ‘You who are the kashif of Gharbiya, Hasan Agha: after the Badawi mevlud you will proceed to the Threshold of Egypt (i.e. the divan in Cairo) to settle your account and carry out my noble command.’

Another was: ‘You who are the magistrate of Gharbiya: you will supervise the noble mevlud of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi, which takes place in your province, until its dispersal, giving protection to all the pilgrims and merchants. You will prevent the brigands of the Arab tribes from riding about on horseback in the Mal‘aba (‘Playground’) arena with their javelins and swords and akve daggers, and will punish such malefactors.’

When these orders were read out, they cried: ‘To hear is to obey!’

I also gave him the letter of the Pasha’s deputy, which was to the following effect, ‘The viceroy has appointed you deputy of the sergeants for the divan of Cairo. Give Evliya Çelebi one horse with saddle and one Egyptian purse. It will please us if you treat him with due consideration and convey him back to us in happy condition.’

When this letter was read out publicly, he presented me one Arab horse with silver trappings and gilded stirrups and blanket; one other horse with its horse cloth; one purse as reward for bringing good news; 5,000 para as a gratuity for bringing the order; and one additional horse as a tip. He furnished me a tent next to his tent-pavilion where I stayed as his guest three days and three nights, partying and carousing. After that I was guest in the house of the sheikhs’ chief deputy for ten more days.

Once these two kashifs had taken up quarters in the arena of the mevlud, there was a great sense of safety and security. All the merchants and pilgrims brought out their goods and displayed them openly. The amount of buying and selling that went on was phenomenal. And everyone decorated the front of his tent or pavilion with lamps and pennants and flags and standards.

In fact, there is a terrace in the arena of the mevlud where Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi used to pray whenever he sought solitude outside of the city – it is called the Station of Badawi and is still a place of worship. Here, for the sake of a blessing, a certain benefactor planted a ship’s mast, 80 cubits high, with thousands of ship’s ropes stretched all around it. Every night of the celebration they string 40,000 oil-lamps on these ropes, illuminating the surroundings in grand fashion. It is something like a vizier’s tentpavilion with a central pillar. At the very top of the mast is a Catherine wheel that turns like the revolving sphere of heaven. It uses as many as 1,000 oil-lamps. When viewed from some distance away, it appears that a light emerges from the pavilion and settles on the arena. In the Arab regions this kind of lamp display is termed eşare. It requires forty attendants to operate it and burns 10 quintals of sesame oil every night. The benefactor has endowed 20,000 para for the fifteen nights of this display. It is a ‘bride’ that has to be seen, as though it were the royal pavilion of Pythagoras the Monotheist.

They have similar eşares, large and small, in thousands of places – with oil-lamps figured in the pattern of a tent-pavilion or prayer-niche or pulpit or Seal of Solomon or sun disc or cup or squash – that illuminate this arena of delight.

But especially in the year that we witnessed this event, when the sheikhs went to the presence of Ibrahim Pasha in order to get permission for the noble mevlud, the Pasha warned them, ‘O sheikhs and efendis! I have high expectations of you. This year watch out that you perform the mevlud of the Prophet with even greater celebrations than last year. For those celebrations are the emblems of Islam!’

‘Upon our heads, we will do it, O vizier!’ they replied.

News of this warning spread among the Egyptians, who spared no effort or expense to carry out the Pasha’s wishes. They are in any case given to pleasure and enjoyment, and celebrating is second nature with them.

So this year the notables of the entire province of Egypt, as well as those of Damascus and Aleppo, and the Arabs and Persians more generally, assembled for the Badawi mevlud in such numbers that, aside from Bedouin tents and kilim-shelters and huts, there were counted 1,700 tents and pup-tents and royal tent-pavilions. Only God knows the number of huts-of-sorrows of the poorer sort (or dervishes).

And many benefactors set up water-dispensaries, consisting of large earthenware jars, at crossroads. For water is scarce in this arena. There are some wells, to be sure, but not enough for so many myriads of people in mid-summer. As for the Nile, it is an hour’s distance from this arena, in the direction of Mahallat al-Marhum.

The two kashifs with their soldiery keep guard day and night over all the pilgrims. And in every quarter guards are furnished by the Egyptian notables and their retinues. For in such a huge gathering, vermin of every stripe, members of the Harami and Juzami (rival clans) and other tribal riffraff are always present. Every day in this Mal‘aba arena 10,000 or 15,000 naked Arabs stand ready with their spears bristling like a forest. Sometimes the Harami and Juzami clansmen seize the opportunity to kidnap one another in this open field, or do battle with one another, and hundreds of brigands get killed on each side. But the quarrels quickly subside due to the spirituality of Badawi.

So the pilgrims set up camp here, tent rope to tent rope, making a fortress of tents. That is why the kashifs’ soldiery stand ready. For in these days in this arena there are hundreds of Egyptian treasures worth of property. That is how great a gathering it is.

In fact, Kashif Hasan Agha’s chief equerry and chief camel-driver, outfitting the spare horses with weapons and the camels with flags and banners and fine garments of many colours, go around from shop to shop and extract a one para toll from each one. They told me they had taken patrol-money from 5,060 shops, and if they could go into the town they would have got 5,000 akçe more. That is how prosperous a gathering it is.

These shops all consist of tents and reed mats and reeds. No shops are more popular than the ones selling dried chickpeas. For Badawi chickpeas are taken as presents to all the regions of Islam. Thousands of camel loads of raw chickpeas come here and are dried to make this product.

There are 600 coffee houses, 300 cookshops, 200 butchers, 50 herbalists, 100 fritter shops, 100 bread shops, 200 boza shops, 500 sherbet shops, and hundreds of other types of shops adorning this arena of affection. While only God the Concealer of faults knows the number of shopless men peddling their wares.

Larger marketplaces are found in seventy places. For example, there is a bazaar for baked bread, one for (dried?) fruit, another with thousands of camel loads of melons and watermelons and abdüllavi melons; and bazaars for horses, sheep, cattle, camels, mules, and donkeys. The trumpeting noise of braying animals in the donkey bazaar is enough to drive one crazy.

There is also a bazaar for bedouin cloaks, one for Maghrebi stuffs, and one for white and coloured cloth and thread – this last is frequented by men and women both.

Speaking of women, there is a special bazaar for them – over 1,000 tents and huts of fornication, where women’s skirts are lifted and men’s breeches are untied, and the women are auctioned off to the highest bidder.

And there is a bazaar for boys in every coffee house, where pretty boys are on display, with earrings on their ears and their doe-like eyes smeared with collyrium. This is a special bazaar of filth, especially frequented by the Hadari fellahin. One or two thousand such men forgather in every coffee house and raise a ruckus beyond description. Day and night a thousand boy dancers prance about with coquettish gestures, catching the hearts of lovers in the traps of their flowing locks. Other groups of entertainers – singers, instrumentalists, ghazal-reciters, itinerant musicians, mimics, eulogists, comedians, mimes and buffoons – are everywhere, conducting as it were sessions of Husayn Bayqara.

Also in this town of Tanta is a playground for jereed shooting. It is kept completely clear: there are no tents and pavilions, no animals grazing, not even a stone the size of a bean that might strike a horse’s hoof. Before dawn, in the cool of the morning, all the cavalrymen gather there with their thoroughbreds to perform their equestrian exercises and play their games with seventy-seven kinds of weapons. On one side they hurl spears, on the other side clash with cudgels or swords. They fire their muskets or practice archery on horseback; gallop their horses while standing up on the horses’ backs or crouching down with their hands on the stirrups and legs in the air; and display their skills in Egyptian-style jereed and other games. For all of which they are rewarded by the kashifs. And all of this takes place to the beating of Ottoman drums on one side and kettledrums on the other.

Until the heat of the day, this arena is the site of many a spectacle that can only be appreciated by someone who himself rides horses and girds on swords. In fact, the Lord of Power has created the horse out of wind, and to perform such feats while mounted on wind is truly a heroic deed. These equestrian arts are peculiar to the Egyptian cavaliers; no kings on earth can rival them.

This humble one takes great pleasure at watching such exercises on wind-swift steeds. For I saw five or ten turns each of cudgel-play and swordplay and archery during the time when Murtaza Pasha was ensconced in Revan.84 For this reason I greatly enjoy watching equestrian exercises, and so I have recorded them here.

Once this Mal‘aba arena is free of the cavaliers, it is the turn of whatever entertainers and acrobats there are on the face of the earth to display their skills.

First come several hundred lovers of the Sa‘di and Badawi brotherhoods who, to still their own ardour, lick red-hot irons with their tongues and break and knead them with their hands. Some even take the pieces of iron that are glowing like carnelians and, crying Ya Hay! swallow them. Then come the fire-eaters, tumblers, jugglers, rope-dancers, shadow-puppeteers; players with bottles or bowls or jars or jugs or goblets; beads players and gamblers; tricksters with straps; trainers of donkeys, roosters and monkeys; strong-men, cudgel-wielders, mace-wielders, sword-swallowers; mirror-conjurors; alchemists; trainers of dogs, goats, bears, human beings, and cows; snake-charmers – in short, seventy-seven guilds of prestidigitators whose feats, were I to record them as I witnessed them, would require an entire volume.

The huge gaping crowd in this arena provides a ripe opportunity for pickpockets. So one has to be cautious, since they have picked the pocket of many a heedless innocent and bankrupted many a foolish man. People speak of stealing the eye-salve from an eye, but the thieves of Egypt aren’t like that, rather they steal an eye and leave the eye-salve in its place. Such masters are they of the pickpocket trade. For there are many wondrous sights in this arena, and if you get caught up in the spectacle and pay no heed to who is around you, you can end up naked. God preserve us from the evil of mankind.





A marvellous feat. This humble one applauded all the entertainers whom I watched in this Mal‘aba arena. But the ones I admired the most were the snake-charmers, who made the snakes dance like monkeys. They were huge and fearful creatures, dragon-like, as thick as one’s arm, and Faruq vipers.

The strange thing is that each snake has a name. If a snake-charmer calls to one and say ‘Come,’ it comes and hurls itself onto him, slithers up his shoulder and into and out of his bosom. If he says ‘Go,’ it goes away. If a snake makes a mistake and comes when he has called a different one, he takes the snake that doesn’t know its name and hurls it at a giant yellow snake nearby, which wraps it in a deadly embrace.

The snake-charmer beats a rhythm with his tambourine, in the segah musical mode, and amazingly, the snakes dance precisely to that rhythm, not departing from it one jot. Certain snakes, while they are dancing, raise up their heads to a man’s height, flatten out their necks, stick out their tongues and make their eyes red.

On that day, I noticed that snakes never shut their eyes, because they have no eyelids. Grasshoppers also lack eyelids and so their eyes are always open. And some snakes wrestle with each other, intertwining and embracing.

This snake-charmer has a kind of Faruq drug that renders the snake unconscious as soon as he touches it to the snake’s nose. Anyone who gets hold of some of this Faruq can set himself up as a snake-charmer and make a living. In short, snake-charming is something at the level of a saintly miracle.





A marvel. One day while a snake-charmer was making some snakes dance in this arena, a Badawi dervish who happened to be present went crazy and screamed ‘Allah!’ The snakes became agitated and started fleeing into their bags. But before they could get away, the dervish grabbed hold of one and began to eat it. The poor snake twisted and turned, and wrapped itself round his arm; but the dervish gave no quarter and continued to eat it. All the spectators were aghast. The snake-charmer cried, ‘O people of Muhammad! O you Muslims! He has eaten my prize dancing snake, the one I trained for twelve years. He has eaten my snake that provides me a living for my family.’

He collared the Badawi dervish and a struggle ensued. The dervish’s eyes turned to bowls of blood (signifying rage). Without a qualm, he ate up the snake, quite raw. Finally the snake-charmer hauled the Badawi before the Sharia court.

‘My lord,’ he said to the kadi, ‘he ate my prize snake. My livelihood was bound up with that snake. I earned a living and paid what I owed to the tax agent. I demand justice!’ Such was his plea.

‘Why did you eat the snake?’ the kadi asked the Badawi.

‘Truly, my lord,’ he replied, ‘a fat snake and delicious, but one accursed and vicious, my lord.’

The kadi asked the snake-charmer how much the snake was worth, and the charmer told him ten guruş. The kadi reconciled him to one gold piece. The Badawi gave him one gold piece, wiped his mouth, and left.

That is the kind of snake-charming that goes on in this arena of affection.





Another marvel. A Badawi dervish wearing a woolen cloak had a rooster that he made dance in this arena. The rooster had a horn on its head in front of its comb. It always sat on the Badawi’s head. Whenever someone gave the rooster a para, it swallowed it, then beat its wings and gave a cock’s crow, but a cock’s crow the likes of which I have never heard. Then the Badawi said, ‘Say, O rooster, that God is one!’

The rooster immediately beat its wings three times and said in a loud voice, ‘There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.’ And as God is my witness, it enunciated every letter perfectly. Then it danced in a circle three times on the ground and once again took up its position on the Badawi’s head.

It was a marvellous spectacle. But they told me that the Badawi was an individual suspected of miraculous powers. Also that the rooster swallowed up to 1,000 para a day in this gathering; in the evening it defecated the coins, and the rooster-father took them and spent them.

Another marvel was a show of white magic that we witnessed in this arena of contention. A certain Nasr al-din Tanjawi from (Tangiers in) the Maghreb, a master magician, invited all the great notables who were in their tents, each with a green leaf (for cleaning teeth?) and a toothpick, to come to the arena, which became packed with people. Together with his attendants, he struck a flourish on the tambourine and drove a stake into the ground.

Now from his knapsack of love, he took out several red cannonballs, the size of an orange, and began to juggle with them. Then he took out three larger balls from the Sea of Grace (i.e., the knapsack) and showed his skill with them. He rolled one of them in front of the spectators and let them examine it and kick it. It made the rounds of the arena as though it were being played in a game of polo. The magician then took it and, as he tossed it in the air, a rope seemed to unravel from it. He gave the end of the rope to one of the spectators, who pulled it and pulled it, then tied it to the stake in the ground. The strange thing was that the ball was the size of a man’s head, but the rope that unravelled from it was enough for a porter’s load.

Once the rope was tied to the stake, the magician threw the ball high in the air, where it stayed suspended with the rope in between, one end at the stake and the other end at the ball. Now he grasped the rope with his hand and shook it, crying, ‘Come down, O red ball, come down!’ He addressed the ball in this fashion several times, but it stayed in the air and would not descend. Some stalwart youths among the spectators joined his own attendants and kept pulling on the rope, until there were three skeins of rope piled up at their feet, but still the ball would not descend. As they kept pulling, the rope kept getting thicker, so what started as thin as a cord became as thick as a hawser. The entire audience was amazed.

The magician once again addressed the ball, telling it to come down. After some conversation with the ball, he addressed the audience and said, ‘O people of Muhammad! The ball says, ‘I have put on such a fine show, now let all the notables, my aghas, give my master one Egyptian para each; then I will come down and do some more tricks.’ So, you lovers, we desire one speck of silver from each of you.’

He collected 10,000 para from the great notables. Then he grasped the rope again and shook it. ‘O ball!’ he said, ‘Your wish is fulfilled – may God grant it as a blessing. We have come up with a purse of para. So now it’s time to come down.’ Still the ball would not descend.

‘O Muslims!’ he said. ‘Let all of you request the ball to come down.’ Everyone great and small clapped their hands and shouted, ‘Come down! come down!’

At once the ball started swaying back and forth, and descended to the ground. The magician picked it up and put it in his knapsack. The ropes piled on the ground turned out to be thin thread. He put it all in his sack and proceeded to perform some other tricks.

I found each one of them astounding. With my faulty intellect, however, I speculated that the above mentioned ball was full of dew, which has the property of turning into air when it is exposed to heat; and when he threw the ball into the air, the heat of the day was extreme. By the time he had finished his patter and collected his coins, the dew had all dissipated, and the ball fell to the ground. Otherwise, my trifling intellect could not comprehend it, but I gathered it by means of knowledge of certainty (102:5 – i.e., by deduction, not ocular evidence). Making the ropes appear thick as hawsers, however, is a trick of alchemy.

In (10)74 (1663) after the conquest of Uyvar, I saw a magician in the city of (—) in Austria who also kept a ball suspended in mid-air in this fashion. He was a great magician, and his tricks have been described in detail. But this magician in the Badawi arena also performed noteworthy feats. If I recorded everything that I witnessed, it would require a large volume.

In various corners of this Tanta arena are set up swings, merry-go-rounds, cradles, litters, Catherine wheels and carousels. Great and small, lovers and beloveds, mount the swings and swing back and forth to the sound of drums and shawms. The days of the Badawi mevlud are like festival days, the blessed nights like the Night of Power. There are also gatherings in tents where the faithful lovers celebrate with drum and tambourine and small kettledrum, tevhid and tezkir. And on every side are thousands of cauldrons in which delicious foods are cooked, and people eating and drinking. But, by God’s wisdom, if any wine should enter this arena, it turns to vinegar by the secret of Badawi. There are boza houses, however, and apricot sherbets. But the sherbets of licorice, barberry, tamarind and treacle are especially fine. It is a divine wisdom that wine in this arena turns to vinegar.

Amidst all the hubbub and commotion, the sheikhs and dervishes of the Sufi brotherhoods go off troop by troop – beating their drums and tambourines, jangling their bells, raising up their standards, shouting aloud and performing zikr, the dervishes dancing – to visit the tomb of Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi. Then the thoroughfares are so crowded that sometimes a woman or child has been trampled to death in sight of the holy shrine. Even the pilgrimage visitations of Mecca and Medina do not get this crowded, except when the Noble House (i.e., the Ka‘ba) is opened, but then after an hour things settle down. This Badawi visitation, however, goes on for ten days and nights, and it is like the gathering of the Last Judgement. Shoulder rubs shoulder, with everyone crying Hu! and Hayy al-Qayyum! and performing zikr.

In this arena, certain wealthy individuals among the great notables outfit their tents and pavilions with silk carpets and brocades, satins and velvets, Indian cushions with embroidered needlework and mottled velvet pillows and curtains, also various kinds of weapons and expensive chandeliers. The front of each tent is decorated with 100 or 150 poles topped with flags. Oil-lamps and torches provide illumination. The tents are decked out with pennants and standards, like so many idol-temples of China. Night and day there are private parties and intimate conversations, where benedictions are uttered for the continuance of the Ottoman state.

The sheikhs as well decorate their tents with myriads of oil-lamps and flags, as they engage in their worship. In short, whatever sort of pleasure you may desire can be found in this Badawi mevlud. But – in accordance with the verse:

In the world of multiplicity take pleasure in unity



And look to the Beloved.



Make your heart pure like a mirror



And gaze at the Beloved’s face.





– the knower of God is he who looks closely at the world’s adornment and is not deceived thereby, who in the midst of multiplicity takes pleasure in unity, and amidst transience polishes the mirror of his heart so that it will reflect eternity. For the trinkets and ornaments of this world are of a day, and the sound and fury are gone tomorrow; as in the Koranic verse: Your worldly riches are transitory, but God’s reward is everlasting (16:96). So while those concerned with appearances go in one direction and sleep the sleep of heedlessness, those concerned with inner truths, who are the knowers of God, are awake at midnight performing royal tevhid and remembering the Eternal One.

In numerous places noble mevlud-poems and odes in praise of the Prophet are recited by cantors and eulogists, with fine voices that delight the cherubs in heaven and the children of fairies and of men on earth. And because this plain is embellished with countless lamps and torches, every night is like the fourteenth of the month (when the moon is full) or is bright as day. So there is something to occupy everyone during all these nights; as in the verse:

When the Eternal revealed Himself



And did the world create



He gave each creature consolation



In one or another state.





There is another group of men in this arena of delight whose job it is to set off muskets and rockets and various types of fireworks. Over the ten nights there are elaborate displays – with firecrackers, basilisks, kingfishers, butterflies, rams, falcons, chestnuts, peacocks, roosters, horses, castles, priests, Jews, demons, fairies, beauties, jets, mortars, waterspouts, bats, moths, rocket-donkeys, dogs and water buffaloes – imaged forth from rockets, lanterns filled with gunpowder and naphtha, Catherine wheels, tents of fire. The crowds get frightened at these animals. There is a hue and cry like the clamour of India. Dark night is bright as day, and the city of Tanta remains like a salamander (i.e., unburnt) in the midst of the flames.

The first three days of these fireworks displays are at the charge of the kashifs of Gharbiya and Manufiya, who out-rival one another, spending each night 2,000 guruş on rockets that sometimes set tents ablaze. This is an ancient kanun going back to the time of Sultan Qaytbay who used to attend the Badawi mevlud in person and spend great sums on its celebrations.

In sum, this humble one, the globetrotter Evliya, has spend forty-one years journeying throughout the eighteen empires, but I have never seen anything like the Sultanate of Egypt.

I have been fortunate to witness the breaching of the blessed Nile in Cairo; imperial wedding and circumcision festivities in Istanbul; the decking out of the admiral’s fleet on the sea at Sarayburnu (the Topkapı Palace promontory); celebrations for the conquest of castles and the birth of Ottoman princes; festivities when the Sultan returned from performing gaza; the hoopla in Kağıthane in Istanbul in the months of Rajab and Sha‘ban; parties on the Bosphorus for the Judas tree flowering in Göksu, the cherry season in Rumeli Hisar, and the season (of white cherries and chestnuts) in Akbaba Sultan (in Beykoz); The gunpowder festival in Pécs in the province of Buda (in Hungary); the garden seasons of Meram in Konya and Azpuzu in Malatya; the summer-pasture paradise of Istanaz in the Antalya region; the promenade of Büzürg Seng in the city of Elbasan in Albania; the fairs of Doyran, Maskoluri, Alasonya and Ösek; the ful (?) of Lonçat (Rotterdam?) in Germany; the orchard of Sudak in Kaffa; Penç Hasan near Irak-ı Dadyan in Dagestan; in Persia, the bazaar of Gilan, the shrine of Imam Riza in Mashhad (!) and the Ashura ceremonies for the martyrdom of Husayn in Tabriz; and in Baghdad, the annual ceremonies at the shrines of Salman Pak, Imam Husayn and Imam Ali.

Yes, I have been vouchsafed in the course of my travels to see all of these pilgrimage sites and visitations, tourist attractions and promenades, grand gatherings and celebrations that are the envy of kings and the adornment of the world. But if all of these that I have listed were gathered into one, they would only make up one particle of the festivities at the Badawi mevlud and would perhaps answer to one day or one night of that festival.

The reason for its magnificence is that the majestic Badawi is a mighty saint, one of those who dispose as they will, even now as in his lifetime. Indeed he has not died; for this noble Hadith pertains to the great saints and believers: Those who believe do not die but are transported from the abode of transience to the abode of eternity. We believe in this noble Hadith – The messenger of God has spoken true – and are certain that he is alive and that this grand assembly takes place at his behest.

The rulers of this world have myriads of servitors in their employ. When they wish to assemble an army, they can do so by force, pressing men into service and massacring those who resist. But such huge numbers of God’s creatures from Hind and Sind, Arabia and Persia and Turkey, come at great expense to themselves, abandoning their possessions and their families and undertaking the journey, in order to rub their faces at the threshold of Badawi and celebrate his mevlud crying Ya Badawi! And, by God above, anyone who does rub his face just once at that lofty threshold is cured of various illnesses, is protected from guile and bewitchment, and is free of all pain and fear and danger. This is tried and tested.

There is one other grand gathering that is comparable to this one, and that is the Mina bazaar in Mecca when the pilgrims return from Mt Arafat. 70,000 pilgrims gather there for three days and three nights. Indeed, as regards religious merit, as well as the sheer number of men and animals, the Mina bazaar festival is even greater than the Badawi mevlud. In that arena of delight, the soul experiences a different kind of expansiveness and inward joy, since all except God is far from one’s consciousness and only the veil of modesty remains between everyone and his Lord. For there, everyone is as innocent as when he emerged from his mother’s womb; as is signified by the noble Hadith: He who repents of his sin is as though he has never sinned. He finds his Lord, and he experiences the unity in multiplicity that is the goal at Mecca and Medina as it is at Badawi.

But the Pole of Poles (i.e. Seyyid Ahmad al-Badawi) is himself present every year at the Badawi mevlud, as has been witnessed many times. You may object that after so many people have gathered in one place, there is all sorts of rubbish and filth. That is true, but it is the way of the world. And he is a deep ocean and the Greatest Help (gavs-ı a‘zam, a title of the greatest saint) – rubbish does not cause any harm to the ocean. And anyone tainted by corrupt and scandalous deeds, in that great place is certain to be reformed. Such a master of the grand gathering is he, the Father of Orphans – may his spiritual effort by ever present.

On the eighth day of this Badawi mevlud, criers circulate among the pilgrims to announce that on Friday in the city of Nahariya will be the noble mevlud of Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zayn. As soon as they hear this, some pilgrims and merchants strike their tents and shops on Thursday and move to Nahariya.

During the days of the festival, 1,000 camel loads of dried chickpeas and several thousand quintals of halva are sold in the bazaar of the Badawi mevlud. This is no exaggeration; for all the visitors that come from the various regions of Islam must take home chickpeas, as a blessing, when they return to their countries. They are indeed quite delicious. They sprinkle sesame oil on the raw chickpeas and bake them in red-hot sand. It is a process found nowhere else, which gives the chickpeas a distinctive flavour and makes them world-famous. They also make a kind of lokum (Turkish delight) with (sesame) oil, cut up in small pieces like ‘pilgrims’ lokum’, that is also considered a blessing and is taken as gifts to all the countries.

The following day, Friday, all the kashifs and the soldiery, fully armed, assemble at the tent-pavilion of the kashif of Gharbiya and consume a huge Muhammadan spread. Each of the colonels of the Gharbiya guards gets a gratuity consisting of one horse and one camel. The Gharbiya troops take their leave, amidst prayers and blessings, and everyone makes his way to his home town or village, having served for six months.

Towards noon, the Muhammadan spread is the turn of the kashif of Manufiya. He too has a great feast, and his colonels too get one horse and one camel apiece as gratuity. Having received Sharia vouchers that they have performed their service, they take their leave and go off to their homes.

Now the kashif of Gharbiya and Manufiya proceed with their own soldiery to the shrine of Badawi. They open the cloak room and have one of the sheikhs put on a Badawi cloak and turban, then they parade him through the city in grand procession. They perform the Friday worship at the mosque of Sheikh Ibrahim Matbuli. As they conduct him back to the shrine, everyone comes out on the street to watch the parade and greet the sheikh. Back at the shrine he removes the cloak and turban and secludes himself once again in his cell. The kashifs receive Sharia vouchers that they have performed their service, make a farewell visit, and head off for Cairo.

The reason for all this is that when the Badawi mevlud breaks up, Tanta is left as a frontier zone. The Nile submerges the countryside; the kashifs are left without authority; deputies and representatives seize control; and the naked Bedouin brigands begin their banditries.

Now the tents and pavilions in this Badawi arena start to be dismantled. This too is a noteworthy scene, full of commotion. Myriads of horses and mules, camels and donkeys move off with their loads, and after a great deal of shouting and toing and froing, not a single pilgrim is left in this plain. For once the kashifs in charge have taken their leave and are gone, the pilgrims and merchants are fearful of the bedouin vermin. This too is a day of terror. The world becomes a kind of shadow-puppet theatre. One moment there is pandemonium, the next moment not a fly remains in this valley. Where is that grand gathering, that hue and cry? It is scattered in a trice, and in its place only ants and snakes. Truly, the pomp of this world is no more substantial than a dream. One should take a lesson from this as well.

The (leading sheikhs or) vicars decamp from this plain and remove to the city of Tanta. For on Saturday they purify the shrine of Badawi and that night assemble in that gate of felicity and perform a noble mevlud that is attended, so they say, by the spirits of all the saints. And that night the sheikhs and dervishes complete more than 1,000 Koran recitals.

The next day, the sheikhs and dervishes too make their farewell visit and everyone sets out for his own dwelling. Those sheikhs and dervishes who attend the shrine now clean it with rose-water, wash every stone of the noble courtyard, cover the floor with silk carpets, and resume their life of quiet.

On the following day, the citizens open a channel of the Qarnayn Canal in the territory of Manuf and – glory to God! – the blessed Nile comes billowing and submerges the entire plain where the Badawi mevlud took place. All the rubbish that was left behind is swept away, and that plain becomes a sea. It is as though no one ever set foot in this open field. This too is a noteworthy event.

This humble one took careful note of thousands of sights in this city of Tanta. When my tour was complete, I bid farewell to all my friends, Sheikh Salama and Sheikh Ahmad the vicar and Sheikh Çelebi, and all the imams and preachers. I completed one last Koran recital in the shrine of Badawi, seeking succour from his noble spirit, and performed the farewell visit. Then I kissed the threshold, according to protocol, and set out for the city of Nahariya.

12. Mountain of the Birds





Description of the Mountain of the Birds


{It is also called Mt Taylimun.} It is a wondrous spectacle. The tongue falls short at describing this great mountain. Every year in the spring several hundred thousand birds of various kinds – but mainly storks and goldfinches – come from the direction of Turkey and settle on this mountain. The mountain plains swarm with them, so that one can hardly find a place to set one’s foot, and their cries are loud enough to make one’s gall-bladder burst. The people of the region are aware of the spectacle and come to view it from a distance; but no one can seize any of the birds or throw stones at them.

On top of the mountain, on a sandy plain, is a cemetery. Each sarcophagus contains thousands of birds of various sorts – but mainly storks – buried in their shrouds (i.e. mummified). The (living) birds all come to visit this cemetery, circling above it and squawking and lamenting. Then they land in the mountain plains. Most of the buried birds are visible outside the graveyard. Their bodies and feathers are fresh and undecayed inside their shrouds, which are made of date-palm fibres.

No one knows the reason why these birds are buried here in their shrouds. Nor have I seen it mentioned in any of the histories. This humble one actually brought two of these mummified birds to Kethüda Ibrahim Pasha so he could see them.

After resting for one night, the birds arise at the crack of dawn and raise such a hue and cry that – glory to God! – one might think all hell broke loose. There is a huge cave on this mountain. As soon as the sun rises, all the birds take wing and, with a great clamour, circle about this cave – or rather, circumambulate it – seven times. Then they settle on the ground again, landing wave after wave, and seem to consult on the next step.

Now one bird from each species goes inside the cave and does not come back out. Until those birds expire inside the dark cavern, none of the others will fly away. Sometimes a bird that has entered the cave rushes back out in fear of its life. When that happens, the other birds strike it and drive it back inside. If it comes out again, they kill it with their beaks and make another one go in.

As the day declines, first the cranes take off, then the vultures, the eagles, the kites, and finally the storks. Eventually all the birds take wing and for an entire hour – with sad voices and lamenting cries that would comfort the soul of any mournful listener – they once again fly seven times around this mountain. As night falls, all God’s birds draw up in their formations and, flock by flock, fly away heading south. After crossing over the country of Funjistan and the headwaters of the Nile, they continue beyond the confines of this Egyptian peninsula (i.e., the African continent). Portuguese and Indian mariners have observed them flying southward over the ocean; but where they go after that, nobody knows.

Actually, it is only the storks that cross the ocean. The other birds do not go beyond Africa, which is their winter home. For the migrating birds of every country have a summer pasture (in the north) as well as winter quarters where the climate is tropical. But they cannot breed in the tropics, because the intense heat cooks their eggs. This humble one, when I was going to Mecca, once found two ostrich eggs. I bored holes in them, thinking that I would empty them and take them back to Turkey; but I found that they were hard-boiled from the heat of the sun.

When those birds had flown away, I climbed with a few other individuals to the top of the mountain to see the bird mummies in their cemetery. When we got to the cave, we went inside. It is not too dark, and is a huge cavern; but the stench of countless avian corpses soon drove us back out. We did notice, however, that the representatives of the various bird species that had come into the cave had latched onto holes in the domes of the cavern with their beaks and claws and were now hanging there, dead. And the bird corpses underfoot were the remains of previous ones that had hung by their claws and then fallen.

The various bird species come every year and visit this mountain in the manner I have described. Then, after sacrificing one of their number in this cave, they cross the lands of Aswan and Sudan and fly out over the ocean. In spring, when they return from their winter home in the tropics, they once again visit this marvellous mountain. They circumnavigate it seven times as previously, but do not sacrifice any of their number in the cave and do not rest there overnight, but continue on.

Only God knows the number of dead birds piled up inside this cave. It is an annual spectacle.

The people of the province know about the annual sacrifice, and it has come down from their ancestors that if no bird remains suspended by its claws but they all fall to the bottom of the cave, it is a sign of impending drought. So when that happens, they put all their grain in storage bins and guard it carefully until the drought is over. If a single dead bird remains suspended, the harvest will be slight. If there are two, the peasants will get just enough crops for subsistence. If three, there will be plenty, the blessed Nile will rise to 16 cubits, and the Sultan will be paid his tax. If there are four hanging birds, the Nile will overflow to 20 cubits and all the government agents and tax farmers will get rich. If there are five, the Nile flood will be 22 cubits and all the peasants of Egypt will get rich. If there are six, it will be 26 cubits and the crops will be so abundant – each bearing a hundred grains (2:261) – that peasants and emirs and governors and tax farmers together will be unable to remove them all from the threshing floors. This is tested wisdom and a firm belief of the fellahin of Upper Egypt, and it occurs by God’s command.

It is a strange quirk of nature that wild creatures and denizens of the air should come of their own volition, latch on to the holes in the rock at the top of this cave, and hang there by their beaks and claws until they die. It is a wondrous act of divination, an ancient talisman that is effective until today – truly white magic! God be praised that in the course of my travels I have been vouchsafed to witness this tremendous spectacle.





13. Map of the Nile





The sages of old spent the length of their lives travelling in these countries, measuring altitudes with their astrolabes and learning about God’s bounties, making maps and writing the books of Geography and Pa[d]riye and Koloniye (i.e. Ptolemy on the Old World and Christopher Columbus on the New). This humble one, full of fault, also has taken great pains to record the villages, towns, cities, mountains, rivers, and stages north and south that I have traversed in the course of my travels, in order to expound upon the countries where I have sojourned and to set down their contours in writing. I have also recorded many castles and countries, rivers, mountains and lakes, as in the Mappa Mundi, in the fashion that I have seen done by my master Nakkaş Hükmizade Ali Bey. If God permits me to complete this journey of the Nile and Funjistan, I plan to record their features (in such a map).





14. Meeting with Kör Husayn Qan





The great plain of Hankoc


It is governed by the dabir (chief accountant) of the king of Funjistan. All our soldiery encamped here, tent rope to tent rope. In the morning, a cry of Allah Allah! arose at the eastern end of the plain. It seems that Kör Husayn Qan’s army was waiting there, and when they heard that our troops had arrived with grain, in their joy they let out the cry of God is Great! The Funj castle magistrates who had accompanied us left their baggage and prepared to race forward on their riding-camels unburdened.

This humble one also took my letters and joined the forced march. After traversing this wilderness for three hours we reached a sea of men and squabbling camels. The plain was covered with black tents and ihram derim (a kind of tent), and there were countless soldiers with javelins, bows and arrows, crossbows, slings and spears.

When we had made our way through them, we came upon another troop from whose heads in the heat of the sun there wafted a sweet fragrance that perfumed our brains. They had anointed themselves with civet. A swarthy people with handsome faces, they were the forces of the king of Qirmanqa, myriads of men who had come to join forces with the Funj king and whose black tents covered the ground.

After passing through them we entered upon another troop that resembled Egyptian soldiers and even had Ottoman tents here and there. We rejoiced to see these familiar tents and baggage, and the derim tents that looked like those of bedouin Arabs.

Continuing forward, we saw about 2,000 varicoloured tents and pup-tents and tent-pavilions, and a royal pavilions with golden balls and precious gauze. The shiny balls glittered in the bright sun and dazzled our eyes. This, as it turned out, belonged to Husayn Qan.

The castle qans (magistrates) approached the pavilion, with this humble one in front, walking fearlessly but properly. Husayn Qan came as far as the pavilion door to greet us. After shaking hands, I showered him with some flattering phrases, then he took me by the hand and sat me down opposite him knee to knee.

‘Welcome!’ he said in Turkish. ‘Safa geldin, hoş geldin!’ It turned out that he spoke excellent Turkish, since he was from the Kalafish Bedouins near Aswan. We exchanged pleasantries, and I wished him well on his campaign, which pleased him mightily. He served tea and fennel. After drinking a cup of each, I begged leave to let the castle qans come forward one by one and kiss his hand.

The king of Barbari came first. He honoured him mightily and took him on his right side. Then the dabir of the Funj emperor kissed his hand. He greeted him according to their protocol and said, ‘Have your baggage brought immediately, so we can give grain to the troops. In the morning, God willing, we’ll advance against the enemy.’

He also addressed this humble one, saying, ‘We’ll take you on the gaza as well. You are most welcome here.’

I handed over the letter of the vizier (i.e., Ottoman governor) of Egypt and the letters of the Girga, Der, Ibrim and Say notables. The dabir of the Funj read out the Arabic letters with excellent articulation. When Husayn Qan understood their contents, he rose to his feet and tried to kiss my hand, but I would not let him. That very hour he ordered his deputy to felicitate me with a tent and to supply all our needs. So we camped in his circle.

He had a pastille of ambergris in his hand and gave it to me. In return, I gave him a lime-coloured gold-embroidered Kaya Sultan handkerchief that I had in my bosom. He immediately used it to tie together the locks of his hair, letting it hang down like a Muhammadan turban-end.

‘This will bring us luck, God willing,’ he said. ‘We have got a gift from the Turks, so we will get much booty and will be victorious.’

I arose and went to his tents where I rested for an hour while his soldiers and our servants came and set up our tents. At the time of the mid-afternoon prayer, Hüseyn Bey (i.e., Husayn Qan) came to our tent and raised us from the ground (i.e., treated us with great honour). I brought out some tidbits and candies that I happened to have. He drank a cup of sherbet flavoured with musk and took great pleasure. When he was about to leave, I presented him with a skein of mohair, two pieces of Damietta striped stuff and two jars of sorrel sherbet flavoured with musk, which pleased him exceedingly. He returned to his pavilion and distributed the newly-arrived grain supplies to his troops.

At the time of the sunset prayer, an enormous clamour arose from among the countless soldiery, causing my heart to leap. It turned out to be the call to prayer! At midnight they sounded the kettledrums, took down the tents, and got ready to march. At the time of the morning prayer, the trumpets and drums and kettledrums sounded and the march began.

Now Husayn Qan summoned this humble one and offered to take me up on his Mahmudi elephant, where he was already mounted.

‘By God,’ said I, ‘this is the first time I have ridden an elephant.’ He let down a ladder woven of elephant skin. Reciting the Mu‘avvizeteyn I clambered up to the kiosk on the back of the elephant, settled in knee to knee with Husayn Qan, and we set out. The king of Barbari was also with us, as was the dabir of Funjistan – indeed, he had invited thirteen men to join him on the elephant’s back, and we sat there clustered together, eating our breakfast and cutting stages (i.e., travelling fast). But this elephant moved in such stately fashion that the tea and fennel in our cups did not spill one drop, although a thousand elephants and even horses could not keep up with him.

After breakfast, other elephants came abreast with ours. They had mounted on them the firdilans – i.e., the singers and musicians. They played a kind of square rebab (rebec), and another instrument consisting of 200 iron rings attached to a hoop and making the sound kıvış kıvış, also reed instruments (?) accompanying the songs sung in a fine and melancholy voice by the Funji singer. So we rolled up stations (i.e., travelled apace) enjoying these ‘Bayqara’ musical sessions.





15. Meeting with Qan Girgis; encounter with two Bektashi dervishes





Description of the great and ancient fortress of Arbaji


It is a lovely city on the east bank of the Nile, built in the middle of a vast and fruitful plain. The fortification is made of lofty trees trunks, joined together with wooden planks and mud bricks morticed with millet stalks and sedge. In this country there are trees used in building construction that are 2,000 or 3,000 years old and have never decayed – trees such as the wild date-palm, acacia, tamarisk, teak, oleander, and ilex.

The fortress is rectangular in shape, 1,000 paces in circumference. Inside are 700 houses made of reeds and mud bricks – there is no sign of stone in this. The door leaves are made of wild date-palm wood. Outside the fortress are 3,000 reed and mud brick houses, seven Friday mosques, and eleven boza shops. There are no other amenities – no minaret, han, public bath, water dispensary, or medrese – and no orchards or flower gardens, though there are many vegetable gardens.

This city was originally the residence of the Funj king’s vizier, Qan Pir, and is now the residence of the king’s brother, Qan Girgis. He is in command of 40,000 troops and 600,000 Barbari peasants.

Qan Girgis is a good-natured individual, and I was honoured with the pleasure of his company. I handed over some of the booty that Kör Hüseyn Bey had got from the Firdaniya gaza, plus the gifts of the kadi of the Barbari king, saying, ‘Husayn Qan sends his greetings.’

He inquired about the gaza, and when they related how it came out, he performed a prostration of thanksgiving. He was also very pleased with the gifts of the Barbari king. At this juncture, I presented him with one jar of sorrel sherbet flavoured with musk, one handkerchief, and one shirt with a pair of breeches, which pleased him exceedingly.

This Qan Girgis was, however, a rather simple-minded person. When he first caught sight of me and my retinue he got up and hid in a corner, shouting to his interpreter, ‘Who are these raw men?’

‘They are from the vizier of Egypt and are going to your brother, the Sultan of Funj,’ he replied.

‘Why then are they so white and raw?’ he asked. ‘Why aren’t they qaqan (i.e., cooked?) like us?’

The interpreter turned to me and said, ‘Qan Girgis wishes to know why these men are so white? Have they come to complain about someone having flayed the skin off their faces? If they are seeking justice against someone who has made them so white and raw, he will certainly give them justice and punish the offender.’

I was somewhat taken aback at this absurd speech, and I began to bemoan my state, thinking that I had travelled through eighteen empires and kingdoms only to end up in this country and to hear such foolishness. But then I considered that I had come here of my own free will, so I praised God and began to answer the interpreter thus, ‘We are servants of the Sultan of Mecca and Medina, king of the Arabs and Persians and Turks, and Caesar of Constantinople, Sultan Mehmed Khan. We reside on the soil of his jurisdiction. By command of God most High, and in accordance with divine custom (i.e., natural law), all the people of that region are white like us. In your country of Funjistan, in Barbari and Sudan and Baghanisqa – in short, everywhere in the Egyptian peninsula (i.e., the African continent) – the people are descended from Ham son of Noah, and like you their faces are black and their eyes are black and even there words are black. God, Lord of the Worlds, created you black and created us white. Otherwise, no one flayed the skin of our faces; had they done so, our faces would be bleeding. And we have not come to complain and seek justice. The one who makes our faces white (i.e., proves our innocence) in this world and the next is God – and who can demand justice of God?’

In this preacher-like fashion I made my reply, and the interpreter conveyed it point by point to Qan Girgis the Silly. In his amazement he kept crying İllalla illalla! and, addressing his crow-like cronies, said, ‘Have you ever seen uncooked men like these?’

Among those present was a Barbari man who had travelled as far as Cairo and Gaza. He replied, ‘May God increase your life, O Qan Girgis! I have seen such uncooked men in Egypt. In that country the sun does not blaze so hot as it does here, and that is why the people there stay so raw.’

At this I nearly went out of my mind, thinking that now this madman was going to strip us naked and grill us in the sun for a few days so that we get cooked. ‘My lord, I take refuge in You,’ I muttered, and continually recited the Mu‘avvizeteyn and repeatedly called on God the Preserver.

God be praised, he did not do anything of that sort. But he did get up from his place and come toward me. I just stood there, without flinching, though my eye was on my servants and theirs was on their weapons. He approached with his cronies and said, ‘Let’s see what sort of clothing they wear. Let’s see if the rest of their bodies are a raw as their faces.’

He tried to get me to loosen my waistband, and was very insistent about it. All sorts of fearful fancies started going through my mind. I pulled up the sleeves of my robe as far as the elbows and showed him my arms, but he was not satisfied.

‘You must loosen your waistband,’ he said. ‘Let us see your clothes and your body.’

I began to get angry at such an unreasonable proposal. But I was also still afraid that he was going to strip us and cook us in the sun, and I began to cry for help. With us were some Ethiopian Jabarti men (Ethiopian Muslims) from Dongola, who now intervened.

‘O Qan Girgis,’ they said. ‘These are Turks. They have never seen such behaviour or heard such proposals. They think you will loosen their waistbands, take their clothing, leave them naked, and steal their money and goods. You see that their servants are fully armed, with three or four muskets apiece. It looks as though there will be a tussle and we’ll end up like the sword bazaar in Arbaji. Then how will you answer your brother Malik Qaqan?’

He returned to his seat and, with a smile, called me over. I tried to beg off, but he begged and wheedled, so I went and settled next to him knee to knee. He said lots of things, and also apologised.

‘In my entire life,’ he said, ‘I have never seen such raw men in this country as you are. That is why I requested to see your skin. Otherwise, God forbid, we had no designs on your person.’

He stood up and once again tried to kiss my hand.

‘At least undo your turban so we can see your head,’ he said.

I realised that this man had a screw loose, and it is crazy to consort with someone who is crazy. So I said, ‘The reason we have such long turbans is that we are those who struggle in God’s path (or, those who engage in jihad). When we are martyred, we will be wrapped and buried in our turbans. It is a token of the Prophet and signifies Muhammadan honour and dignity. To undo a man’s turban from his head is to undo his honour. It is now such a sign on our heads.’

This was how I answered him, and I did not undo my turban.

He took out six pastilles of white ambergris from behind his leathern cushion and gave them to me. He also gave me a bag of aloes wood, two bags of carnelians, and large seeds of coral the size of nutmegs. And he gave me two black virgin maidens and eight swarthy boys. In return, and to lighten my load, I gave him an elephant. He was delighted with this exchange, but I was even more delighted, since these elephants consumed 100 camel loads of grass per day and drank half the Nile.

On the third day we bade each other farewell and our party, along with his donation of soldiery, headed toward Funjistan along the shore of the Nile. That day we went for twelve hours.





Description of the fortress of Itshan


A round fortress of mud brick on the west bank of the Nile, with one Friday mosque and 600 houses of mud brick and thatch.

By God’s wisdom, its governor was Rumlu Kara Ali Çelebi, an elegant and eloquent gentleman (çelebi) who had been born of an Ethiopian slavegirl in Tophane (in Istanbul). In his youth, while journeying from Ethiopia to Zayla (in Yemen), he had fallen captive to these Funj and for these fifty years was unable to free himself. He had wife and children, and was a good-natured and sweet-spoken ‘mad lover’ (i.e., one inclined to poetry and mysticism).

We toured the mosque and the weekly market places of the town, enjoyed the singers and musicians in the boza shops, then proceeded to the gardens outside the town where we indulged in melons and watermelons.





A melancholy incident


This humble one, the world traveller and boon-companion of mankind, Evliya-i Gülşeni, having traversed the globe and viewed its cities and countries, had now set foot in Itshan, one of the cities of Sudan in the country of the blacks; and after diligently touring the town, and studiously visiting its streets and markets, I was now enjoying the melon season in its gardens, while my slaveboys Kazım and Sührab stood nearby surveying all four directions – for I never went a single moment without a guard and a sentry, since that is what they advised me in Ibrim and Say.

‘Agha,’ they said, ‘two men have appeared. They are approaching, mounted on I don’t know what.’

‘Keep your weapons at hand,’ I told them, and busied myself eating watermelon.

They arrived. Both were white men, but I had never seen the likes of their mounts. As I pondered what animals they could be, I heard the resounding noise of a Bektashi trumpet.

I stood up to observe these individuals. Two lovers of God appeared, graceful and lively, Bektashi dervishes in their Kalender outfits. As they came near, they sounded some reverberating salutes with their trumpets, in the mu‘aşşer (?) musical mode. After greetings, they dismounted and we kissed and embraced. Then they sat down, holding the reins of their beasts in their hands.

‘Boys,’ I said to my servants, ‘take these lovers’ animals from their hands and let them graze.’

‘No,’ said the Bektashis, ‘these animals will not go near any man who eats meat, nor can such men go near them.’

I was dumbfounded. Taking a closer look at these beasts, I saw that one was a rhinoceros. […] (described at length). The other was an oryx (kazık boynuz, lit. stake horn), known in Arabic as baghal barri (a wild mule). It is indeed very much like a mule, except that it has two thin black nodose horns just below its ears, the tips of which are like lancets, and cloven hoofs. Its flesh can be eaten, according to the four Sunni rites. It is very swift, like a gazelle, and the female gives birth once every two years – a marvellous creature indeed! These lovers had tamed these beasts, attached reins and put saddles on their backs, and rode them.

Having examined these creatures, I sat with the Bektashis in the garden and had much lively discourse with them. At dinner time, we offered what we had – since The best food is what is readily at hand – consisting of camel meat and chicken. But they refused, saying they had not tasted meat for seven years, and began to weep.

When we inquired the reason, they related as follows, ‘We were three brothers travelling with India-merchant ships from India to Ethiopia. Portuguese infidels seized our ships and took all three of us captive. They imprisoned us in their hold. By God’s wisdom, one of our brothers died, and they roasted his body and forced us to eat it. We fed on our brother’s flesh for an entire month. At the end of a month, by God’s wisdom, as we were sailing in the Indian Ocean, a storm hurled us ashore and our ship broke apart. We fled to a mountain top where we bathed in a stream and performed two prostrations of thanksgiving. And we swore never to eat the flesh of any living thing. That is the reason.’

They wept as they told us this, then continued, ‘The next day, these two animals came and associated with us. Though dumb creatures, they conveyed a thousand sentiments. It is now seven years that we have been wandering with these animals, and we have not yet reached a place of safety. We are left amidst negro blacks who treat us with contempt, saying that we are raw men.’

They complained bitterly, but gave thanks to God and ate a little barley bread and millet bread and some melons and watermelons. It turned out that they had been grazing with their animals for the past seven months, subsisting on grass. Sometimes when they went into cities, people were abusive and refused to give them food.

‘Of what garden are you the roses?’ I boldly inquired. ‘Of what country’s pure earth do you derive, and of what river’s water have you drunk? What is your birthplace?’

‘We are from Larende near Konya in the land of Turkey,’ they replied.

‘I have seen your home town,’ I said. ‘I have visited the tomb of the mother of Mawlana (Jalaladdin Rumi) in her mosque, and have toured the noteworthy medreses of Karamanoğlu Ya‘kub and Ibrahim Bey.’ They were pleased at this response.

‘O faithful brethren,’ I continued, ‘if you wish to reach a place of safety, do not depart a single step from this humble one, but accept our fellowship and, by God’s command, I will bring you to the country of Egypt in honour and security.’

We joined hands, made vows, and exchanged pieces of bread. The three of us became brothers in this world and the next, and we had many fine conversations together. It warmed my heart to see Turkish dervishes in such inhospitable coasts as these.

Leaving the garden, we made our way back to our quarters in Itshan castle where I indicated a place for these Bektashis among our companions. In the course of our conversations I learned that their names were Seyyid Ni‘metullah and Seyyid Carullah. I also offered them each a suit of clothing that I had on hand, but they refused, saying they would not depart from their dervish habit, nor would they sully themselves with this world’s refuse. I saw that they were pure souls who nested like the phoenix on the Qaf of contentment. And I gave thanks to God, mindful of the proverb, First the companion, then the road.





16. Elephants and monkeys





From there (Wadi Qoz) the next day, as we were travelling in the desert heading north, a black dust-cloud appeared in the sky ahead of us. Wondering what it could be, we continued forward. It turned out that an eagle had seized a baby elephant and, while starting to eat it, the mother elephant had come and was battling with the eagle. That was the reason for the cloud of dust hanging in the air. We observed from a distance, without making a sound. The big elephant tried to protect the little one with her trunk, but it was no use; she was overcome by the terrible eagle and seriously wounded.

Now our companions took pity. Crying Allah Allah! with a single voice, and shooting their muskets, they spurred on their horses and made the eagle take flight. It was like a black cloud, its wing-spread casting a shadow on the ground that blocked the sun light. The mother elephant seized the opportunity and ran away. We approached the baby elephant. The terrible eagle had gouged out its eyes and gnawed at several parts of its body. It staggered about in that plain, fearing for its life.

We resumed our journey. When we had moved off some distance, the eagle swooped down from the sky, took the baby elephant in its beak, flew up into the air and dropped it on the ground, where it broke into pieces. The eagle settled over it and began to feed. We passed by that place,

[…]

Departing from Poragha the following morning, we proceeded through an uninhabited valley. Eleven huge Mahmudi elephants accompanied us, five of them milk-white, six of them black. They paid us little heed, sometimes walking in front of us, sometimes to our right or left, chasing one another, or playing, or fighting. This went on for seven hours. Though we were armed, we agreed not to shoot at them, but simply to watch.

One of them was a very large old elephant. He did not prance around like the others, but several times came close to the soldiers in order, as it seemed, to exhibit his beauty. He was a very clever animal. His legs were like minarets, tusks like ship-masts, trunk like a chimney, belly like an Isfahan kettledrum, hide like a worn carpet, mouth like the mouth of a stokehold, eyes like gazelle eyes, tail like the staff of a dervish sheikh, anus like the Cave of Orphans.

These eleven elephants accompanied us all the way to the next stage, and no one laid a hand on them.

[…]

Departing from there (Nazdi) in the morning, we again headed north, encountering herds of elephant and rhinoceros, deer, gazelle, wild mule and oryx – so many animals that only God knows their number. And – glory to God! – this was a plain completely covered with trees and other vegetation. Birds in every corner cheered our spirits with their plaintive song. Actually, this bird jungle is quite well-known in the province of Dombiya, under the name of Wadisha. Once a year the king of Dombiya comes here to hunt – here and there one can see benches for his tents and cooking places. We stayed in this jungle plain for three days, camping and hiking, and saw many wonderful things.

There are monkeys here as big as Merzifon donkeys. They use one another as mounts, and sometimes use goats. They are different colours – white, pied, red, black, gray, and blue – and only the Creator knows their number. Some carry clubs on their shoulders, as though they were doorkeepers or going somewhere urgently on official business. Some are huge lumbering creatures that make the earth tremble when they run. In short, there are many kinds of monkey, one more comical than the next. This humble one found three infant monkeys on the road, which we put on the pack-horses and fed.

In this plain we reached the border of the Sultan of Dombiya and crossed into Ethiopia in the first clime. We made a thanksgiving sacrifice for getting this far in safety. The next day, however, the effect of the first clime began to make itself felt, and our heads were cooked from the heat of the sun; but by God’s command, it did us no harm.

We always had ten men go in front as a vanguard, and at this stage, while we watched, the man at the front slid off his horse and the horse ran back toward us. The other nine men fell on their horses’ necks and came to us panting heavily.

‘What’s going on?’ we asked.

‘By God, there’s a scoop-tail (kepçe kuyruk – i.e., horned viper?). It sprinkled its urine on that unfortunate fellow, who was riding in front of us. He fell off his horse and the horse ran to you.’

As they reported this, the horse also fell to the ground and gave up the ghost. It immediately swelled up, like a mountain. Everyone fled from its side, and the horse burst like a cannon.

‘What should we do now? Can we take a different road?’

With such a hue and cry, and shooting our muskets, we plucked up our courage and went forward. That damned creature known as scoop-tail – it is somewhat like a gazelle in size and appearance, but its tail hangs down raggedly – scurried away into the mountains. We approached the poor fellow who suffered the attack. His body had turned into a coagulated mass.

‘Don’t go near him,’ they cried. ‘Don’t even look at him. The stench of the poison will affect you badly.’

We left him there and resumed our journey. Some of his companions sighed in regret, since the dead man had 700 gold pieces in his belt. But what could they do? The fellow’s corpse had turned to pudding

[…]

The next day we continued north. The Sea of Suez (Red Sea) appeared before us. From now on we went east along the shore, skirting black mountains (on our right), and cut stages for six days, until we entered the land of monkeys (Vilayet-i Maymunistan). Everywhere, both mountain and plain, was taken over by monkeys, baboons, chimpanzees, etc. They all engaged in some comical behaviour, viewing us from the trees, chattering ah ah or kah kah or vah vah, doing somersaults and tumbling and performing all sorts of acrobatics. Watching them made us forget the hardship of the journey. In short, the Creator of the world has not created any creature as funny and clever as the monkey. But they are ill-omened (although maymun means well-omened!). Watching them dispels grief, to be sure; but feeding them betokens that one will inherit poverty. It is great fun to watch them, however. The elephant is also a clever animal.





17. Envoi





Final Word and Farewell to the Reader


As they say in the Hindi language, Izid Alla kipanah chalti hun (‘I desire the refuge of God’). Praises without end to the Lord Creator, by whose assistance these scattered folios of ours, having turned many colours like dervish robes, are now completed in Cairo, the rare one of the age. The writing of it, the beginning and end of it, was in the year (—) when the governor of Egypt was (—) Pasha, may God vouchsafe him what he desires. But in the eyes of the intelligent it is not complete. I only hope that they will attribute its shortcomings to the length of my travels, and will disregard the lack of fancy phrases and fine expressions; that they will cover its faults with the skirt of forgiveness, and will scratch out its errors with the pen-sharpener of improvement.

For it is fifty-one years now that this humble one, full of fault, having sojourned in the seven climes, has brought these rough copies to completion. After so many travels I have now withdrawn into obscurity. It is not vouchsafed to me to study chronicles and histories, nor have I recorded in this my Book of Travels any other traveller’s adventures or any other writer’s compositions. Only I have, where appropriate, added Koran commentaries and prophetic Hadiths that I learned from my master Sheikh Ali al-Shumurlisi, with his permission.

Aside from that, these rough copies are all the record of my own adventures and of my travels which I have taken pains to record in such shameless detail. Apologies are acceptable among the noble – may my apology be acceptable, may I be remembered with a benediction.

THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
A Medieval Journey
from Cordoba to Jerusalem

Preface
THE undertaking of this work was prompted by Mr. Arthur
Hibbert, Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, whose
interests, ranging far beyond the confines of his field of mediaeval
studies, first led me to the study of Ibn Jubayr, and whose
enthusiasm encouraged me to attempt this translation. But this
is only one of my many debts to that College and to its Provost,
Sir John Sheppard, without whose broad and enlightened sympathies
I should never have shared of its privileges. I am
honoured that he and the Fellows should condescend to accept
the dedication of this book.
To Professor A. J. Arberry, the Sir Thomas Adams's Professor
of Arabic at the University of Cambridge, I owe the
deepest gratitude, not only for teaching me most of what I
know of Oriental scholarship, but for guidance and help in
this particular work. In the midst of his monumental labours
he was always ready, indeed eager, to give me of his massive
erudition. I must also record my indebtedness to Professor
A. W. Lawrence of Cambridge University and Professor
H. A. R. Gibb of Oxford University for valuable advice and.
encouragement, and my thanks to Mr. A. J. Scholfield, Mr.
J. Pearson, and Mr. S. Naish of the Cambridge University
Library, to Mr. S. C. Sutton of the India Office Library, and
to Dr. J. Leveen of the British Museum, for the liberal library
facilities and personal help they gave me. Mr. A. S. Nashar
of Alexandria University allowed me to draw on his ever
surprising familiarity with the literature and history of the
Arabs, and Mr. Muhammad Salim of Nablus, Palestine, and
Mr. Robert Serjeant of London University mumined many
obscurities. Mr. Steven Runciman brought his learning to a
reading of my notes on Crusader Syria and saved me from
serious error. To my wife I owe the undisturbed ease and
abstraction I needed for my task. And I would be failing in
8 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
gratitude if I did not attest my obligation to my publisher,
Mr. Jonathan Cape, whose interest in things Arabian, extending
from the works of Doughty and Lawrence to that of King
Abdulla, has now embraced my humbler contribution.
As for the Arabs themselves, who have given me the keenest
pleasures and interests of my life, I can only hope that I have
helped to unveil some portion of their long and fabulous
history.

Introduction
ONE day in the year A.D. 1182, the Moorish Governor of
Granada, then the wealthiest and most splendid city of
Spain, summoned his secretary to discharge some business.
The incumbent of this post was Abu '1-Husayn Muhammad
ibn Ahmad ibn Jubayr, who, born in 1145 to a good family
in Valencia,* had by his learning and character attained this
office of trust. On arrival before his master, he had been
offered a cup of wine, but the continent clerk, a sincere Muslim
who emulated the temperance of his prophet, had pleaded that
never before had his lips touched strong drink. The unregenerate
prince, wishful of repairing this strange neglect, and
with tones and gestures that allowed of no dispute, had thereupon
cried: 'Seven cups, by Allah, shalt thou drink'; and the
trembling scholar, his apprehensions of the wrath to come
obscured by present terrors, had been fain to swallow the forbidden
draughts. Yet no sooner had he done so than the prince
was seized with sudden pity, and in remorse had seven times
filled the cup with golden dinars and poured them into the
bosom of his servant's gown.
The good man, who long had cherished the wish to discharge
the duty of the pilgrimage to Mecca, at once determined
to expiate his godless act by devoting the money to this end.
So, seeking and obtaining his master's leave, he took up the
pilgrim staff and, on the 3rd of February, 1183, accompanied
by Abu Ja'far Ahmad ibn Hassan, a physician of Granada,
* He was descended from 'Abd al-Salam ibn Jubayr who, coming from the
tribe of Kinanah near Mecca, had entered Spain with the army sent in A.D. 740
by the Caliph of Damascus under the general Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri to quell
the Berber insurrection in his Spanish provinces. At the time of our diarist, the
Berber dynasty of die Almohades had established diemselves as the independent
rulers of Muslim Spain, and it was one of their princes, Abu Sa'id 'Uthman ibn
'Abd al-Mu'min, who was his master and the Governor of Granada.
16 THE TRAVELS OF LBN JUBAYR
departed on his way. And in this chronicle, which he recorded
daily, or at least frequently and while his impressions were still
fresh, we may read of the strange events and places, and the
notable people and customs, that he observed upon the mediaeval
eastern scene before, on the 25th of April, 1185, he
returned to his native Spain.
Embarking on a Genoese ship, he came to Egypt where,
recounting his impressions of the ancient wonders that are but
now unfolding their meaning, he pondered the splendid edifices
and the salutary reforms prescribed by the munificence
and the piety of Saladin, the rising champion of the East. He
ascended the Nile, and describes the great temples of the
Pharaohs now in ruin, at which 'the beholder might conceive
that all time spent on their adornment would be too short'.
From the Nile he journeyed in a camel caravan to the Red
Sea, there to embark in a fragile craft for the Hejaz and, being
delivered from the perils both of the waterless desert and a
reef-set sea, arrive at the Holy Cities of Arabia. With precise
and reverent detail he describes the Great Mosque of Mecca
and its holy of holies, the Ka'bah, and then unfolds the
unchanging pilgrim rites that, then and to-day, Muslims from
all quarters of the earth must seek, if they have the means, at
least once in a life-time to discharge.
The pilgrim then moved north to visit the tomb of the
prophet Muhammad in Medina, which done, he turned eastward
and, joining the long and motley caravan of pilgrims
returning to Iraq and Turkestan, the sister of the caravan from
Damascus described to us in the deathless pages of Doughty,
he portrays its slow and ordered march across the deserts of
Arabia to Baghdad, the City of the Caliphs, where lingered
still the glories of Harun al-Rashid. He sees the reigning caliph,
Nasir, 'the lustre of whose reign consists only in pages and
negro eunuchs' and who, seeking to throw off the yoke of
the fierce and illiberal Turk, once mercenaries and now masters,
most foolishly invoked the aid of Jengis Khan; for the heathen
hordes of Tartary, riding fleet horses and drawing strange bows,
INTRODUCTION *7
were soon to extinguish his dynasty, massacre the citizens, and,
breaking the splendid irrigatory canals our traveller admires,
reduce a fruitful countryside to a horrid waste.
The armed company of some Turkish princesses gave him
protection for his passage along the Euphrates and through such
ancient cities as Mosul and Nineveh until, coming to northern
Syria, he descended through Aleppo to Damascus. This jewel
of the East he depicts as it was a hundred years before the
invasion of the Mongols, and the Great or Umayyad Mosque
that is still to-day one of its glories he describes as it was before
the pillage of Timurlane.
Weary now for home, our pilgrim set forth for Acre in the
Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem that he might there take ship
to Spain. And here we come upon the strange anomaly of those
days. At a time when the kingdom is at war with the Muslims
and when our diarist has even witnessed, as he left Damascus,
the triumphant return of the army of Saladin, laden with booty
and leading many Christian prisoners, he yet can journey to
this Christian stronghold in a caravan of Muslim merchants.
This Latin kingdom, founded some eighty years before by
the warriors of the First Crusade, had endured only because it
was united amidst the discord and dissension of the Saracens.
To the north, the contending Arab princes and Seljuk dynasts,
being orthodox Sunni Muslims, acknowledged as Commander
of the Faithful the elected Caliph of Baghdad. But to the south,
Egypt and its large provinces was ruled by the Fatimids, who
as Shi'ites believed the caliphate to be a God-given office
inherent in their family as descendants of 'Ali, the husband of
the prophet Muhammad's daughter Fatimah, from whom they
took their name.
It was the role and achievement of Saladin to unite Islam.
As lieutenant of the Seljuk prince Nur al-Din ibn Zengi, who
had combined the Muslim states of Syria, he had gone south
and removed the heretic caliph of Egypt. On the death of Nur
al-Din he had taken his suzerain's possessions; and from the
Caliph of Baghdad he had condescended to ask, and the puppet
B
18 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Caliph had been flattered to grant, a patent of rule for Egypt
and Syria and their dependent provinces. The eastern Muslim
world was now one; the Frankish kingdom was enveloped,
and its death-knell had sounded.
If the opponents of the Cross were at last united, all within
the Christian realm was anarchy and alarm. King Baldwin IV
was a dying leper, and as with the Greek princes before Troy,
there was treachery and strife among the chiefs. Into their midst
the pilgrim was allowed to ride without let or hap; and from
the critical viewpoint of a scholarly Muslim we may observe
afresh the customs and manners of the champions of the
Cross.
At Acre he embarked with fifty other Muslims on a Genoese
ship sailing west with two thousand Christian pilgrims from
Jerusalem, and after much tribulation and peril on the sea was
shipwrecked upon the shores of Sicily. And here he must have
perished but for the timely arrival of the island's ruler, King
William II, fourth of a line of brilliant pirates, the famous house
of Hauteville which, driven by the old Norse wanderlust from
their father's petty seigneury in Normandy, had won a kingdom
under a blue sky.
From the Arabs they had taken Sicily, and the author records
with pride the persisting art of the Arab craftsmen and husbandmen.
High officers of the court, highly favoured ladies,
and privileged eunuchs discovered to him their secret cleaving
to the faith of Islam; and he studied the court, cities, and customs
of this fabulous kingdom, where, without laying aside
their dauntless valour and virile energy, the Normans, with
their quick brilliance, love of magnificence, and receptive genius
for acquiring what was polished and polite of the civilisations
their long lances had subdued, took all, and more than all, the
Eastern refinements that they found and brought to a full
fruition a glorious blend of Arab-Norman art and culture.

part Greek, part English, his army composed as to half of
Moors, his fleet officered by Greeks, himself a Latin Christian,
but, in that balmy climate of the south, ruling in half-Byzantine,
half-oriental state, with a harem and eunuchs.'* At Sicily our
traveller took ship for home, whither he came without further
mishap, and with a heart full of gratitude for the beneficence
of Almighty God.
Throughout his journey indeed, he walked with God, and
his constant supplications to his Maker when in distress and
danger, and his just and ready praise and thanks for His mercies
and blessings, keep us ever mindful that he is a man of piety in
a community that is above all a religious community. For to
its faith, Islam (Arabic, 'Submission' to the •will of God), it
owed its beginning and existence, its laws, social system, and
code of values; and to Islam it owed its common language,
Arabic, the language of the Koran. In this, the sacred scripture
of Islam, communicated as Muslims believe by the Creator to
His prophet Muhammad, the power, unity, and goodness of
God are pronounced. Five duties are laid on all believers: (i) the
profession of faith, 'There is no God but God'; (ii) the performance
of divine worship five times a day; (iii) the fast
between sunset and sunrise throughout the month of Ramadan;
(iv) the payment of legal alms; and (v) the pilgrimage to
Mecca, birthplace of Muhammad and the holy city of Islam.
And all these duties we watch our pilgrim discharge.
To all his story, with its abundance of detail and interest, he
brings a perspicacity and soundness of judgement, a precision
and vividness of descriptive power (as in his picture of mediaeval
sea-travel and the terrors of shipwreck), that may, perhaps,
be expected in a scholar and writer of his repute; but in
his balanced comments on Crusader Syria and Norman Sicily,
despite the perfunctory malisons that by convention he must
pronounce upon the Christian enemy, I can discern a moderation
most rare in that fanatic age. And his portraits of these
Christian outposts, otherwise mostly known to us from strongly
* H. A. L. Fisher, A History of Europe, p. 190.
20 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
biased Western and clerical sources, are for this reason most
revealing and instructive.
We may further judge his merit and integrity by the comments
of the historian Lisan al-Din ibn al-Khatib (A.D. 1313-74),
who, in his Kitab al-Ihatahfi akhbar Ghranata ['Story of Granada']
describes him as a man 'clear in doctrine, and an illustrious
poet distinguished above all others, sound in reason, generousspirited,
and of noble character and exemplary conduct. He
was a man of remarkable goodness, and his piety confirms the
truth of his w o r k s . . . . His correspondence with contemporary
scholars reveals his merits and excellence, his superiority in
poetry, his originality in rhymed prose, and his ease and elegance
in free prose. His reputation was immense, his good deeds
many, and his fame widespread; and the incomparable story
of his journey is everywhere related. God's mercy upon him.'
The high literary reputation that Ibn Jubayr achieved among
the Arabs was partly due to his poetical works, two of the best
of those preserved being one composed on his first approach to
Medina, and another addressed to Saladin concerning the vexatious
imposts levied on pilgrims to Mecca on landing in Egypt,
but in the main it was based on this chronicle which he published
soon after his return to Spain.
The style of this chronicle, as indicated by Lisan al-Din, is,
for the most, of an easy and elegant free prose to which the
Arabic tongue so happily lends itself. For the benefit of scholars,
historians, and students of Arabic it has been my purpose to
give as literal a translation as possible, abiding faithfully by the
words, arrangement, and even imagery.of the author. But it is
beyond the resources of our tongue to reproduce the enchanting
rhythm of the frequent pieces of rhymed prose, the play
upon words, assonances, and paronomasia of the Arabic, and
here the translator must fail his author and, to his keen regret,
his readers.
The text I have used is that edited by W. Wright in 1852
and revised by M. J. de Goeje in 1907, from a manuscript preserved
in the University of Leyden. The emendations of these
INTRODUCTION 21
scholars, and their fillings of lacunae in the text by relevant
extracts and quotations from other Arab authors, I have accepted
almost in toto but have not indicated in my notes, since they
are not wanted by the general reader and to scholars are accessible
in Wright's edition, where also will be found, in the
Preface, details concerning the MS. and the method by which
it was edited. By a happy chance, a reprint of this edition, for
some time unobtainable, has just been published by the Gibb
Memorial Trust, and it is my hope that not only will the
advanced student of Arabic find the study of my rendering
a profitable and rewarding exercise, but that the beginner will
be spurred by it to still greater efforts to read the author in
his native tongue.
The excellent, so far as I can judge, Italian translation by
Schiaparelli has saved me much drudgery of research for geographical,
chronological, and other equivalents, and his notes,
which I everywhere acknowledge, I have found most useful.
And if, when checking with it those fioward passages that had
caused me much turning of lexicons, I sometimes found him
nodding, I also often found therein a pleasant confirmation
and, I gratefully confess, at times a guiding beam. This tribute
I cannot extend to the Frenchman M. Amari's work (Journal
asiatique, 1845-6), where, dealing only with the Sicilian journey,
he yet is all too often errant. The few sentences translated by
Burton for relevant passages in his Pilgrimage to al-Madinah and
Meccah I found to be uniformly inexact.
The notes, I fear, are copious and sometimes long, and this
is due to the need for providing both such annotations of a
technical character that scholars will require and those directed
to the polite layman; for it is my hope that this work, apart
from academic value, will be some contribution towards the
quickening and development of the already growing interest
and sympathy of my countrymen in the resurgent Arab and
Islamic world.
In transliteration I have followed the orthodox system,
save that printers' difficulties have dictated the dropping of
22 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
diacritical points and macrons, and that with some well-known
names I have adopted a latitudinarian practice. My short explanatory
or corrective comments in the body of the text
are placed between rectangular brackets. Parenthesis signs are
used to denote those words which, although not specifically
mentioned by the author, are nevertheless needed to complete
the meaning, or to secure the balance or euphony that otherwise
would be wanting in an English sentence. Where there
are lacunae in the text, and the missing words have not been
supplied from other Arab writers, a row of asterisks implies
the omission. Dashes are employed to isolate the many
pious ejaculations which might tire some readers, but whose
exclusion would not only destroy my aim of faithfully rendering
each word the traveller has recorded, but would also, to
my thinking, rob the book of some of its special ethos. A glossary
explains the Arabic or technical words that, in the translation,
are usually indicated in italics.
Nothing now remains but to make an end and come to my
account with all my imperfections on my head. For I cannot
but be sensible that, despite my pains and labour, since industry
must supply the want of parts, my work is full of infelicities
and shortcomings. To try to render with exactness the spirit,
style, and import of this Moor, and yet retain the freshness of
original composition, has stretched me to the full. And if I
cannot dissemble my satisfaction at ending my task, neither can
I conceal my sadness in parting from a gentle companion with
whom, from the rustic seclusion of an Irish study, I have
travelled again under Eastern skies and listened once more to
the voices of Arabs in prayer and disputation.
And so I stand aside and, begging you piece out our imperfections
with your thoughts, commend him to your hearing.
Ibn Jubayr, the passionate pilgrim
To the world when it was half a thousand years younger, the outlines of
all things seemed more clearly marked than to us.   e contrast between
su  ering and joy, between adversity and happiness, appeared more
striking. All experience had yet to the minds of men the directness and
absoluteness of the pleasure and pain of child life.
– Jan Huizinga,   e Waning of the Middle Ages
In the last decades of the twelfth century, that ‘dolphin-torn, that
gong-tormented sea’, the Mediterranean and its hinterland was
one vast war zone. In the east Saladin, the Kurdish Sultan of Egypt
and Damascus had taken Aleppo from its Zengid princeling,  Imad
al-Din, in

and a second attempt in      both failed.   ough Saladin was always
careful to acknowledge the suzerainty of al-Nasir, the  Abbasid Caliph
in Baghdad, Muslims in the east now preferred to look to Saladin as
leader of jihad against the Frankish presence in Syria. About a year
later Saladin and his nephew, Taqi al-Din, seem to have plotted to
attack the Almohad Caliphate in North Africa, though nothing came
of this.
And there was turbulence also in Constantinople.   e child
Alexius II had acceded to the imperial throne in     , but in      his
cousin, the bold and dashing Andronicus Comnenus, deposed him.
Andronicus was known to be hostile to the former emperor Manuel I’s
policy of favouring both the Crusader states and the Italian merchant
republics and, even before Andronicus had arrived in Constantinople,
a massacre of the Italians and other Westerners in the city had taken
place.   ereupon the Norman king, William II, began preparations
for a revenge attack on the Byzantine Empire.   e landing of the
Sicilian army in Epirus in August      would precipitate the downfall
of Andronicus, who was tortured and torn to pieces by his former
subjects.
In the west, Abu Ya’qub Yusuf (r.    
–  ), the Almohad caliph
and ruler of Morocco and southern Spain, led an army of jihad out
from Seville and advanced against the Portuguese in Santarem and
came close to capturing it in early assaults before withdrawing. A few
days later he was dead, and it was left to his son and successor, Ya’qub
al-Mansur (r.     –

), to continue the war against the Portuguese.
  e Almohads also had to defend the eastern edge of their territory in
North Africa from hostile Arab and Berber tribes.
But total war had yet to be invented and, despite the political
and military turbulence of the     s, in    
 the Spanish Muslim
pilgrim, Ibn Jubayr, travelled to Alexandria on a Genoese ship.
  en, after completing his pilgrimage to Mecca and visiting
Baghdad and Damascus, he crossed into the Crusader Kingdom of
Jerusalem and travelled on to Acre, where he again chose a Genoese
ship for his homeward journey. Despite the   ghting between
Saladin’s armies and those of the Crusader Kingdom, there was not
much of a frontier between Muslim and Christian territory. When

and yet Muslim and Christian travellers will come and go between them
without interference . . . still the caravans passed successively from Egypt
to Damascus, going through the lands of the Franks without impediment
from them. In the same way the Muslims continuously journeyed
from Damascus to Acre (through Frankish territory), and likewise not
one of the Christian merchants was stopped or hindered (in Muslim
territories) . . .   e Christians impose a tax on the Muslims in their land
which gives them full security; and likewise the Christian merchants pay
a tax upon their goods in Muslim lands. Agreement exists between them,
and there is equal treatment in all cases.   e soldiers engage themselves
in their war, while the people are at peace and the world goes to him who
conquers  . . .   e state of these countries is more astonishing than our
story can convey. 
Ibn Jubayr was born in      in Valencia in what was then Muslim
Spain. He set out on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, in    
. It
was related shortly before, while he was a senior administrator in
the service of the Almohad governor of Granada, that the governor
pressed a goblet of wine upon him and, when Ibn Jubayr tried to
refuse, he was forced by the governor to drink seven goblets of wine.
On seeing Ibn Jubayr’s religiously inspired anguish, the governor
repented, however, and presented him with seven goblets of gold.
But Ibn Jubayr then resigned from his service and resolved to go
on a penitential pilgrimage. It is a good story and, like so many
good stories, it may not actually be true. Ibn Jubayr himself makes
no reference to such a shameful episode or to any resolve of his to
undertake a penitential pilgrimage.   e chain of transmission for
the story is weak. Al-Maqqari, a seventeenth-century North African
biographer and chronicler, took it from Ibn al-Khatib, a fourteenthcentury
Andalusian vizier and polygraph, who in turn took it from
a certain Ibn Raqiq. Moreover, there are relatively few accounts of
Muslims making penitential hajjs. It is also puzzling that Ibn Jubayr
  Ibn Jubayr, pp.
  – .
   THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
should have left Spain in such haste that once he arrived in Mecca
he had to wait there for eight months before the pilgrimage rituals
commenced in the month of Dhu’l-Hijja. (It is a mystery how he
spent his days during this long wait.)
  e hajj is one of the   ve pillars of Islam, together with faith,
prayer, alms-giving and fasting. Every adult Muslim is obliged
to perform the hajj at least once in the course of his or her life, so
long as it is possible to do so. Poverty or danger have been the most
common reasons for not performing the hajj. In this period the long
journey from Andalusia and the Maghreb had become hazardous
and, moreover, many pilgrims from the west brought back reports of
being badly treated by the Egyptian, Syrian or Meccan authorities. As
a consequence, some jurists in the western Islamic lands had decreed
that in the current state of things the hajj was not compulsory for
Andalusians or North Africans.
Some individuals chose to go on the hajj for reasons that were not
purely religious: a lot of trade was conducted in Mecca during the
pilgrimage season. Also, undertaking the hajj sometimes served as a
pious pretext for a minister or senior o  cial to resign his o  ce and
so escape from service to a ruler who had become either onerous or
dangerous (and it is possible that this was so in Ibn Jubayr’s case).
More commonly, Muslim scholars – particularly North African and
Andalusian scholars – travelled to the eastern Islamic lands in quest of
knowledge (talab al-‘ilm). In particular they sought hadiths: sayings
and deeds of the Prophet and his Companions, which might serve as
a guide to points of religious law and a guide to pious living. Since
there was a prejudice against the written transmission of knowledge,
scholars sought to accumulate hadiths through oral transmission.
Hadiths came with long isnads (chains of authorities on which the
hadiths were based): ‘I was told by so-and-so, who had it from such a
name, that he heard from …’ and so on. Collectors of hadiths might
travel great distances to sit at the feet of a reliable transmitter and,
since it was desirable to have as few transmitters as possible in the
chain running down from the Prophet, the older the transmitter
the better. Ibn Battuta’s account of his globe-trotting travels in the
fourteenth century devoted many pages to the hadith scholars he had
INTRODUCTION BY ROBERT IRWIN   
studied with in Damascus and the consequent diplomas (ijazas) that
entitled him to transmit what he had learnt.
After his   rst pilgrimage Ibn Jubayr seems not to have returned
to administration in Spain. He undertook two further pilgrimages,
which he did not trouble to chronicle, after which he ended up as a
teacher of Su  sm and hadiths in Alexandria. (In the course of his hajj
Ibn Jubayr noted that many Muslims from north-west Africa had
settled in Alexandria.) It would be plausible, then, to suppose that,
besides the primary aim of ful  lling one of the   ve canonical Muslim
duties, Ibn Jubayr on his   rst pilgrimage might have nourished
the subsidiary ambition of sitting at the feet of aged and learned
transmitters of hadiths in the east, which is where the top scholars in
religious studies were known to be. Yet this seems not to have been
the case and (or at least), if he spent time in Mecca, Medina, Baghdad
and Damascus in the somewhat dry study of centuries-old traditions
about the Prophet, he kept quiet about it.
His passion was for something else. Indeed, his passion was for
holy passion.   ere is a premonitory hint of it in his account of one
of the sermons he attended in Medina, after leaving Mecca.   is was
delivered by a learned scholar of religious law, Sadr al-Din of Isfahan.
As they listened to him, ‘men’s spirits were carried away in contrition
and emotion’. At the end of the sermon,
people threw o  their turbans and stretched forth their arms to the tomb
of the Prophet – may God bless and preserve him – praying for this man,
weeping and imploring. I never saw a night of more tears and contrition
than this. 
Ibn Jubayr reported that Sadr al-Din was the greatest man that he
encountered in his eastern travels.
Months later, in Baghdad, his narrative, so often dryly descriptive
and enumerative, catches   re once more. A large part of the city was
  y-blown and in ruins and most of its citizens were horrible, but it
was in Baghdad that Ibn Jubayr met some truly remarkable teachers
  Ibn Jubayr, pp.    –
.
   THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and preachers. One such, Shaykh Radi al-Din al-Qazwini, gave a
lecture on the Qur’an, hadiths and the religious sciences:
His disquisition was learned and homiletic, grave, quiet and persuasive,
revealing God’s blessing and his calmness of soul; and the souls of the
humble did not grudge the   owing of tears, especially at the end of the
convocation when his exhortations dissolved them in contrition and
weeping, and caused the repentant to rush into his arms. How many were
the forelocks he cut!
 [For a man to allow his forelock to be cut o  was a
sign of repentance.]
  is was soon followed by the sermon of Jamal al-Din Abu’l-Fada’il
ibn ’Ali al-Jawzi, at the end of which the
penitent raised loud their voices and fell upon him like moths on a lamp.
Each one o  ered him his forelock, and this he cut, and, touching each
man’s head, he prayed for him. Some fainted and he raised them to him
in his arms. We witnessed an awesome spectacle which   lled the soul
with repentance and contrition, reminding it of the dreads of the Day of
Resurrection. 
  ere was a similar response to another of his sermons:
Eyes poured forth their tears, and souls revealed their secret longings.
Men threw themselves upon him, confessing their sins and showing
their penitence. Hearts and minds were enravished, and there was great
commotion.   e senses lost their understanding and discernment, and
there was no way to restraint. 
Ibn Jubayr went to yet a third performance of this man:
We witnessed one notable example of his powers: through his exhortations
the souls of those present rose as clouds, and from their tears there poured a
heavy shower of rain.   en at the end of his meeting, he delivered some erotic

verses, ardently mystical and emotional. At last weakness overcame him and
he sprang from the pulpit, sad and distressed, but leaving all repenting and
sadly crying, ‘Alas, what a pity!’   e weepers moved round him like a millstone,
wailing and all still unrestored from their intoxication. 
Ibn Jubayr was enchanted by the rhetoric of the scholars of Baghdad.
He had encountered nothing like it in the Hejaz or in the western
Islamic lands.
In medieval Islamic culture eloquence was esteemed as ‘licit magic’
(sihr halal), something capable of producing magical e  ects. (Ibn Jubayr
actually uses the phrase ‘licit magic’ when evoking the eloquence of
a preacher from Khorasan. ) One of the legally permissible e  ects of
this rhetorical magic was to cause the listener to brie  y lose his senses.
Tarab means ‘lively emotion’, ‘excitement’ or ‘agitation of heart or
mind by joy or grief resulting in loss of self-control’; istataraba means
‘he sought lively emotion’.   e tenth-century man of letters and
musicologist Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani compiled the Kitab al-Aghani
(Book of Songs), a compendious text which not only gave the lyrics
of songs performed at the court of Harun al-Rashid but also gave the
context of their composition, performance and reception. Often that
reception resulted in the tearing of robes, slapping of cheeks, weeping
and fainting – all of them manifestations of tarab.
It seems possible that it was during his pilgrimage that Ibn Jubayr
was converted to Su  sm.   e khanqas (Su  monasteries) that he
encountered in Damascus made a great impression on him.   e Su  s
follow a noble path, and their social conduct is admirable.   e style of their
ritual in worship is remarkable, and excellent is their custom of assembling
to listen to impassioned music. In these ecstasied and abstracted states the
world forsakes them, such is their rapture and transport. In a word, all
their a  airs are wonderful, and they hope for a future life of bliss and
felicity.

  THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
He had been similarly impressed by an ascetic Su  whom he
encountered in the vicinity of Harran.

Ibn Jubayr was an aesthete and he also had a passion – though a
more muted one – for architecture.   is comes over most strongly
in his description of the Great Mosque of Damascus. Having   rst
announced that there would be no point in describing it, he then
goes on to describe it in great detail: its dimensions, pillars, naves,
dome, cupolas, courtyard, minarets, basins, mosaics, gateway, portals,
clepsydra, mihrabs (prayer niches) and maqsuras (enclosures reserved
for the politically prominent), and attached shops. His descriptions
of other mosques are similarly meticulous, though less rhapsodic. He
possessed a surprisingly large vocabulary of architectural terms. But
his appreciation of architecture was not restricted to Muslim religious
buildings. He marvelled at the pharaonic temple of Ikhmim in Upper
Egypt and described its architecture and decoration before concluding
that ‘this temple has a sublime grandeur, and its sight is one of the
wonders of the world, beyond description or de  ning  . . .  God
embraces all knowledge of it and knows its meaning.’   He found
another architectural marvel in Palermo.   is was the Church of the
Antiochian (also known as La Martorana), which he judged to be
‘beyond dispute the most wonderful edi  ce in the world’.   On the
other hand, this aesthete judged that Harran was a town ‘with no
beauty about it’.  
Apart from architecture, he also had an eye for the women,
particularly Christian women. He looked on a Christian wedding
that was taking place in the Crusader port of Tyre and was particularly
taken with the bride and her beautiful dress: ‘We were thus given the
chance of seeing this alluring sight, from the seducement of which
God preserve us.’ 
 Again in Palermo, where even the Christian

women followed the practice of veiling but also wore robes of goldembroidered
silks: ‘We invoke God’s protection for this description
which enters the gates of absurdity and leads to the vanities of
indulgence, and seek protection also from the bewitchment that leads
to dotage.’  
Ibn Jubayr also had an eye for the beauties of landscape, which
he described very well.   e Qur’an instructs believers to admire the
world that Allah has created for them. To marvel at God’s creation
was, then, a pious act. Whole cosmographies devoted to marvels were
compiled by the Muslims. If an artefact was perceived of as being
beautiful the common response was not ‘jamil!’ (beautiful) but ‘ajib!’
(amazing). Sinbad, in the course of his seven legendary voyages,
encountered many marvels, some of which were monsters; but it was
not only the monsters that were marvellous in Sinbad’s eyes but also
the trees and plants, and the amazing natural wealth of the islands
and littorals of the Indian Ocean. Similarly, the non-  ctional rilhla,
or travel genre, commonly encompassed accounts of the marvels of
the natural world, the monuments of antiquity, and the supernatural.
  e temple at Ikhmim was a marvel. So were the statues of crocodiles
at Gizeh, which kept the Nile free of real crocodiles for three miles in
either direction.   e Great Mosque of Damascus was miraculously
free of spiders and sparrows. Bitumen, encountered in Iraq, was
something to marvel over: ‘God indeed creates what he wishes.’
To return to Ibn Jubayr’s accounts of architecture, he is somewhat
obsessive in his registering the dimensions of everything and counting
all various features of the buildings through which he paced. For
example,
  e length of the Mosque of the Prophet [in Medina] – may God bless
and preserve him – is three hundred cubits, and the breadth two hundred.
  e number of its columns is three hundred and its minarets three. Its
area is twenty-four Maghribi maraja’, which is   fty square cubits.  
   Ibn Jubayr, p.
  .
   Ibn Jubayr, p.    .
  THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Similar details follow about the mosque of Jerusalem. He was
equally assiduous in logging the days and months of his travelling,
as well as the distances he covered by land and sea. So, then, who
was Ibn Jubayr writing for? Was his book aimed at those of his
compatriots who would undertake the hajj on some future date? Or
for those who would never go on the hajj?   ough this is an obvious
question to ask, it is impossible to be certain of the answer. However,
the meticulous quality of his descriptions, and his determination to
make the reader see what he had seen, rather suggests that he was
writing for those who would never actually travel to Mecca; and, as
already noted, Andalusian and Maghribi fuqaha (jurists) were urging
a boycott of the hajj.
Whatever his intentions may have been, today Ibn Jubayr is
customarily read at cross purposes to those intentions, and his
narrative is mined for historical facts. Admittedly his narrative is
a remarkably rich and interesting source of such facts. Particularly
apparent is his repeatedly expressed admiration for Saladin, the great
Sultan and war leader against the in  dels in Syria. Not only does
Ibn Jubayr admire Saladin for his conduct of the jihad, but he also
praises him for his abolition of the tax on pilgrims. Yet Saladin and
the Almohad rulers, Yusuf and al-Mansur, were enemies, and in     
Saladin sent troops to assist Arab tribes who were   ghting Almohad
forces in the region of Gafsa (in what is today Tunisia). As a loyal
subject of the Almohads, Ibn Jubayr looked forward to the day when
they should conquer Egypt and he was encouraged in this by certain
prophecies.   us Saladin’s construction of bridges in the Nile Delta
could be seen as a sign of this:
To the Egyptians, the construction of these bridges is a warning of
a coming event, for they see in it an augury that the Almohads will
conquer it and the eastern regions. But God is the Knower of His hidden
a  airs.  
   Ibn Jubayr, p.   .
INTRODUCTION BY ROBERT IRWIN


An apocalyptic prophecy also circulated that Berbers with yellow
  ags would attack and plunder Egypt, and in some versions of the
prophecy they would go on to Syria as well.   Ibn Jubayr believed that
most Egyptians hoped that the Almohads would conquer Egypt. As
evidence of this he cited their superstitious story of two statues on
towers located between the Mosque of Ibn Tulun and Old Cairo.
When the statue facing east fell, it foreshadowed the conquest of
Egypt by Saladin and his Turkish army. If the statue facing west
should fall, that would betoken the conquest of Egypt from the west
and that army would be an Almohad one.
  ere remains nothing but the happy prospect of an Almohade conquest
of these lands, and attentively they watch for it one auspicious morning,
being certain of it, and expecting it as they expect the (last) hour, the
ful  lment of the promise of which no one feels doubt.  
  ough Ibn Jubayr made no attempt in what he wrote in the Rihla
(journey) to resolve his partisanship for the Almohads with his praise
for Saladin, perhaps his   nal decision to settle in Saladin’s Egypt
re  ected a slowly growing disillusionment with the Almohads.
Ibn Jubayr has been much quoted as a source on the status of
Muslims in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and particularly on his
observation that they paid less in taxes than their co-religionists in
that part of Syria that was under Muslim rule. His admiration for
Saladin and certain preachers and Su  s notwithstanding, Ibn Jubayr
had a rather sour view of the Muslims in the east:

Judged by the standards of strict Almohad puritanism, these people
were either heretics or at best negligent in their religion:
  e lands of God that most deserve to be puri  ed by the sword, and
cleansed of their sins and impurities by blood shed in holy war are these
Hejaz lands, for what they are about in loosening the ties of Islam, and
dispossessing pilgrims of their property and shedding their blood.   ose
of the Andalusian jurisprudents who believe the pilgrims should be
absolved from this religious obligation believe rightly . . . May God soon
correct and purify this place by relieving the Muslims of these destructive
schismatics with the swords of the Almohades, the defenders of the Faith,
God’s confederates, possessing righteousness and truth.  
Syria was no better, for there the heretics outnumbered the
orthodox.   Moreover, those Muslims who lived under the rule of the
Franks of the Crusader states were living in sin: ‘  ere can be no
excuse in the eyes of God for a Muslim to stay in any in  del country,
save when passing through it, while the way lies clear in Muslim
lands.’  
In the light of this last verdict, Ibn Jubayr’s observations about
Muslims living under Norman rule in Sicily are of particular interest.
At   rst he was favourably impressed. King William II spent money
rescuing Ibn Jubayr and other Muslims from their ship, which was
foundering o  the Sicilian coast. Moreover, William had taken the
trouble to learn Arabic. Muslim eunuchs enjoyed a high status at
William’s court. (Incidentally, in his translation Broadhurst several
times translated fatan and   tyan as ‘page’ and ‘pages’, which may be
the meanings in a modern dictionary, but in the context of the times
and in Ibn Jubayr’s narrative they mean ‘white eunuch’ and ‘white
eunuchs’.) Sicilian Muslims prospered and were well treated by the
Christians.

But these were   rst impressions. Right from the outset of his
travels he seems to have been writing an ongoing diary that then
became his   nished Rihla in which he did not go back to correct
early misperceptions. In the case of his Sicilian sojourn, the longer he
stayed there the bleaker became his assessment of the condition of the
Muslims under Christian rule. By the time he arrived in Trapani he
felt moved to write the following:
During our stay in this town, we learned painful things about the grievous
state of the Muslims in this island concerning their relations with the
worshippers of the Cross – may God destroy them – their humiliation and
abasement, their state of vassalage under the Christians, and the duress of
the king, bringing the calamities and misfortunes of apostasy on those of
their women and children for whom God had ordained such su  ering. 

  ere were forced conversions and con  scations. We also learn that
William’s agents in Sicily were interrogating all new arrivals on the
island for intelligence about Constantinople. (Such interrogations
were standard practice in medieval ports.) At the same time, these
o  cers were trying to prevent ships sailing from Sicily in case the
Greeks got wind of William’s invasion plans. But the master of the
ship that Ibn Jubayr boarded used bribery to get them away.
Ibn Jubayr’s narrative is also an important source on shipping in
the Mediterranean, for he was knowledgeable about ships and took a
keen interest in those he sailed in. In this period, ships followed certain
  xed routes, tramping and island hopping were common and, as
Fernand Braudel remarked in his famous study of the Mediterranean,
‘great stretches of the sea were as empty as the Sahara’. Moreover there
were very few sailings at all in winter. Ships sailing to the east from
Spain or North Africa tended to sail from island to island – Sardinia,
Sicily, Crete, Cyprus – using them as navigation aids, seeking their
shelter from winds blowing from the north and from pirates, as
well as sometimes taking on water and provisions from the islands.
  ose islands were all under Christian control. Sailing in the opposite

  THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
direction was more di  cult, since there were only two times of the
year when there was likely to be a favourable east wind: from mid-
April to late May and then again for two weeks in October. Ibn Jubayr
chose to travel out and to return on Genoese ships. Genoa enjoyed
good relations with Saladin’s sultanate, the Kingdom of Jerusalem,
and the Almohad regime, and its ships o  ered more security from
corsairs.   e Genoese specialized in maritime trade with North Africa.
  ough Acre was one of the chief ports of the Kingdom of Jerusalem,
its harbour was too small for large ships and therefore lighters were
needed to convey passengers and baggage out to them. At Acre the
captain of the Genoese ship that Ibn Jubayr had chosen to travel
back on was so desperate to catch a sudden favourable wind that Ibn
Jubayr almost missed his passage. Once he had reached Sicily he had
to wait three and a half months before a favourable wind allowed him
to complete his journey. By the way, he declared that Acre resembled
Constantinople in size, but he had never seen Constantinople; so how
did he know?
Occasionally Ibn Jubayr chose to compose in a high style, and
on those occasions he wrote in rhymed prose, sacri  cing accuracy to
hyperbole, as in the opening of his description of Damascus. He had
made a special study of the Maqamat of al-Hariri (    –    ) and
modelled his high style on that of al-Hariri. Al-Hariri’s Maqamat,
one of the masterpieces of medieval Arabic literature, consists of
  fty rhymed prose narratives in which the rascal who is doing the
narrating reveals himself to be the master of all the tricks of eloquence
and allusion. More prosaically, Ibn Jubayr often resorts to the trope of
claiming that such and such a thing is beyond his powers to describe.
When he ends an account of something with ‘God knows best’ it
means that he does not believe a word of it (as was the case with
the wonder-working crocodile statues, or the alleged house of Eve in
Jeddah). He uses invocations of God to mark chapter breaks.
Finally, the translator, Ronald Joseph Callender Broadhurst
( 
  – 
  ), was a surprisingly interesting man. He was not an
academic Arabist but he had acquired excellent Arabic in Palestine.
After entering the Colonial Service in  
  , he became a brigadier
in Jordan’s Arab Legion and became the right-hand man of its

commander, John Bagot Glubb (another accomplished Arabist
and later a historian of the Middle East). Sadly, in the long run he
and Glubb fell out as Broadhurst judged that Glubb favoured the
Bedouin and neglected the interests of the urban Arabs. Broadhurst,
on the other hand, had many friends among Jordan’s Arab elite and
was   rst the friend and then the aide-de-camp of the ruler, the Emir
Abdullah. He left the Middle East in  
   and retired to Northern
Ireland where, in ‘the rustic seclusion of an Irish study’, he produced
his translation of Ibn Jubayr, and where he also produced A History of
the Ayyubid Sultans of Egypt, Translated from the Arabic of al-Maqrîzî
(posthumously published, New York,  
  ). From time to time, as he
worked on these translations, he seems to have sought the advice of
A. J. Arberry, the   omas Adams Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, a
scholar who was particularly noted for his translations, as well as that
of Hamilton Gibb, professor at the School of Oriental and African
Studies and an expert on the career of Saladin. Apart from turning
himself into an amateur though capable Orientalist, Broadhurst also
became prominent in Unionist politics, and in  
 
 he became a
member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

An Account of the Events that Befell upon
Certain Journeys
The writing of this chronicle was begun on Friday
the 30th of the month of Shawwal, 578 (A.H.)X
[25th of February, 1183] at sea, opposite Jabal Shulayr
[Sierra Nevada]
may God with His favour grant us safety
[8th of Shawwal to the end of the month of Dhu
'1-Qa'dah 578=4th of February to the 27th of March,
1183.]
AHMAD IBN HASSAN and Muhammad ibn Jubayr left
x"\Granada - may God preserve it - on their pilgrimage to
the blessed Hejaz - may God give easement and help and reveal
His beneficent works - at the first hour of Thursday2 the 8th
of Shawwal 578 (A.H.), which fell, according to the foreigners
[i.e. non-Arabs] on the 3rd of February (1183).
We passed through Jayyan [Jaen] that we might despatch
some business, and left it at the first hour of Monday the 19th
of the month of Shawwal, being the 14th of February. Our
first stage from there was to the fortress of al-Qabdhaq3 [Alcaudete].
Thence we moved to the fortress of Qabrah [Cabra],
to the city of Istijah [Ecija], to the fortress of Ushunah [Osuna],
to Shallabar [Jehver], to the fortress of Arkush [Arcos], to the
burgh known as the Burgh of Qashmah* [Casma] which is
a burgh belonging to Madinat Ibn al-Salim [Medina Sidonia],
and then to the island of Tarif [Tarifa] which we reached on
Monday the 26di of the month (of Shawwal). At midday on
Tuesday the (twenty) second (of February) God granted us
44 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR.
an easy crossing of the sea to Qasr Masmudah [Alcazar].
Praise be to God.
On the morning of Wednesday the 28th of the month, we
removed to Sabtah [Ceuta] where we found a Rumi5 Genoese
ship about to sail to al-Iskandariyah [Alexandria] by the power
of Great and Glorious God, and with His help we embarked;
and at midday on Thursday the 29th of the month, or the 24th
of February, we set sail with the power and help of God Most
High. There is no God but He.
Our course lay along the Andalusian coast, but this we left
on Thursday the 6th of Dhu '1-Qa'dah [3rd of March] when
we were opposite Daniyah [Denia]. The morning of Friday
the 7th of the month we were off the island of Yabisah [Iviza],
on Saturday the island of Majorca, and on Sunday we were
off Minorca. From Ceuta to Minorca is eight majari; a majra
being one hundred miles.8 We left the coast of this island, and
early on the night of Tuesday the n t h of the month, being
the 8th of March, the coast of the island of Sardinia all at once
appeared before us about a mile or less away. Between the
islands of Sardinia and Minorca He about four hundred miles.
It had been a crossing remarkable for its speed.
That night there fell upon us from shoreward a mighty
storm with a wind which God Most High released at the time
we met the land, but from which He preserved and delivered
us. Praise be to Him for that. On the morning of Tuesday
a tempest rose and the sea raged, so that we remained hovering
off the coast of Sardinia until Wednesday. As we lay in
this parlous plight, with all directions locked by the storm and
being unable to distinguish the east from the west, God revealed
to us a Rumi ship approaching. When it was beside us, we
asked whither it was going and were told that it was bound
for the island, of Sicily and had come from Cartagena in the
province of Murcia. Without our knowledge, we had been
sailing before this ship on its course; and thereupon we took
to following in its wake. God is the Disposer of all things,
there is no God but He.
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (578) 45
There then rose before us a promontory of Sardinia, but we
drew away and approached afresh so that we arrived at another
promontory off that coast, called Qusmarkah7 [Cape St. Mark
at the north of the Gulf of Oristano], an anchorage well-known
to mariners. There, at noon on Wednesday, we anchored,
together with the other ship. In this place there are the remains
of an ancient building which was described to us as once having
been a Jewish habitation. We sailed thence at midday on Sunday
the 16th of the month. During our stay in the harbour,
we had renewed our supplies of water, Wood, and victuals.
A Muslim who knew the Rumi tongue had gone down with
a party of Rum to the nearest inhabited parts, and we learnt
that he had seen a group of Muslim prisoners, about eighty
between men and women, being sold in the market. The
enemy - may God destroy them - had just returned with them
from the sea-coasts of Muslim countries. May God's mercy
overtake them. On Friday, the third day after we had anchored
there, the lord of the island came to the harbour with a group
of cavaliers. The leading Rum in the ship went down and met
him, staying long with him before they left and he departed
to his dwelling.
We left the other ship at its moorings, some of her people
being absent in the town, when a favourable wind arose on
the night of Tuesday the 18th of Dhu 1-Qa'dah, the 15th of
March; and in the last quarter of the night, we parted from the
coast of Sardinia. It has a long coast, and we had sailed beside
it for about two hundred miles. The complete circuit of the
island, as we were told, is more than five hundred miles. God
smoothed our way and delivered us from its seas; for they are
the most perilous of the journey and at most times cannot be
traversed. For this may God be praised.
Early on the night of Wednesday the wind blew with violence
upon us, throwing the sea into turmoil and bringing rain
and driving it with such force that it was like a shower of
arrows. The affair became serious and our distress increased.
Waves like mountains came upon us from every side. Thus
46 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
we passed the night, filled with despair, but hoping yet for
relief in the morning to lighten something of what had fallen
on us. But day came, it was Wednesday the 19th of Dhu
'1-Qa'dah, with increasing dread and anguish. The sea raged
more, the horizon blackened, and the wind and rain rose to
a tumult so that the sails of the ship could not withstand it
and recourse was had to the small sails. The wind caught one
of these and tore it, and broke the spar to which the sails are
fixed and which they call the qariyah [from the Gr. Xepcncc,
'a mast']. Despair then overcame our spirits and the hands
of the Muslims were raised in supplication to Great and
Glorious God. We remained in this state all that day,
and only when night had fallen did there come some abatement,
so that we moved throughout it with great speed
under bare masts, and came that day opposite the island of
Sicily.
We spent that night, the night of Thursday, wavering
between hope and despair, but widi the break of day, God
spread His mercy so that the clouds dispersed, the wind abated,
the sun shone and die sea was calmed. Men rejoiced, conviviality
returned, and despair departed. Praise be to God who
showed us the greatness of His power and restored us with
His gracious mercy and bounteous compassion. Praise in requital
for His grace and favour.
On that morning of Thursday the coast of Sicily appeared
to us. We had already passed the greater part of it, and but
little remained. Rumi sea-captains who were present, and Muslims
who had gone through journeys and storms at sea, all
agreed that they had never in their lives seen such a tempest.
The description of it diminishes the reality.
Between the coasts of Sardinia and Sicily he about four hundred
miles. We moved along the coast of Sicily for more than
two hundred miles, and dien went back and forth beside it,
for the wind had fallen. On the afternoon of Friday the 21st
of the month, we sailed from the place where we had anchored,
and early that night we parted from the land. By Saturday
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (578) 47
morning we were far distant from it. There then appeared to
us the mountain which has the volcano. It is a huge mountain,
rising into the skies and clothed, in snow. We were told that
in fine weather it can be seen across the sea for more than a
hundred miles.
We now took to the main sea. The nearest land we hoped
to meet was the island of Aqritish [Crete]. It is a Rumi island,
owing allegiance to the ruler of Constantinople, and between
it and Sicily he seven hundred miles. God by His grace is the
Guarantor of help and easement. The length of this island of
Crete is about three hundred miles. On the night of Tuesday
the 25th of the month (of Dhu '1-Qa'dah), the 22nd of March,
according to reckoning we were moving along its coast, but
we could not see it. In the morning we parted from it, aiming
for our destination. Between this island and Alexandria he six
hundred miles or thereabouts. And on the morning of Wednesday
the 26th there appeared the mainland connected with
Alexandria, and which is known as Barr al-Gharb8 [Land of
the West]. We sailed along it to a place called, we were
told, Jaza'ir al-Hamam [The Islands of the Doves].6 We
were also told that between this place and Alexandria he
about four hundred miles. We sailed on with this coast to
our right.
On the morning of Saturday the 29th of the month, God
gave us the good news of our safety with the appearance of the
lighthouse of Alexandria some twenty miles away. Praise be
to God for that; praise due for the abundance of His favour
and generous works. At the end of the fifth hour of that day
we anchored in the harbour of the town, and then went down
to the shore. To God we shall call for help, by His grace, in
what remains (of our journey). Thirty days we had been at
sea, and we had gone ashore on the 31st, for we had embarked
on Thursday the 29th of Shawwal and disembarked on Saturday
the 29th of Dhu '1-Qa'dah, the 26th of March. Praise be
to God for the help and easement He bestowed. And Him,
exalted is He, we petition to complete His benefactions in
48 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
bringing us to our longed-for aim, and speedily restoring us,
happily and in health, to our native land. He indeed is the
Benefactor. There is no God but He.
For lodging we stayed at an inn10 known as the Inn of the
Coppersmiths near to the soap-works.

The Month of Dhu }l-Hijjah of the Same Year
[28th of March-25th. of April, 1183]
THE first day of the month was a Sunday and the day after
our arrival in Alexandria. The day of our landing, one of
the first things we saw was the coming on board of the agents
of the Sultan to record all that had been brought in the ship.
All the Muslims in it were brought forward one by one, and
their names and descriptions, together with the names of their
countries, recorded. Each was questioned as to what merchandise
or money he had, that he might pay zakat,11 without
any enquiry as to what portion of it had been in their possession
for a complete year and what had not. Most of them were on
their way to discharge a religious duty and had nothing but
the (bare) provisions for the journey. But they were compelled
to pay the zakat without being questioned as to what
had been possessed by them for the complete year and what
had not.
Ahmad ibn Hassan of our number was called down to be
questioned as to the news of the west [i.e. from Spain and
North Africa] and as to the ship's cargo. Under watch he was
in turn conducted first to the Sultan, then to the Qadi, then
to the officials of the Customs, and then to a group of the
Sultan's suite, and after being questioned concerning everything,
and his statements recorded, he was released.
The Muslims were then ordered to take their belongings,
and what remained of their provisions, to the shore, where
there were attendants responsible for them and for carrying
to the Customs all that they had brought ashore. There they
were called one by one, and the possessions of each were produced.
The Customs was packed to choking. All their goods,
great and small, were searched and confusedly thrown together,
while hands were thrust into their waistbands in search of what
52 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
might be within. The owners were then put to oath whether
they had aught else not discovered. During all this, because of
the confusion of hands and the excessive throng, many possessions
disappeared. After this scene of abasement and shame, for
which we pray God to recompense us amply, they [the pilgrims]
were allowed to go.
There is no doubt that this is one of the matters concealed
from the great Sultan known as Salah al-Din [Saladin]. If he
heard of it, from what is related of his justice and leanings to
pity, he would end it. But God is sufficient to the Faithful
in this unhappy case, and (in the life to come) they will
pay the zakat with the happiest heart. In the lands of this
man [Saladin], we found nothing bad that merits mention
save this affair, which was provoked by the officials of
the Customs.
A note on some of the features and antiquities of Alexandria
First there is the fine situation of the city, and the spaciousness
of its buildings. We have never seen a town with broader
streets, or higher structures, or one more ancient and beautiful.
Its markets also are magnificent. A remarkable thing about the
construction of the city is that the buildings below the ground
are like those above it and are even finer and stronger, because
the waters of the Nile wind underground beneath the houses
and alleyways. The wells are connected, and flow into each
other. We observed many marble columns and slabs of height,
amplitude, and splendour such as cannot be imagined. You will
find in some of its avenues columns that climb up to and choke
the skies, and whose purpose and the reason for whose erection
none can tell. It was related to us that in ancient times
they supported a building reserved for philosophers and the
chief men of the day. God knows best, but they seem to be
for the purpose of astronomical observations.
One of the greatest wonders that we saw in this city was the
lighthouse which Great and Glorious God had erected by the
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 53
hands of those who were forced to such labour as 'a sign to
those who take warning from examining the fate of others'
[Koran XV, 75] and as a guide to voyagers, for without it
they could not find the true course to Alexandria. It can be
seen for more than seventy miles, and is of great antiquity.
It is most strongly built in all directions and competes with
the skies in height. Description of it falls short, the eyes fail
to comprehend it, and words are inadequate, so vast is the
spectacle.
We measured one of its four sides and found it to be more
then fifty arms' lengths. It is said that in height it is more than
one hundred and fifty qamah [one qamah=a man's height]. Its
interior is an awe-inspiring sight in its amplitude, with stairways
and entrances and numerous apartments, so that he who
penetrates and wanders through its passages may be lost. In
short, words fail to give a conception of it. May God not let
it cease to be an affirmation of Islam and (for that creed) preserve
it. At its summit is a mosque having the qualities of
blessedness, for men are blessed by praying therein. On Thursday
the 5th of Dhu '1-Hij|jah, we went up to this blessed mosque
and prayed in it. We saw such marvels of construction as cannot
faithfully be described.
Amongst the glories of this city, and owing in truth to the
Sultan, are the colleges12 and hostels erected there for students
and pious men from other lands. There each may find lodging
where he might retreat, and a tutor to teach him the branch
of learning he desires, and an allowance to cover all his needs.
The care of the Sultan for these strangers from afar extends to
the assigning of baths in which they may cleanse themselves
when they need, to the setting up of a hospital for the treatment
of those of them who are sick, and to the appointment
of doctors to attend to them. At their disposal are servants
charged with ministering to them in the manner prescribed
both as regards treatment and sustenance. Persons have also
been appointed to it who may visit those of the strangers who
are too modest to come to the hospital, and who can thus
c
54 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
describe their condition to the doctors, who would then be
answerable for their cure.
One of the Sultan's most generous acts was the allotting of
two loaves daily for each of the Moorish ibna al-sabil [sons of
the road],13 whatever their number; and for the daily distribution
he appointed a person he trusted. Every day two thousand
loaves or more, according to the lesser or greater number (of
beneficiaries), were regularly distributed. (To meet this) there
was his own personal awqaf [charitable endowments], apart
from what he allotted for the purpose from the zakat al-ain
[zakat on gold and silver]. He was insistent with those in charge
of this that when the fixed sums were inadequate, they should
draw upon his private purse.
As for his people in this city, they live in the height of ease
and comfort. No tax is exacted from them and no revenues
accrue to the Sultan himself in this city save the awqaf, which
are tied and devoted by his order to these purposes, and the
tribute of the Jews and Christians. Of the revenues of the zakat
al-ain in particular, he receives but three eighths, the other
five eighths being for the object described. The Sultan who
established these praiseworthy laws and prescribed these generous
- although not wholly applied - decrees is Salah al-Din
[Saladin] Abu 1-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub. May God bless
him with His peace and succour.
One of the strangest things that befell the strangers was that
some persons who sought to draw near to the Sultan with
advice had declared that the greater number of them received
a ration of bread which they did not need as means of sustenance,
since they would not have come save with provisions
enough. This counsel almost had its effect. But one day, when
the Sultan had gone out from the city to make an inspection, he
met a group of men who had been cast up from the desert
adjoining Tripoli and who were disfigured by hunger and
thirst. He asked them about their journey, and enquired what
they had with them, and they answered that they were on their
way to the Sacred House of God [The Ka'abah in Mecca].
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 55
They had come overland (they said) and had suffered the
tribulations of the desert. Saladin replied, 'Even if these men,
after enduring the pathless desert and sustaining the hardships
they encountered, had arrived bringing each his own weight
in gold and silver, they should still partake of and not be denied
the usage we have adopted for them. I marvel at those who
traduce such as these, and who seek to gain our favour by trying
to prevent what, in faithfulness to Great and Glorious God,
we feel to be our duty.' The memorable acts of the Sultan, his
efforts for justice, and his stands in defence of Islamic lands
are too numerous to count.
Another of the remarkable features of this city is that people
are as active in their affairs at night as they are by day. It has
more mosques than any other city if Islam, so much so that
men's estimates of their number vary. Some count more, some
less, the former reckoning up to twelve thousand, the latter
a smaller figure without being precise, although some say eight
thousand. There are others who give different figures, but in
short they are most numerous, there being four or five in
one place and sometimes they even adjoin each other. Each
has its own imam with a stipend from the Sultan, and some
of them receive monthly five Egyptian dinars which is ten
mu'mini;14 others receive more and some less. This is but one
of the great merits of the Sultan amongst others it would take
too long to describe, and one of the benefactions too many
to count.
We left Alexandria by the grace and help of God Most
High on the morning of Sunday the 8th of Dhu 'l-Hijjah,
the 3rd of April. Our first stage was to a place called Damanhur,
a walled town in a large plain which extends from Alexandria
to Misr. This plain [the delta] is wholly cultivated, and
is covered by the Nile when in flood. Right and left are
innumerable villages. The next day, Monday, we crossed the
Nile at a place called Sa in a ferry boat, and came to a place
called Birmah. It is a large village, with a market and all
56 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
conveniences. Early on the morning of Tuesday, which was the
Festival of the Sacrifice16 of the year 578, we shared in the
prayers in a place called Tandatah, a large and populous village,
where we observed a vast concourse being addressed by
the preacher in an eloquent and comprehensive discourse. Our
way then took us to a place named Subk, where we passed the
night. That day we had passed a pleasant place called Malij.
All along the road were continuous cultivations and orderly
villages.
Early on Wednesday morning we removed, and came to
the best village we had yet passed through. It is called Qalyub,
and is six miles from Cairo, with fine bazaars and a large congregational
mosque, superbly built. After that came Munyah,
also a fine place, and from there we moved to Cairo, the
Sultan's magnificent and extensive city. From there we passed
to Misr [old Cairo] the protected of God, and entered it, following
the afternoon prayers, on Wednesday the n t h of Dhu
'1-Hijjah, the 6th of April. May God accord us good fortune
in this city, and complete on our behalf His beneficent works
by bringing us to our longed-for end, and in His power and
strength, depriving us not of help and easement. Verily whatever
He wishes He can accomplish.
At daybreak on Wednesday we crossed the other branch of
the Nile, also by ferry boat, at a place called Dajwah. At Misr,
we lodged at the inn of Abu '1-Thana' in the Lane of the
Lamps beside the mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As, God's blessings
upon him. Our room was a large one at the door of the inn.
A note on Misr1* and Cairo and some of their wonderful
monuments
We shall begin by mentioning the monuments and blessed
shrines, which for their beneficence are preserved by Great
and Glorious God. Of such is the great tomb in Cairo in which
is kept the head of Husayn, the son of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib,17
may God hold them in favour. It is in a silver casket and over
it has been built a mausoleum so superb as to be beyond
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 57
description and beyond the powers of the mind to comprehend.
It is covered with various kinds of brocades, and surrounded
by white candles that are like large columns; smaller
ones are placed, for the most part, in candlesticks of pure silver
and of gilt. Silver lamps are hung from it and its whole upper
part is encircled with golden spheres like apples, skilfully executed
to resemble a garden and holding our eyes in spell by
its beauty. There too are various kinds of marble tessellated
with coloured mosaics of rare and exquisite workmanship such
as one cannot imagine nor come near to describing. The entrance
to this garden [mausoleum] is by a mosque like to it in grace
and elegance, with walls that are all marble in the style we
have just described. To the right and left of the mausoleum
are two chambers of exactly the same style and both leading
into it. A brocade covering of exquisite workmanship is hung
over all.
A strange thing we noticed as we entered this blessed mosque
was a stone set in the wall which faces him who enters. It is
very black and shining, reflecting the image of a man like a
new-polished Indian mirror.
We observed men kissing the blessed tomb, surrounding it,
throwing themselves upon it, smoothing with their hands the
Kiswah [covering] that was over it, moving round it in a
surging throng, calling out invocations, weeping and entreating
Glorious God to bless the hallowed dust, and offering up
humble supplications such as would melt tne heart and split
the hardest flint. A solemn thing it was, and an awe-inspiring
sight; God granted that we should share in the blessings of
that venerable shrine. This is but a flash, a fragment of its
description, only indicating what lies beyond; for it does not
behove the wise man to apply himself to its description, since
he must find himself incapable and incompetent. To be short,
I do not believe that in all existence there is a more superb
work or more exquisite and wonderful building. May God in
His grace and favour sanctify the noble bones that are within it.
The night of that day we passed in the cemetery known as
58 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
al-Qarafah. This also is one of the wonders of the world for
the tombs it contains of prophets - God's benedictions upon
them - of the kindred of Muhammad - May God hold them
in His favour - of his Companions, of the followers18 of the
Companions, of learned men and ascetics, and of saintly men
renowned for their miracles and of wonderful report. We shall
describe only those we saw ourselves.
There was the tomb of the son of the prophet Salih; that
of Rubil ibn Ya'qub ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim [Abraham], Khalil
al-Rahman [the Friend of God]19 - t h e blessings of God upon
them all; that of Asiyah, wife of Far'aun - may God hold her
in His favour; the tombs of the kindred of Muhammad - may
God hold them in His favour - being fourteen men and five
women. Over each of these is a splendid edifice, all being
exquisite monuments of wondrous construction. For their care,
persons have been appointed who live in them and receive a
monthly stipend. It is indeed a sight to marvel at.
A note on the tombs of the kindred of Muhammad
May God hold them in His favour
The tomb of 'Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn 'Ali - may God hold
him in His favour; that of the two sons of Ja'far ibn Muhammad
al-Sadiq - may God hold them in His favour; that of al-Qasim
ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq ibn Muhammad ibn 'Ali
Zayn al-' Abidin aforementioned - may God hold them in His
favour; the tombs of his sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn - may
God hold them in His favour; the tomb of his son 'Abdullah
ibn al-Qasim-may God hold him in His favour; that of his
son Yahya ibn al-Qasim and that of 'AH ibn 'Abdullah ibn
al-Qasim - may God hold them in His favour; that of his
brother 'Isa ibn 'Abdullah - may God hold him in His favour;
that of Yahya ibn al-Hasan ibn Zayd ibn al-Hasan - may God
hold them in His favour; that of Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah
ibn Muhammad al-Baqir ibn 'Ah Zayn al-'Abidin ibn
al-Husayn ibn 'AH - may God hold them in His favour; that of
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 59
Ja'far ibn Muhammad of the stem of'AH ibn al-Husayn - may-
God hold them in His favour. We were told that he was the
stepson of al-Malik - may God hold him in His favour.
The tombs of the Sharifat20 [noble ladies] of the House
of'Ali
May God hold them in His favour
The tomb of the noble lady Umm Kulthum, daughter of
al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far - may God hold them in
His favour; that of the noble lady Zaynab, daughter of Yahya
ibn Zayd ibn 'AH ibn al-Husayn ibn 'Ah-may God hold
them in His favour; that of Umm Kulthum, daughter of
Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq - may God hold them in His
favour; that of the noble lady Umm 'Abdullah ibn al-Qasim
ibn Mohammad - may God hold them in His favour. This
describes only the tombs of those noble 'Aluwiyah [descendants
of 'AH] that our eyes fell upon, but there are more. It was
told to us that among them is the honoured tomb of
Miriam, daughter of 'Ah ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him
in His favour - and although this is famous, we did not see it.
The names of the occupants of these venerable tombs we
discovered from the records engraved over them and the
unbroken oral traditions which confirm them, but God best
knows. Over each of these is a splendid edifice, all being most
exquisite monuments of wondrous construction. For their care,
persons have been appointed who live in them and receive a
monthly stipend. It is indeed a sight to marvel on.
A note on the tombs of some of the Companions of the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve them - in al-Qarafah
and the tombs of the followers of the Companions, imams,
learned men, ascetics and saintly men illustrious for their
miracles - may God hold them all in His favour
The writer must be absolved from judging the truth of all
this, for he did but copy the names he found inscribed upon
60 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the epitaphs, but, in short, their credibility prevails - if it pleases
Great and Glorious God.
The Tomb of Mu'adh ibn Jabal - may God hold him in
His favour; that of 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir al-Juhani the standard
bearer of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him; that
of the possessor of the mantle of the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him; that of Abu '1-Hasan, the jeweller of the
Prophet of God - may God bless and preserve him; that of
Sariyat al-Jabal-may God hold him in His favour; that of
Muhammad son of Abu Bakr the Faithful - may God hold
them both in His favour; the tomb of his sons - may God hold
them in His favour; that of Ahmad son of Abu Bakr the
Faithful - may God hold him in His favour; that of Asma'
daughter of Abu Bakr the Faithful - may God hold them both
in His favour; that of the son of Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam; that
of 'Abdullah son of Hudhafah al-Sahmi, Companion of the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve them; that of ibn
Halimah the foster-brother of the Prophet of God - may God
bless and preserve them.
The tombs of the imams, learned men, and ascetics
May God hold them all in His favour
The tomb of the Shafi'i imam - may God hold him in His
favour - a shrine superb in beauty and size. Over against it was
built a school the like of which has not been made in this
country, there being nothing more spacious or more finely
built. He who walks around it will conceive it to be itself a
separate town. Beside it is a bath and other conveniences, and
building continues to this day. The measureless expenditure on
it is controlled by the sheik, imam, ascetic, and man of learning
called Najm al-Din al-Khabushani. The Sultan of these
lands, Saladin, bounteously pays all for this purpose saying: 'Be
lavish in splendour and elegance; ours it will be to provide
all.' Glory to Him who made him Salah Dinihi ['the well
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 61
being of his religion'] like his name. We visited this man
Khabushani, to be blessed by his prayers, for we had heard
of him in Andalusia. We came upon him at his mosque in
Cairo in the closet in which he lives inside the mosque; and
a narrow closet it is. He prayed for us and we departed. Of all
the men of Egypt, we saw none like him.
There is also the tomb of al-Muzani, the friend of the Shafi'i
imam - may God hold him in His favour; of Ashab the friend
of Malik-may God hold him in His favour; of 'Abd al-
Rahman ibn al-Qasim, the friend of Malik - may God hold
them both in His favour; of Asbagh, the friend of Malik - may
God hold them both in His favour; of the qadi 'Abd al-Wahhab
- may God hold him in His favour; of 'Abdullah ibn 'Abd
al-Hakam and Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah ibn 'Abd al-Hakam
- may God hold them in His favour; of the learned jurisprudent,
preacher, and ascetic Abu '1-Hasan al-Dinawari - may
God hold him in His favour; of Bunan al-'Abid [the pious] -
may God hold him in His favour; of the pious, godly, .and
ascetic man known as Sahib al-Ibriq [He of the Ewer], whose
story is so wondrous for its miracles; of Abu Muslim al-
Khawlani - may God hold him in His favour; of the pious
lady known as al-'Ayna' - may God hold her in His favour; of
Rudhabari - may God hold him in His favour; of Muhammad
ibn Mas'ud ibn Muhammad ibn Harun al-Rashid, known as
al-Sabti [the Ceutan] - may God hold him in His favour; of
the pious Muqbil, the Ethiopian - may God hold him in His
favour; of Dhu 1-Nun ibn Ibrahim, the Egyptian - may God
hold him in His favour; of the qadi al-Anbari, where lies
the Speaker who, when placed in his niche, was heard to say,
'O Lord cause me to alight a blessed lighting, and Thou art
the best cause to alight' [Koran XXIII, 29] - may God hold
him in His favour; of the bride of whom is recorded the miracle
at the time of her first unveiling before her husband: nothing
stranger than it has ever been heard; of the silent one who is
said never to have spoken forty years; of al-'Asafiri; of 'Abd
al-'Aziz ibn Ahmad ibn 'Ah ibn al-Hasan al-Khawarizmi; of
62 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the jurisprudent and excellent preacher al-Jawhari and opposite
him those tombs of his companions - may God hold them in
His favour. The tomb of Shuqran, sheik of Dhu '1-Nun the
Egyptian; of the pious al-Aqta' al-Maghrabi; of the Koran
reader Warsh, and of Shayban al-Ra'i. But the venerable
shrines in the place are more than can properly be recorded
and numbered, and we have but mentioned those we were
able to see.
South of al-Qarafah is a plain known as the place of the
martyrs' tombs. There he those who were martyred with
Sariyah - may God hold them in His favour; this plain appears
to the eye to be covered with mounds like the mounds of
graves that have no monuments over them.
Al-Qarafah is remarkable for being all built with mosques
and inhabited shrines in which lodge strangers, learned men,
the good and the poor. The subsidy for each place comes
monthly from the Sultan; and likewise is it for the theological
colleges [mudaris] in Misr and Cairo. We were assured that
the cost of all this exceeds two thousand Egyptian dinars,
or four thousand mu'rnini, a month. It was told us that the
mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As has a daily income of about
thirty Egyptian dinars, which is spent on benefits connected
with it and the stipends of its officials, custodians, imams, and
readers.
Amongst the things we saw in Cairo, were four congregational
mosques21 superbly built and of beautiful design, as well
as many other mosques. In one of these congregational mosques
one day the preacher delivered the khutbah according to the
(orthodox) Sunni practice and included in it invocations for
the Companions of the Prophet-may God hold them in
His favour, for the followers of the Companions and others,
for the 'Mothers of the Faithful'22 wives of the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve them, and for his two noble uncles
Hamzah and al-' Abbas - may God hold them in His favour.
He discoursed so sweetly and gave so moving a sermon as to
humble the hardest heart and cause the tearless eye to flow.
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 63
He came to the khutbah dressed, in black according to the
'Abbaside usage.23 His costume was a black burdah topped by
a taylasan2* of fine black cloth which in the Maghrib we call
ihram, and a black turban, and he was girded with a sword.
When he had ascended the pulpit, at the first step, he struck it
with the end of his scabbard a blow which those present heard
as it were a call to silence. He did it again when halfway up,
and a third time at the end of his climb. He then saluted the
congregation right and left, standing between two black banners,
white-checkered, that were planted at the top of the
pulpit. His invocations on that day were to the 'Abbaside Imam,
Abu al-'Abbas Ahmad al-Nasir li din Hah ibn al-imam Abu
Muhammad al-Hasan al-Mustadi' billah ibn al-Imam Abu '1-
MuzafFar Yusuf al-Mustanjid billah, and then to the reviver of
his dynasty,26 Abu l-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub Salah al-Din
[Saladin], and then to the Sultan's brother and heir to the
throne, AbuBakr Sayf al-Din [Safadin].
We also looked upon the building of the citadel, an
impregnable fortress adjoining Cairo which the Sultan thinks
to take as his residence, extending its walls until it enfolds the
two cities of Misr and Cairo. The forced labourers on this construction,
and those executing all the skilled services and vast
preparations such as sawing the marble, cutting the huge stones,
and digging the fosse that girdles the walls noted above - a
fosse hollowed out with pick-axes from the rock to be a
wonder amongst wonders of which trace may remain - were
the foreign Rumi prisoners whose numbers were beyond computation.
There was no cause for any but them to labour on
this construction. The Sultan has constructions in progress in
other places and on these too the foreigners are engaged so
that those of the Muslims who might have been used in this
public work are relieved of it all, no work of that nature falling
on any of them.
Another of the things we saw, doing honour to the Sultan,
was the maristan [hospital] in the city of Cairo. It is a palace,
goodly for its beauty and spaciousness. This benefaction he
d\ THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
made so that he might deserve a heavenly reward, and to
acquire merit. He appointed as intendant a man of science with
whom he placed a store of drugs and whom he empowered
to use the potions and apply them in their various forms. In
the rooms of this palace were placed beds, fully appointed, for
lying patients. At the disposal of the intendant are servants
whose duty it is, morning and evening, to examine the conditions
of the sick, and to bring them the food and potions
that befit them.
Facing this establishment is another specially for women,
and they also have persons to attend them. A third which
adjoins them, a large place, has rooms with iron windows, and
it has been taken as a place of confinement for the insane.
They also have persons who daily examine their condition and
give them what is fitting for them. All these matters the Sultan
oversees, examining and questioning, and demanding the
greatest care and attention to them. In Misr there is another
hospital of precisely the same model.
Between Misr and Cairo is the great mosque which takes
its name from Abu '1-'Abbas Ahmad ibn Tulun. It is one of
the old congregational mosques, of elegant architecture, and
of large proportions. The Sultan made it a retreat for the
strangers from the Maghrib [Western part of Barbary and
Spain], where they might Eve and receive lectures; and for
their support he granted a monthly allowance. A curious thing,
told us by one of their prominent men, was that the Sultan
had entrusted to them their own management, and allows no
other hand over them. They themselves produce their own
leader, whose orders they obey and to whom they appeal in
sudden contingency. They live in peace and satisfaction, devoted
exclusively to the worship of their Lord, and finding, in the
favour of the Sultan, the greatest help to the good on whose
path they are set.
There is no congregational or ordinary mosque, no mausoleum
built over a grave, nor hospital, nor theological college,
where the bounty of the Sultan does not extend to all who
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 65
seek shelter or live in them. He is helped in this by grants from
the public treasury.
Amongst the beneficent acts that proclaim his care for all the
affairs of the Muslims was his ordering the building of a school
which he assigned to those preachers of the Book of Great and
Glorious God who teach exclusively the children of the poor
and orphans. For their needs he grants an adequate allowance.
Another of the Sultan's benefactions, and a monument of
enduring usefulness to Muslims, are the bridges he has begun to
construct seven miles west of Misr at the end of a causeway
that begins at high-Nile beside Misr. This causeway is like a
mountain stretched along the ground, over which it runs for
a distance of six miles until it reaches the aforesaid bridges.
These have about forty arches of the biggest type used in
bridges, and reach the desert which extends from them to
Alexandria. It is one of the most excellent measures taken by a
prudent king in readiness against any sudden onslaught by an
enemy coming through the breach of Alexandria at the time
of the Nile's overflow, when the countryside is in flood and the
passage of soldiers thereby prevented. He prepared this as a
passage-way for any time it may be needed. May God by His
favour avert from the lands of the Muslims all apprehension
and danger. To the Egyptians, the construction of these bridges
is a warning of a coming event, for they see in it an augury
that the Almohades26 will conquer it and the eastern regions.
But God is the Knower of His hidden affairs. There is no
God but He.
Near to these new bridges are the ancient pyramids, of miraculous
construction and wonderful to look upon, four-sided,
like huge pavilions rearing into the skies; two in particular
choke the firmament. The length of one of them from one
angle to another is three hundred and sixty-six paces. They
have been built with immense hewn rocks, arranged above
each other in an awesome fashion and wonderfully joined
having nothing between them that (like cement) would serve
to bind them. Their tips seem to the eye to be pointed, but it
(,(, THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
may be that the ascent to them is possible with clanger and
difficulty, and that their pointed tops may be found to be broad
and level. If men sought to tear them down they must fail.
There is dispute concerning them, some saying that they are
the tombs of 'Ad and his sons; others have different views.
To be short, none but Great and Glorious God can know
their story.
One of the two large pyramids has a door, up to which
one climbs a qamah or more from the ground, and through
which entry is made to a large chamber about fifty spans wide
and about the same in length. Inside that chamber is a long
hollow block of marble resembling what is commonly called
al bilah [the pillar], and which is said to be a tomb. God best
knows the truth of this. Below the large pyramid is another
which from one angle to another measures one hundred and
forty paces. Below this smaller pyramid are five smaller ones,
three contiguous and two nearby and connected.
Near to these pyramids at about a bow-shot's distance, is
a strange figure of stone [the Sphinx] rising up like a minaret
in the form of a man of fearsome aspect. Its face is to the pyramids
and it has its back to the qiblah where the Nile falls and
(is called) Abu '1-Ahwal [the Father of Dread].*
In the city of Misr is a congregational mosque named after
'Amr ibn al-'As-may God hold him in His favour-who
has also another mosque in Alexandria which is the Friday
place of worship for the Malikites [a sect of the orthodox
Sunni Muslims]. In Misr too are the remains of the destruction
caused by the fire that occurred during the revolution at the
time of the break-up of the 'Ubaydin [Fatimid] dynasty in the
year 564 [1169]. Most of the city has been restored, and buildings
now adjoin each other without intermission. It is a large
city, and the ancient relics to be seen in and about it attest
the size of its former boundaries.
*Ibn Jubayr is uncharacteristically careless in his description of the pyramids.
For example there are six not five smaller pyramids, and the Sphinx faces the
Nile not the pyramids.
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) 67
On the west bank of the Nile, which runs between the two
(cities), is a large and important burgh with fine buildings
called al-Jizah [Gizeh]. Every Sunday it holds a large market
where many congregate. Between it and Misr is an island
[Roda] with fine houses and commanding belvederes, which
is a resort for entertainment and diversion. Between this island
and Misr is a canal from the Nile [the Grand Canal of Cairo,
now a street], which lies along its length about a mile and has
no outlet. On this island is a congregational mosque in which
the khutbah is delivered.
Beside this mosque is the Nilometer, which measures the
Nile's increase at the time of its yearly flooding. The beginning
is expected in the month of June, the maximum in August,
and the ending in the beginning of October. This measuring
instrument is a white octagonal column of marble set in a place
which confines the water as it flows into it. It is divided into
twenty-two cubits [a cubit=a little over 20 inches], subdivided
into twenty-four parts called 'fingers'. If the flood with them
reaches the point where the water submerges it nineteen cubits,
that, according to their thinking, would be the limit for giving
a good year, but the submersion is often deep throughout the
flood. The medium they consider to be seventeen cubits, which
they deem to be better than the excess described above.
The Sultan is entitled to a land-tax in Egypt when the overflow
is sixteen cubits and above. On this, he who daily watches
for the increase gives the good news. The increase on the
graduations of cubits, as described, is notified daily until the
full level is reached. If it should be less than sixteen cubits,
the Sultan will that year receive no tribute and no land-tax.27
We were told that in Gizeh is the tomb of Ka'b al-Ahbar -
may God hold him in His favour. On the highest point of
Gizeh are marble stones from which crocodiles have been
shaped, and it is said that because of them no crocodiles appear
on the banks of the Nile three miles above or below them.
God best knows the truth of this.
Another of the generous deeds of this Sultan close to God
68 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
Most High, and of the memorials he has left in happy remembrance
of him both in religion and in the world, was his
annulling of the customs duty imposed as a tax on pilgrims during
the 'Ubaydin [Fatimid] dynasty. The pilgrims had suffered
distress from its harsh exactment and were much wasted by it,
and felt wronged by this humbling and crushing device. At
times there came some who had with them no more than the
bare cost of the journey, or had not even this provision, but
they were compelled to pay the fixed tax, which was seven
and a half Egyptian dinars, or fifteen mu'mini dinars, a head.
Those who could not suffered the most painful punishment at
'Aydhab, which city is like its name without the 'y'. [Dropping
the 'y' in 'Aydhab gives 'adhab, meaning 'punishment'.] Among
the various inflictions devised was hanging by the testicles, or
such foul acts. May God protect us from the abuse of His
decrees.
At Jiddah there were similar tortures and worse for him who
had not paid the dues at 'Aydhab, and whose name had arrived
without bearing a mark as having paid. But this Sultan abolished
the accursed impost, and to fill its place, provided foods and
other things, allotting to this purpose the tribute of a certain
place and making certain that it all arrived in the Hejaz, since
the dues in question had been taken in the name of provisions
for Mecca and Medina-may God render them prosperous.
Thus did he make a most happy reform, hghtening the way of
the pilgrim, who had been abandoned, with no one to whom
he could turn. God, at the hands of this just Sultan, was sufficient
to deliver the Muslims from grievous case and a most
painful state. Thanks should follow to him from all who believe
that the pilgrimage to the sacred mosque (in Mecca) is one of
the five fundamental pillars of Islam; until (his name) shall be
spread throughout all lands; and in all countries and all regions
prayers should be offered up for him. God who rewards all
who do good, and whose power is great, will not fail to reward
one who wrought so worthily.
Such was the impost in the lands of Egypt, besides the other
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (578) .69
taxes on everything bought and sold, great or small, to the
point of paying tax for drinking the Nile water, and other
things besides. This infamous exaction the Sultan abolished,
and spread justice and enlarged security. Indeed, such is his
justice, and the safety he has brought to his high-roads that
men in his lands can go about their affairs by night and from
its darkness apprehend no awe that should deter them. Such
were the affairs of men that we saw in Misr and Alexandria
as described above.
The Month of Muharram of the Year S79
[26th of April-25th of May, 1183]
May God let us know His grace and favour
THE new moon rose on the night of Tuesday the 26th of
April while we were in Cairo. May God prosper us in our
aims. On the morning of Sunday the 6th of Muharram we
left Misr and ascended the Nile towards upper Egypt, making
for Qus. May God, by His favour, grant us His habitual succour
and generous relief. The day on which, with the help of Great
and Glorious God, we sailed, fell on the first day of May.
Villages and large cities followed continuously along the banks
of the Nile, as we shall presently relate.
One of these villages is Askun, which lies on the eastern
bank of the Nile and to the left of him who ascends it. It is
said that here was born Moses the Interlocutor28 - the blessings
of God on our Prophet and on him - and here, as it is said,
his mother cast him upon the waters of the Nile. On the day
of our sailing, and that following, we observed, to the west
of the Nile and on our right, the ancient city of Joseph the
Truthful-God bless and preserve him-where is the prison
in which he was confined [Gen. xxxix. 20], which is now
being demolished and its stones removed to the citadel being
built at Cairo; a strong and impregnable fortress. In this city
are the store-houses in which Joseph - may God bless and preserve
him-stored the food [Gen. xli. 35]. They are hollow,
it is said. From there we moved to a place called Munyat ibn
al-Khasib, a large town on the bank of the Nile, to the right
of him who ascends it, with markets, baths, and all the conveniences
of a town. We passed it on the night of Sunday the
13 th of Muharram, the eighth day after our sailing from Cairo,
for the wind had fallen and we had been fain to stop on our
way. Now were we to describe every place we happened upon
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (579) 71
on the banks of the Nile, right and left; our book would be
cramped by it. We therefore intend to include only the larger
and more famous places.
Near to Munyat and to our left we came upon the blessed
mosque dedicated to Abraham the friend of the All-Merciful
- God's blessings upon him and upon our Prophet. This mosque
is celebrated and known for the benedictions it brings on those
who visit it. In its court are said to be the foot-prints of the beast
ridden by al-Khalil [the friend (of God)] - may God bless and
preserve him. Beyond that, to the left, is a place called Ansina,
a spacious and handsome village with ancient monuments. In
past times it was (already) an ancient city, having ancient walls.
Saladin destroyed them and imposed on all ships descending
the Nile the task of carrying one stone to Cairo. They have
now all been moved.
On the morning of Monday the 14th of Muharram, the
ninth day after our sailing from Misr, we passed a mountain
called Jabal al-Maqlah, on the eastern bank of the Nile, to our
left. This mountain is halfway to Qus from Misr being thirteen
post-stages [barid] from both.
"What must be mentioned for its remarkableness is that, starting
from the district of Misr, there lies along the east bank of
the Nile, to the left of him who ascends, a continuous and
ancient wall, some of which has been destroyed and some of
which remains, which continues along that bank to Uswan at
the end of Sa'id [Upper Egypt]. Between Uswan and Qus
are eight post-stages. The stories concerning this wall are varied
and contradictory, but to be short, it is a wonderful thing and
its secret is known only to Great and Glorious God. It is known
as The Wall of the old Woman. She has a story, and I think is
the sorceress mentioned in the book al-Masalik wa 'l-Mamalik30
[Routes and Countries] who reigned here for a time.
A note to repair an oversight
When we landed at Alexandria in the month mentioned
[Dhu '1-Qa'dah], the first thing we saw was a large concourse
72 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of people come forth to gaze upon Rumi prisoners being
brought to the town on camels, facing the tails and surrounded
by timbal and horn. We asked of their story, and were told
a case that would rend the heart in compassion and pity. A
number of Syrian Christians had assembled and built ships in
that part of their land which is nearest to the Sea of al-Qulzum
[Red Sea], and had then moved their various parts on camels
belonging to neighbouring Arabs at a price they had agreed
upon with them. On arrival at the shores of the Sea, they had
nailed their ships together, completed their construction, set
them in order, and launched them into the sea.
They had then sailed forth to harass (Muslim) pilgrims.81
Coming to the Sea of al-Na'am,32 they there burnt some sixteen
ships, and then went on to 'Aydhab where they caught
a ship coming with pilgrims from Jiddah. On the land they
seized a large caravan journeying from Qus to 'Aydhab and
killed all in it, leaving none alive. They captured two ships
bringing merchandise from the Yemen, and burnt many foods
prepared on the beaches as provisions for Mecca and Medina -
God exalt them. Many infamous acts they committed, such as
are unheard of in Islam, for no Rumi had ever before come to
that place. The worst, which shocks the ears for its impiousness
and profanity, was their aim to enter the City of the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and remove him
from the sacred tomb.
This intent they spread abroad, and let report of it run on
their tongues. But God brought punishment upon them for
their audacity, and for embarking on that which Providence
has forbidden. They were no more than a day's journey from
Medina, when God repelled their hostile purpose with ships
prepared in Misr and Alexandria, and in which were the
chamberlain known as Lu'lu' [Husam al-Din Lu'lu'] and some
valorous Moorish sailors. They pursued the enemy who had
been near to escape, and seized them all. It was one of the signs
of Ail-Powerful God's solicitude. They had overtaken them
after a long time, for there had been more than a month and
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (579) 73
a half or thereabouts between them. The enemy were killed
or taken prisoner. The prisoners were distributed amongst
various countries to be put to death in them, and some were
sent to Mecca and Medina. God, with His beneficent works,
is sufficient to Islam and the Muslims in this grave tide. Praise
be to God, Lord of the Universe.
The account is resumed
Amongst the places we passed in Upper Egypt after Jabal
al-Maqlah which, as we have already related, was halfway from
Misr to Qus, was a place called Manfalut, near to the west
bank of the Nile, to the right of him. who ascends it. It has
markets and all that is needed of commodities, which are of
the highest quality and without rival in Upper Egypt. Its
wheat is taken to Misr for its goodness and the heaviness of its
grain. Indeed it has become renowned because of this, and
merchants ascend the Nile in ships to fetch this wheat.
After Manfalut comes the city of Usyut [Lycopolis], a famous
city of Upper Egypt about three miles distant from the west
bank of the Nile. It has a pleasing aspect, and is surrounded
by gardens of the date-palm. Its walls are old. Below it is a
place called Abu Tij [Abotis], a town on the west bank of
the Nile having markets and all the conveniences of a town.
Then comes the city of Ikhmim [Chemmis or Panapolis],
another of the famous cities of Upper Egypt, to the east of
the Nile and on its bank. It is of ancient foundation and a longstanding
site. Here is the mosque of Dhu '1-Nun the Egyptian,
and that of Daud [David], one of the saints famed for good
works and continence. They are both mosques impressed with
the character of blessedness, and we entered them, to be blessed
by praying in them, on Saturday the 19th of Muharram. In
this city are monuments and constructions built by the Copts
and churches attended till to-day by the Christian Copt clients.
The most remarkable of the temples of the world talked of
for their wonder is the great temple east of the city and below
74 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
its walls.33 Its length is two hundred and twenty cubits, and
its breadth one hundred and sixty. The people of these parts
know it as birba, and thus too are known all their temples and
ancient constructions. This great temple is supported by forty
columns, beside its walls, the circumference of each column
being fifty spans and the distance between them thirty spans.
Their capitals are of great size and perfection, cut in an unwonted
fashion and angulated in ornate style as if done by turners.
The whole is embellished with many colours, lapis lazuli and
others. The columns are carved in low relief from top to
bottom. Over the capital of each column and stretching to its
neighbour is a great slab of carved stone, the biggest of which
we measured and found to be fifty-six spans in length, ten in
width, and eight in depth.
The ceiling of this temple is wholly formed of slabs of stone
so wonderfully joined as to seem to be one single piece; and
over it all are disposed rare paintings and uncommon colours,
so that the beholder conceives the roof to be of carved wood.
Each slab has a different painting. Some are adorned with
comely pictures of birds with outstretched wings making the
beholder believe they are about to fly away; others are embellished
with images of men, very beautiful to look upon and
of elegant form, each image having a distinctive shape, for
example holding a statuette or a weapon, or a bird, or a chalice,
or making sign to another with the hand, together with other
forms it would take too long to describe and -which -words are
not adequate to express.
Within and without this great temple, both in its upper and
its lower parts, are pictures all of varied form and description.
Some are of dreadful, inhuman forms that terrify the beholder
and fill him with wonder and amazement. There was hardly
the space of an awl or needle-hole which did not have an image
or engraving or some hieroglyphic writing that is not understood.
This remarkable decoration which can be wrought from
hard stone where it cannot be worked in soft wood, covers
the whole of this vast and splendid temple, in wonder at which
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (579) 75
the beholder might conceive that all time spent in its adornment,
embellishment, and beautifying would be too short.
Glory to the Creator of wondrous things. There is no God but
He.
In the heights of the temple is the ceiling, spread with the
great slabs of stone in the fashion we have described. The ceiling
is of great height, so that the fancy is bewildered and the
mind perplexed in thinking how the stones were raised and
set in place.
Within the temple are chambers, chapels, entries and exits,
ascents and stairs, conduits and passages, where groups of men
could be lost, and never find each other except by high calls.
Its walls are eighteen spans in width, and all its stones are finely
joined in the manner we have described. In a word, this temple
has a sublime grandeur, and its sight is one of the wonders of
the world, beyond description or defining, although we have
given an indication, with a fragment of its description, that
will tell something of it. God embraces all knowledge of it,
and knows its meaning. The reader of this book should not
think our account of it is magnified, for any relater, be he a
Quss or a Sahban,34 would find himself deficient and inadequate.
God embraces all knowledge. There is no God but He.
In the towns of this Upper Egypt passed on their way by
pilgrims and travellers, such as Ikhmim, Qus, and Munyat ibn
al-Khasib, the stopping of travellers' ships and their search and
examination, the plunging of hands into the clothing of the
merchants in search of what dirhams and dinars they might
have under their arm-pits or in their bosoms, is abominable to
hear, and hateful to relate. All was done by way of collecting
zakat, without following the principle of possession for a complete
year, or observing whether the goods reached the taxable
level [two hundred dirhams in value in the case of merchandise],
as we related in the description in this book of Alexandria.
They sometimes made them give oath as to what they had
and whether they had anything else (not seen), bringing forth
God's Holy Book for them to swear upon. Amongst these
76 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
tax-receivers the pilgrims stand in shame and abasement, being
reminded of the days in the customs (at Alexandria). This state
of things, there is no doubt, Saladin has no knowledge of. Did
he but know, he would end it, even as he decreed the end of
graver things, and fight them as a religious duty, for such it
would be in view of their oppression, their exaction of painful
duties, and their unjust conduct to strangers devoted to Great
and Glorious God who go forth from their native land to the
sanctuary of his Haram. Such a step, God willing, would lead
to the payment of the zakat in very good face by the owners
of merchandise, provided of course that a year of possession
had passed, and would prevent the interference with strangers
cut off from their homes, and to whom the zakat should be
given and not taken away. And it would protect the honour
of the just Sultan, whose justice fills the land and whose fame
has spread through many countries, and injure not the repute
of one to whom God has given good repute, nor shame the
report of one to whom He has given good report.
One of the most infamous things we saw was a group of
insolent exactors, carrying in their hands long, pointed prods
with handles, going aboard the ships to examine what was in
them. There was no bundle or sack into which they did not
drive those accursed staves in case there should be in the baggage,
which held nothing but provisions, some unseen goods
or money. This is the most shamefully affecting of the odious
happenings. God has forbidden spying [Koran XLIX, 12: 'Do
not spy, nor let some of you backbite others']. What then of
the exposure of that which requires a decent veiling, its owner
not wishing it be gazed upon, from modesty or because it is
precious to him, not from cupidity, but for some need. May
God punish these oppressors at the hand of the just Sultan and
if He wills, favour His success.
Amongst the places that we passed after Ikhmim was one
called Manshat al-Sudan [ancient Ptolemais Hermiu] on the
west bank of the Nile. It is a populous village and is said to
once have been a large city. In front of this village, between
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (579) 77
it and the Nile, has been erected a high embankment of stones,
like a town-wall, against which the Nile laps but does not, in
its flood and rising, overtop. The village is thus safe from the
river's intrusion. Below it is a place known as al-Bulyanah,
a pleasant village with many palm trees on the western bank
of the Nile, and distant from Qus four post-stages. Then comes
a place called Dashnah on the east bank; a walled city with all
the conveniences of a city. Between it and Qus are two poststages.
We came next to a place on the west bank of the Nile and
close to it, called Dandarah [Tentyras], a city of Upper Egypt.
It has many palm-trees, has a pleasant aspect, and is famed for
its fresh dates. We were told that it has a great temple, known
to the people of these parts as birba as we explained in our
description of Ikhmim and its temple. It is reported that the
temple of Dandarah is even more magnificent and larger too
than that.
From there we moved to the city of Qina [Caenepolis], also
a town of Upper Egypt, white, fair to look upon, and having
splendid buildings. Amongst its praiseworthy qualities is the
modesty of its women, who keep to their houses so that a
woman is never seen in the street in any circumstance. The
stories concerning them verify this; and the women of Dashnah
mentioned above are like them in it. Qina is on the east bank
of the Nile, and about one post-stage from Qus. Below it is
Qift [Koptos], a city to the east of the Nile, and three miles
from its bank. It is one of the aforementioned towns of Upper
Egypt, handsome, with clean buildings, and of finished construction.
Then, on Thursday the 24th of Muharram, the 19th of May,
came our arrival at Qus [Apollinopolis]. We had been on the
Nile eighteen days, and we entered Qus on the nineteenth.
This is a city of fine markets, and of ample amenities, and it
has many beings in it because of the comings and goings of
pilgrims and of merchants from India, the Yemen, and Ethiopia.
It is a place which all may come upon, a place of alighting for
78 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
the traveller, a gathering place for companies of wayfarers, and
a meeting-place for pilgrims from the Maghrib, from Misr,
from Alexandria and from adjoining lands. From here they go
into the desert of 'Aydhab, and here they return on their way
back from the Hajj. "We lodged at an inn called ibn al-'Ajami
in Munyah, a large suburb outside the city and facing door of
this inn.
The Month of Safar (579)
[26th of May-23rd of June, 1183]
May God accord us His grace and favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Wednesday,
the 25th of May, while we were yet in Qus and wishful
of setting forth to 'Aydhab36 - may God in His grace and favour,
help us in our aims. On Monday the 13th of the month, which
was the 6th of June, we took out all our baggage, provisions,
and the rest, to al-Mabraz, a place in the direction of the qiblah
and near to the city. It is a large space surrounded by palmtrees
where the baggage of the pilgrims and merchants is collected
and loaded. From here they set forth on their journey,
and here is weighed that which the camel-masters must know
the weight of. And so, when the evening prayers were over,
we departed thence, and came to a waterpoint called al-Hajir
where we passed the night. The day of Tuesday we tarried
there because of the absence of some of the camel-masters at
their houses which were nigh at hand. That night, the night of
Wednesday, the 15th of the month (of Safar), while we were
still in Hajir, the moon suffered a full eclipse, which began at
the beginning of the night, and continued for a part of it. On
the morning of Wednesday we set forth, and took our midday
rest at a place called Qila' al-Diya'. The night we spent
in a place called Mahatt al-Laqitah. This had all been through
the desert in which there was no sign of cultivation.
Early on Thursday we halted at a watering place called
al-'Abdayn [The Two Slaves]. It is related that they died of
thirst before they could reach it. The place was named after
them, and here is their tomb. God's mercy upon them. We
drew water for three days and left with the dawn on Friday
the 17th of the month. We journeyed on through the desert
encamping in it whenever night darkened upon us, while the
80 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
caravans of'Aydhab and Qus came and went so that the desert
was animated and safe. On Monday the 20th of the month we
alighted at a watering place called Dinqash, a spring to which
come animals and men of a number which none but Great
and Glorious God can count.
Across this desert no one will journey save on camel, by
reason of their endurance of thirst. The best and most comfortable
camel litters used on them are the shaqadif, and the best
of these are those made in the Yemen for, like the travelling
ashakin [seats] they are covered with leather and are roomy.
Two of them are bound together by stout ropes and put across
the camel. They have supports at each corner, and on these
rests a canopy. The traveller and his companion in counterpoise
will thus be veiled from the blaze of the midday heat
and may sit reclining and at ease beneath its covering. With
his companion he may partake of what he needs of food and
the like, or read, when he wishes, the Koran or a book; and
whoso deems it lawful to play chess may, if he wish, play his
companion, for diversion and to relieve the spirit. To be short,
it eases the hardship of travel. Most travellers ride their camels
on top of their baggage and so painfully endure the rigours
of the burning heat.
At this spring of Dinqash, because of the press around the
water, there arose a quarrel between some of the Arab camelmasters
from Yemen - they were Bah, a sub-tribe of the
Quda'ah, who held the contract for providing transport on
the road to 'Aydhab - and some Ghuzz [a local Turkish tribe].
This all but became a riot, but God prevented it.
The way to 'Aydhab from Qus is by two roads. One is that
known as the road of the Two Slaves, and is the one we followed
and the more direct. The other is by Uswan,36 a village
on the banks of the Nile. The confluence of these two roads
is near to the spring of Dinqash. They have another meeting
place at a waterpoint called Shaghib, one day ahead of the
spring of Dinqash.
At eventide on Monday, we provisioned ourselves with
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (579) 81
water for a day and a night and removed to water in a place
called Shaghib, reaching it early on the morning of Wednesday
the 22nd of Safar. This water comes from a hole dug in
the ground and flows bountifully at little depth, but is brackish.
After providing ourselves with water for three days, we moved
on from it at dawn on Thursday, towards water at a place
called Amtan. We left the water-track at a place called * * * *,
to our left, with no more than a day's journey between it and
Shaghib, but the road is difficult for camels. In the early forenoon
of Sunday the 26th of Safar we dismounted at Amtan.
And on this day I completed my learning by heart the Book
of Great and Glorious God. Praise and thanks to Him for
helping us in this.
The water of Amtan is in a spring which God has blessed
in particular, for its water is the best and sweetest of the way.
Water buckets beyond counting will be found there, and there
will water the many caravans that descend upon it, with the
camels so far gone in thirst that were they brought to a river
they would exhaust it and dry it up. We wished to count the
caravans that came and went upon this road but could not (for
their number), especially those from 'Aydhab bearing the merchandise
of India that came through the Yemen to 'Aydhab.
The greater part of this was the loads of pepper, so numerous
as to seem to our fancy to equal in quantity only the dust.
A curious circumstance that we observed in this desert is that
you will discover loads of pepper, cinnamon, and the like
thrown unguarded by the side of the road.37 They are left on
the road like this through the sickness of the camels that bear
them, or for some other reason, and remain thus in their place
until their owners remove them, secure from all risk despite
the number of men of all kinds who pass beside them.
We left Amtan on the morning of Monday, following the
Sunday described, and at midday alighted by the water of a
place called Mujaj nigh to the road. We took from it four
days' water to bring us to al-'Ushara', a day distant from
'Aydhab. From this station of Mujaj the road leads through
82 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
al-Wadah, a sandy and toilsome stretch that reaches to the
shores of the Jiddah sea. Through this stretch the march continues,
if God wills, to 'Aydhab, and lies in a wide plain over
which the eyes, right and left, can range.
At midday on Thursday the 28th of the month, we departed
from Mujaj and took our way to al-Wadah.
The Month of Rabi( al-Awwal (S79)
[24th of June-23rd of July, 1183]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Friday,
the 24th of the month of June, when we were at the end
of al-Wadah and about three stages from 'Aydhab; and on the
morning of Friday we halted at the waters of 'Ushara', two
stages from 'Aydhab. In this place are many 'ushar plants
[Asclepias gigantea], which are like the utrujj [Citrus cedra],3* but
have no spines. The water of this place is not especially sweet;
it is in an uncased well, and we found that the sand had fallen
into it and covered the water. The camel-masters sought to
dig it that they might bring forth water, but failed, so that the
caravan remained without it. We marched that night, the night
of Saturday the 2nd of the month, and after sunrise we encamped
at the waters of al-Khubayb, within sight of 'Aydhab.
Here both the caravans and the people of the country take
water, which suffices for them all, for the well is large, like a
huge cistern.
On the evening of Saturday, we entered 'Aydhab, a city on
the shores of the Jiddah sea. It has no walls and most of its
houses are booths of reeds. It has now, however, some houses,
newly-built, of plaster. It is one of the most frequented ports
of the world, because of the ships of India and the Yemen that
sail to and from it, as well as the pilgrim ships that come and
go. It is in the desert, with no vegetation and nothing to eat
save what is brought to it. Yet its people, by reason of the
pilgrims, enjoy many benefits, especially at the time of dieir
passing through, since for each load of victuals that the pilgrims
bring, they receive a fixed food tax, light in comparison
with the former customs duties which, as we said, have been
raised by Saladin. A further advantage they gain from the
84 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
pilgrims is in the hiring of their jilab: ships which bring them
much profit in conveying the pilgrims to Jiddah and returning
them when dispersing after the discharge of their pious
duty. There are no people of easy circumstances in 'Aydhab
but have zjilabah or two which bring them an ample livelihood.
Glory to God who apportions sustenance to all in divers
forms. There is no God but He.
We took lodging there in a house named after Munih, one
of its Ethiopean leading men who had become established there
with houses, spring-encampments, and jilab.
In the sea of 'Aydhab and near to the city are some islands
where there are pearl-fisheries. The season for diving is the
time at which we write these words, which is the foreign
month of June, and the month which follows, and they extract
precious pearls of great value. The divers go out to these islands
in small boats [zawariq] and stay in them some days and then
return with what God has meted out to each according to his
lot. The catch is not deep, and they bring it out in double
sea-shells (whose flesh is) like a kind of fish resembling somewhat
the sea-turtle. When they are split, the insides of the two
valves show as silver shells. They are then opened and inside
them is found the core of the pearl covered by the fleshy part
of the sea-shell, and these they gather according to their fortune.
Glory be to God who so determines. There is no God
but He. But they (live) in a country which has no (produce)
fresh or dry, and live therein the lives of beasts. Glory to Him
who makes dear a country to its people, but indeed these folk
are closer to wild beasts than they are to men.
The journey from Jiddah to 'Aydhab is most calamitous for
pilgrims, save those few of them whom Great and Glorious
God preserves, for the wind takes most of them to anchorages
on the desert far to the south of 'Aydhab. There the Bujat,
a type of Sudanese living in the mountains, come down to
them and hire them their camels, and lead them through a
waterless track. Often the greater number of them perish from
thirst, and the Bujat seize* the money and other things that they
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (579) 85
have left behind. Not seldom, pilgrims will stray on foot through
the wayless desert and, being lost, die of thirst. Those who survive
and reach 'Aydhab are like men quickened from the
shroud. While we were there we saw some who had come
in this manner, and in their ghastly shape and changed form
was 'a portent for those who observed carefully' [Koran XV,
75]. Most of the deaths of the pilgrims took place at these
anchorages; some were helped by the wind to the port of
'Aydhab but they were few.
The jilab that ply on this Pharaonic sea are sewn together,
no nails at all being used on them. They are sewn with cord
made from qinbar, which is the fibre of the coconut and which
the makers thrash until it takes the form of thread, which then
they twist into a cord with which they sew the ships. These
they then caulk with shavings of the wood of palm-trees. When
they have finished making ajilabah in this fashion, they smear
it with grease, or castor oil, or the oil of the qirsh [shark], which
is best. This qirsh is a huge fish which swallows drowning men.
Their purpose in greasing the boat is to soften and supple it
against the many reefs that are met with in that sea, and because
of which nailed ships do not sail through it. The wood for
these parts is brought from India and the Yemen, as is the
coconut fibre. A singular feature of these jilab is that their sails
are woven from the leaves of the muql tree [Theban palm or
Bdelhum, a kind of gum-tree], and their parts are conformably
weak and unsound in structure. Glory to God who contrives
them in this fashion and who entrusts men to them.
There is no God but He.
The people of 'Aydhab use the pilgrims most wrongfully.
They load the jilab with them until they sit one on top of the
other so that they are like chickens crammed in a coop. To
this they are prompted by avarice, wanting the hire. The
owner of the craft will exact its full cost from the pilgrims for
a single journey, caring not what the sea may do with it after
that, saying, 'Ours to produce the ships: the pilgrims' to protect
their lives.' This is a common saying amongst them.
E
86 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
This is the country of Islam most deserving a hisbah,39 and
the scourge employed should be the sword. The best for him
who can is not to see it, and to take his way by Syria to 'Iraq
and join there with the Emir of the Baghdad pilgrimage. If
this is impossible for him when going to Mecca, he should
then, at the dispersion of the pilgrimage, go with that Emir
al-Hajj to Baghdad and thence to Acre. Thence, as he pleases,
he may go to Alexandria, or Sicily, or elsewhere. He may even
find a Rumi ship sailing to Ceuta or another Muslim land.
And should he find this circling road to be too long, it will be
easy in comparison with what he would meet with at 'Aydhab
and places like it.
The people of 'Aydhab belong to a tribe of Sudanese called
al-Bujat. Their Sultan is one of their kind, and Eves with them
in the mountains near the city. He will, on occasion, come to
meet with the Wali [Governor] of the Ghuzz there, in order
to display his obedience. He is appointed the Wali's deputy in
the country and all the revenues, save for a small part, go to
him. This race from the Sudan is more astray from the (right)
path, and have less reason, than the animals. They have no
religion save the formal words professing the unity of God,
which they utter to display that they are Muslims. But behind
that are corrupt beliefs and practices that cannot be condoned
and are unlawful. Their men and women go naked abroad,
wearing nothing but the rag which covers their genitals, and
most not even this. In a word, they are a breed of no regard
and it is no sin to pour maledictions upon them.
On Monday the 25th of Rabi' al-Awwal, the 18th of July,
we embarked on a jilabah to cross to Jiddah. We waited that
day at anchor because of the stillness of the wind and the
absence of the nawati [Gr. VCCHTCCI, 'sailors']. But with the
morning of Tuesday, we sailed with the favour of Great and
Glorious God and in the hope of His gracious aid. Our stay
in 'Aydhab, not including the Monday now mentioned, had
been three and twenty days, of which God, Great and Glorious
is He, will hold count for us because of our adversities and ill-
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (579) 87
condition and for the ravages on our health from want of proper
food. It is enough for you of a place where everything is
imported, even water; and this (because of its bitterness) is less
agreeable than thirst. We had lived between air that melts the
body and water that turns the stomach from appetite for food.
He did no injustice to this town who sang,
'Brackish of water and flaming of air.'
A sojourn in it is the greatest snare on the road to the Ancient
House [the Ka'bah] - may God magnify it in esteem and
veneration, and enlarge the (heavenly) reward of the pilgrims
for what they have endured, more especially in that accursed
town. Men tell stories of its abominations, even saying that
Solomon the son of David - on our Prophet and on him be
peace - took it as a prison for the Ufrit [afrite or demon, mentioned
in the Koran XXVII, 39]. May God relieve the pilgrims
of it by furnishing the straight road to the Sacred House, which
is from Misr by 'Aqabah of Ailah [Elim] to holy Medina.
This is the shortest road, with the sea to the right and the
venerable Jabal Tur (Mount Sinai) to the left. But the Franks
have near to it a garrisoned castle which prevents men from
passing it - may God by His favour grant victory to His faith
and glorify His word.
Our passage over the sea on Tuesday the 26th of Rabi'
al-Awwal, and the Wednesday following it, was long-lasting
because the wind was light. But at the end of the vespers of
the night of Thursday, when we had been rejoicing in the sight
of the birds from the Hejaz coast circling in the air, the lightning
flashed from the direction of that land, which was to the east.
Then rose a storm which darkened the skies and at last covered
them. The tempest raged and drove the ship from off its course
and backwards. The fury of the wind continued, and the darkness
thickened and filled the air so that we knew not which
way lay our course. Then a few stars appeared and gave us
some guidance. The sail was lowered to the bottom of the
daqal,*0 which is the mast, and we passed that night in a storm
88 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
which drove us to despair, seeing one of the famous storms of
the Pharaonic sea. Then with the morn God brought us relief
in our destitution * * * * the wind fell, the clouds dispersed,
and the skies cleared; and in the distance the lands of the Hejaz
appeared before us. We could see only its mountains east of
Jiddah, and the rubban of the ship, that is the captain, said that
between those mountains which we saw and the coast of Jiddah
lay two days' travel. May God by His power and favour help
us in every difficulty and aid us in every strait.
That day, Thursday, we sailed along under a good light
breeze and at eventide anchored at a small island in that sea,
near to the coast. We had met many reefs which had broken
the water and made it laugh, and we entered their windings
with care and caution. The rubban was shrewd in his art, and
skilled, and God delivered us from the reefs so that we anchored
at this island. Here we disembarked and passed the night of
Friday the 29th of Rabi' al-Awwal. The morning was calm,
but the wind blew from a direction unsuitable to us, so we
remained there all that Friday.
On Saturday the 30th a slight wind rose, and we sailed
quietly in a calm sea that seemed to the beholder to be a dish
of blue crystal. Thus we moved along, praying for the beneficent
works of Great and Glorious God. The name of this island
is 'Ayqat al-Sufun [the Obstacle of Ships], but Great and
Glorious God preserved us from the evil auguries of its unhappy
name. Praise and thanks to Him for that.
The Month of Rabi' al-Akhir (579)
[24th of July-2ist of August, 1183]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Saturday,
while we yet were at the aforementioned island, but its
crescent was not revealed to our eyes because of the storm.
The following night it was seen large and high in the sky,
so we confirmed its rising on the night of Saturday 23rd of
July.41 At eventide on Sunday the second we anchored at a
harbourage called Ubhur, a day's distance from Jiddah. The
position of this harbour is most uncommon, since a channel
of the sea penetrates the land, which encompasses it on both
sides, and ships can find therein a safe and tranquil anchorage.
At dawn on Monday, we sailed from this place, by the favour
of God Most High, under a light breeze - God is the disposer
of all things. There is no Lord but He.
When night fell we anchored near Jiddah, which was within
sight. The wind raged on the morning of the Tuesday that
followed, and stopped our. entering the port. The entry into
it is difficult to achieve because of the many reefs and the windings.
We observed the art of these captains and the mariners
in the handling of their ships through the reefs. It was truly
marvellous. They would enter the narrow channels and manage
their way through them as a cavalier manages a horse that
is light on the bridle and tractable. They came through in a
wonderful manner that cannot be described. At midday of
Tuesday the 4th of Rabi' al-Akhir, being the 26th of July, we
arrived at Jiddah, praising Great and Glorious God and thanking
Him for our safety and our deliverance from the tempest we
had faced those eight days of our voyage on the sea. From their
divers perils God in His goodness and favour had preserved us.
There had been the sudden crises of the sea, the perversity
90 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of the wind, the many reefs encountered, and the emergencies
that arose from the imperfections of the sailing gear which
time and again became entangled and broke when sails were
raised or lowered or an anchor raised. At times the bottom of
the jilabah would run against a reef when passing through them,
and we would listen to a rumbling that called us to abandon
hope. Many times we died and lived again - praise be to God
who, in His power and glory, bestowed on us His care, ensuring
our protection and sufficiency; praise fitting His kindness, and
in solicitation of His continuing favour. There is no God but He.
We lodged, in Jiddah, in the house of the governor Ah, who
ruled it in the name of the above mentioned42 Emir of Mecca.
"We were in one of those upper apartments built of palm-leaves
at the top of their houses. They go out from them on to the
roof to spend the night. On landing at Jiddah, happy in the
safety which- Great and Glorious God had granted us, we
earnestly beseeched Him that our return should not be by this
accursed sea unless some necessity arose preventing our going
by other ways - God in His power acts with beneficence in all
that He decrees and disposes.
This Jiddah is a village on the coast we have mentioned.
Most of its houses are of reeds, but it has inns built of stone
and mud, on the top of which are reed structures serving as
upper chambers, and having roofs where at night rest can be
had from the ravages of the heat. In this village are ancient
remains which show that it is old. Traces of the walls that
encompassed it remain to this day. In it is a place having an
ancient and lofty dome, which is said to have been the lodging
place of Eve, the mother of mankind - God's blessing upon
her - when on her way to Mecca. This edifice was erected to
illustrate its blessedness and excellence. God best knows concerning
it. The city has a blessed mosque attributed to 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab - may God hold him in His favour - and another
with two pillars of ebony wood, also attributed to him - may
God hold him in His favour - although some attribute it to
Harun al-Rashid - may God have mercy on him.
THE MONTH OF RABI* AL-AKHIR (579) 91
Most of the inhabitants of this town and. the surrounding
desert and mountain are Sharifs, 'Aliites, Hasanites, Husaynites
and Ja'farites - may God hold in His favour their noble ancestors.
They lead a life so wretched as to break the hardest stone
in compassion. They employ themselves in all manner of trades,
such as hiring camels should they possess any, and selling milk
or water and other things like dates which they might find,
or wood they might collect. Sometimes their women, the
Sharifahs themselves, would share in this work. Glory to the
Determiner in what He decrees. Beyond a peradventure they
are of a house to which God is pleased to give the life to come
and not this world; and He has made us amongst those who
it is proper should love the family of the Prophet, from whom
He has removed impurity and whom He has cleansed.
Outside the city are ancient constructions which attest the
antiquity of its foundation. It is said that it was a Persian city.
It has cisterns hewn from the hard rock, connected with each
other and beyond count for their number. They are both within
and without the town, and men say that there are three hundred
and sixty outside the town, and the same within. "We
indeed saw a great number, such as could not be counted. But
in truth the things of wonder are many. Glory to Him whose
knowledge encompasses them all.
The greater number of the people of these Hejaz and other
lands are sectaries and schismatics who have no religion, and
who have separated in various doctrines.43 They treat the pilgrims
in a manner in which they "do not treat the Christians
and Jews under tribute, seizing most of the provisions they have
collected, robbing them and finding cause to divest them of
all they have. The pilgrim in their lands does not cease to pay
dues and provide foods until God helps him to return to his
native land. Indeed, but for what God has done to mend the
affairs of Muslims in these parts by means of Saladin, they
would suffer the most grievous oppression, with no remission
of its rigours. For Saladin lifted from the pilgrim the customs
duty, and in its stead provided money and victuals with orders
92 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
that they should be sent to Mukthir, Emir of Mecca. But when
this consignment allotted to them was somewhat delayed, this
Emir returned to mtimidating the pilgrims and made show to
imprison them for the dues.
In this regard, it happened that when we arrived at Jiddah
the matter was under discussion with Mukthir, this Emir, and
we had been arrested. His order came that the pilgrims should
guarantee each other (for payment) and might then enter the
Haram [Holy Mosque] of God. Should the money and victuals
due for him from Saladin arrive it would be well; otherwise
he would not forego his dues from the pilgrims. Such was his
speech, as if God's Haram were an heirloom in his hand and
lawfully his to let to the pilgrims. Glory to God who alters
and changes laws.
That which Saladin had substituted for the pilgrim's customs
dues was two thousand dinars and two thousand and two irdabh
of wheat, which is about eight hundred qafiz in our Seville
measure, and this was exclusive of the land-rents granted to
them by this ordinance in Upper Egypt and in the Yemen.
And but for the absence of this just Sultan, Saladin, at the wars
against the Franks in Syria, these actions of the Emir against
the pilgrims would never have occurred.
The lands of God [i.e. Islamic lands] that most deserve to
be purified by the sword, and cleansed of their sins and impurities
by blood shed in holy war are these Hejaz lands, for what
they are about in loosening the ties of Islam, and dispossessing
the pilgrims of their property and shedding their blood. Those
of the Andalusian jurisprudents who believe that the pilgrims
should be absolved from this religion obligation believe rightly
for that reason, and for the way, unpleasing to Great and
Glorious God, in which the pilgrims are used. The traveller
by this way faces danger and oppression. Far otherwise has God
decreed the sharing in that place of His indulgence. How can
it be that the House of God should now be in the hands of
people who use it as an unlawful source of livelihood, making
it a means of illicitly claiming and seizing property, and detaining
THE MONTH OF RABI« AL-AKHIR (579) 93
the pilgrims on its account, thus bringing them to humbleness
and abject poverty. May God soon correct and purify this
place by relieving the Muslims of these destructive schismatics
with the swords of the Almohades, the defenders of the Faith,
God's confederates, possessing righteousness and truth, the protectors
of the Haram of Great and Glorious God, the abstainers
from what is unlawful, the zealous raisers of His name, the
proclaimers of His message and the upholders of His creed.
Truly He can do as He wishes. He is the best of Protectors,
the best of Helpers.
Let it be absolutely certain and beyond doubt established that
there is no Islam save in the Maghrib lands. There they follow
the clear path that has no separation and the like, such as there
are in these eastern lands of sects and heretical groups and
schisms, save those of them whom Great and Glorious God
has preserved from this. There is no justice, right, or religion
in His sight except with the Almohades - may God render
them powerful. They are the last just imams of this time, all
the other Kings of the day follow another path, taking tithes
from the Muslim merchants as if they were of the community
of the dhimmah, seizing their goods by every trick and pretext,
and following a course of oppression the like of which, oh my
God, has never been heard of. All of them, that is, except this
just Sultan, Saladin, whom we have mentioned for his conduct
and virtues. If he but had a helper in the cause of righteousness
* * * * of what I desire. May Great and Glorious God
mend the affairs of the Muslims with His beneficent attention
and kind works.
A singular circumstance that we observed in the matter of
the propagation of the Mu'min Almohade faith and the spreading
of its word in these lands, and the inclination of its people to
their dominance, is that most, indeed all their peoples, hint at
it covertly and even quite plainly. They relate this to certain
omens which fell to the notice of some of them and gave warning
of coming events which they saw in the result to be true.
Amongst the omens leading to this is the following. Between
94 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the mosque of ibn Tulum and Cairo are two old and closelybuilt
towers. On one is a statue facing the west, while on the
other there had been a statue looking to the east. They used
to relate that if one of them should fall, it would give warning
of conquest by the people in whose direction it faced over the
lands of Egypt, and others besides. By a strange conjuncture,
the falling of the statue facing the east was followed by the
victory of the Ghuzz [the Seljuk Turks under Saladin] over
the 'Ubaydin [Fatimid] power and their conquest of the territories
of Misr and other lands. They now expect the fall of
the statue facing west and the fulfilment of their hopes of being
governed by the people of the west [the Almohade rulers of
Spain]. Please God it may be so. There remains nothing but
the happy prospect of an Almohade conquest of these lands,
and attentively they watch for it one auspicious morning,
being certain of it, and expecting it as they expect the (last)
hour, the fulfilment of the promise of which no one feels
doubt.
In this regard, we learnt in Alexandria and Misr and other
places, both directly and by hearsay, of a strange circumstance
which indicated that this dear event is truly decreed by God
and that the claims concerning it are true. For it was told us
that some jurisprudents and leaders of these countries have prepared
an embellished discourse to be delivered before our lord
the Prince of the Faithful - may God exalt his state - and that
he expects that day as he expects the Day of Resurrection and
composedly awaits it with the patience which is (proper to)
our faith. May Great and Glorious God unfold His word and
exalt His claim. As He wishes, so He disposes.
At eventide on Tuesday the n t h of the month, being the
2nd of August, we left Jiddah, after the pilgrims had guaranteed
each other (for payment), and their names had been recorded
in a register kept by the governor of the city, 'Ah ibn Muwaffaq
in accordance with an order from his lord, the ruler of Mecca,
Mukthir ibn 'Isa, mentioned above. This man Mukthir is of
the stock of al-Hasan ibn 'Ah - may God hold him in His
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (579) 95
favour - but he is of those who act unrighteously, and not like
his noble forebears - may God have them in His favour.
We passed on our way that night until we arrived at al-
Qurayn, with the rising of the sun. This place is a staging post
for pilgrims and a place of their encampment. There they put
on the ihram,i4: and there they rest throughout the day of their
arrival. If they remove in the evening and travel all night, they
will come in the morning to the Haram al- Sharif - may God
increase its honour and subhmeness. The returning pilgrims
rest there too, and from it they pass on by night to Jiddah. In
this place is a well of sweet spring water, and by reason of it
the pilgrims do not need to supply themselves with water save
for the night on which they travel to it. Throughout the daylight
hours of Wednesday we stayed resting at al-Qurayn, but
when evening had come, we left it in the pilgrim garb to perform
the 'Umrah [Lesser Pilgrimage],45 and marched throughout
the night. With the dawn, we came near to the Haram,
and descended as the light was about to spread.
We entered Mecca - God protect it - at the first hour of
Thursday the 13th of Rabi', being the 4th of August, by the
'Umrah Gate. As we marched that night, the full moon had
thrown its rays upon the earth, the night had lifted its veil,
voices struck the ears with the TalbiyaP* ['Here am I, O God,
here am I'], from all sides, and tongues were loud in invocation,
humbly beseeching God to grant them their requests,
sometimes redoubling their Talbiyat, and sometimes imploring
with prayers. Oh night most happy, the bride of all the nights
of life, the virgin of the maidens of time.
And so, at the time and on the day we have mentioned, we
came to God's venerable Haram, the place of sojourn of
Abraham the Friend (of God), and found the Ka'bah, the
Sacred House, the unveiled bride47 conducted (like a bride to
her groom) to the supreme felicity of heaven, encompassed by
the deputations [pilgrims] of the All-Merciful. We performed
the tawaf*8 of the new arrival, and then prayed at the revered
Maqam.49 We clung to the covering of the Ka'bah near the
96 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Multazam, which is between the Black Stone and the door,
and is a place where prayers are answered. We entered the
dome of Zamzam and drank of its waters which is 'to the purpose
for which it is drunk',60 as said the Prophet-may God
bless and preserve him - and then performed the saiix between
al-Safa and al-Marwah. After this we shaved and entered a state
oihalal.62 Praise be to God for generously including us in the
pilgrimage to Him and for making us to be of those on whose
behalf the prayers of Abraham reach. Sufficient He is for us
and the best Manager. We took lodging in Mecca at a house
called al-Halal near to the Haram and the Bab al-Suddah, one
of its gates, in a room having many domestic conveniences and
overlooking the Haram and the sacred Ka'bah.
The Month ofjumada 'l-Ula (579)
[22nd of August-20th of September, 1183]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon rose on the night of Monday the 22nd of
August, when we had been in Mecca-may God Most
High exalt it - eighteen days. The new moon of this month
was the most auspicious our eyes had seen in all that had passed
of our life. It rose after we had already entered the seat of the
venerable enclosure, the sacred Haram of God, the dome in
which is the maqam of Abraham, the place from whence the
Prophet's mission (was sent out), and the alighting place of
the faithful spirit Gabriel with inspiration and revelation. May
God with His power and strength inspire us to thanks for His
favour and make us sensible of that amount of privilege He
has made our portion, finally accepting us (into Paradise) and
rewarding us with the accustomed generosity of His beneficent
works, and giving us of His gracious help and support. There
is no God but He.
A description of the Sacred Mosque and the Ancient House
May God bless and exalt it
The venerable House has four corners and is almost square.
The chief of the Banu Shayba who are the custodians of the
House, one Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn 'Abd aJ-Rahman ibn
* * * * of the stock of 'Uthman ibn Talhah ibn Shaybah ibn
Talhah ibn 'Abd al-Dar, the Companion of the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him-and the incumbent of the chamberlainship
of the House, informed me that its height, on the
side which faces the Bab [Gate] al-Safa and which extends
from the Black Stone to the Rukn al-Yamani [Yemen
98 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Corner], is twenty-nine cubits. The remaining sides are twentyeight
cubits because of the slope of the roof towards the waterspout.
The principal corner is the one containing the Black Stone.
There the circumambulation begins, the circumambulator
drawing back (a little) from it so that all of his body might
pass by it, the blessed House being on his left. The first thing
that is met after that is the 'Iraq corner, which faces the north,
then the Syrian corner which faces west, then the Yemen
corner which faces south, and then back to the Black corner
which faces east. That completes one shaut [single course]. The
door of the blessed House is on the side between the 'Iraq
corner and the Black Stone corner, and is close to the Stone
at a distance of barely ten spans. That part of the side of the
House which is between them is called the Multazam: a place
where prayers are answered.
The venerable door is raised above the ground eleven and
a half spans. It is of silver gilt and of exquisite workmanship
and beautiful design, holding the eyes for its excellence and in
emotion for the awe God has clothed His House in. After the
same fashion are the two posts, and the upper lintel over which
is a slab of pure gold about two spans long. The door has two
large silver staples on which is hung the lock. It faces to the
east, and is eight spans wide and thirteen high. The thickness
of the wall in which it turns is five spans. The inside of
the blessed House is overlaid with variegated marbles, and
the walls are all variegated marbles. (The ceiling) is sustained
by three teak pillars of great height, four paces apart, and punctuating
the length of the House, and down its middle. One of
these columns, the first, faces the centre of the side enclosed
by the two Yemen corners, and is three paces distant from it.
The third column, the last, faces the side enclosed by the 'Iraq
and Syrian corners.
The whole circuit of the upper half of the House is plated
with silver, thickly gilt, which the beholder would imagine,
from its thickness, to be a sheet of gold. It encompasses the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 99
four sides and covers the upper half of the walls. The ceiling
of the House is covered by a veil of coloured silk.
The outside of the Ka'bah, on all its four sides, is clothed in
coverings of green silk with cotton warps; and on their upper
parts is a band of red silk on which is written the verse, 'Verily
the first House founded for mankind was that at Bakkah
[Mecca]' [Koran III, 96]. The name of the Imam al-Nasir li
Din Ilah, in depth three cubits, encircles it all. On these coverings
there has been shaped remarkable designs resembling handsome
pulpits, and inscriptions entertaining the name of God
Most High and calling blessings on Nasir, the aforementioned
'Abbaside (Caliph) who had ordered its instalment. With all
this, there was no clash of colour. The number of covers on all
four sides is thirty-four, there being eighteen on the two long
sides, and sixteen on the two short sides.
The Ka'bah has five windows of 'Iraq glass, richly stained.
One of them is in the middle of the ceiling, and at each corner
is a window, one of which is not seen because it is beneath the
vaulted passage described later. Between the pillars (hang)
thirteen vessels, of silver save one that is gold.
The first thing which he who enters at the door will find
to his left is the corner outside which is the Black Stone. Here
are two chests containing Korans. Above them in the corner
are two small silver doors like windows set in the angle of the
corner, and more than a man's stature from the ground. In
the angle which follows, the Yemen, it is the same, but the
doors have been torn out and only the wood to which they
were attached remains. In the Syrian corner it is the same and
the small doors remain. It is the same in the 'Iraq corner,
which is to the right of him who enters. In the 'Iraq corner
is a door called the Bab al-Rahmah [Door of Mercy, usually
called the Door of Repentance, Bab al-Taubah] from which
ascent is made to the roof of the blessed House. It leads to a
vaulted passage connecting with the roof of the House and
having in it a stairway and, at its beginning, the vault containing
the venerable maqam [the standing-stone of Abraham; see
ioo THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Note 49]. Because of this passage the Ancient House has five
corners. The height of both its sides is two statures and it
encloses the 'Iraq corner with the halves of each of those two
sides. Two-thirds of the circuit of this passage is dressed with
pieces of coloured silk, as if it had been previously wrapped
in them and then set in place.
This venerable maqam that is inside the passage is the maqam
of Abraham - God's blessings on our Prophet and on him -
and is a stone covered with silver. Its height is three spans, its
width two and its upper part is larger than the lower. If it is
not frivolous to draw the comparison it is like a large potter's
oven, its middle being narrower than its top or bottom. We
gazed upon it and were blessed by touching and kissing it. The
water of Zamzam was poured for us into the imprints of the
two blessed feet [of Abraham who stood on this stone when
he built the Ka'bah], and we drank it - may God profit us by
it. The traces of both feet are visible, as are the traces of the
honoured and blessed big toes. Glory to God who softened
the stone beneath the tread so that it left its trace as no trace of
foot is left in the soft sand. Glory to God who made it a
manifest sign. The contemplation of this maqam and the
venerable House is an awful sight which distracts the senses
in amazement, and ravishes the heart and mind. You will
see only reverent gazes, flowing tears, eyes dissolved in weeping,
and tongues in humble entreaty to Great and Glorious
God.
Between the venerable door and the 'Iraq corner is a basin
twelve spans long, five and a half spans wide, and about one
in depth. It runs from opposite the door post, on the side of
the 'Iraq corner, towards that corner, and is the mark of the
place of the maqam at the time of Abraham - on whom be
(eternal) happiness - until the Prophet - may God bless and
preserve him - moved it to the place where now it is a musalla
[place of worship]. The basin remained as a conduit for the
water of the House when it is washed. It is a blessed spot
[called al-Ma'jan] and is said to be one of the pools of Paradise,
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) IOI
with men. crowding to pray at it. Its bottom, is spread with
soft white sand.
The place of the venerated Maqam, behind which prayers
are said, faces the space between the blessed door and the 'Iraq
corner, well towards the side of the door. Over it is a wooden
dome, a man's stature or more high, angulated and sharp-edged
[i.e. pyramidal], of excellent modelling, and having four spans
from one angle to another. It was erected on the place where
once was the maqam [standing-stone], and around it is a stone
projection built on the edge like an oblong basin about a span
deep, five paces long, and three paces wide. The maqam was
put into the place we have described in the blessed House as
a measure of safety. Between the maqam and the side of the
House opposite it lie seventeen paces, a pace being three spans.
The place of the Maqam also has a dome made of steel and
placed beside the dome of Zamzam. During the months of the
pilgrimage, when many men have assembled and those from
'Iraq and Khurasan have arrived, the wooden dome is removed
and the steel dome put in its place that it might better support
the press of men.
From the corner containing the Black Stone to the 'Iraq
corner is scarcely fifty-four spans. From the Black Stone to
the ground is six spans, so that the tall man must bend to it
and the short man raise himself (to kiss it). From the 'Iraq
corner to the Syrian corner is scarcely forty-eight spans, and
that is through the inside of the Hijr [an adjacent enclosure];
but around it from the one corner to the other is forty paces
or almost one hundred and twenty spans. The tawaf [circumambulator]
moves outside. (The distance from) the Syrian
corner to the Yemen corner is the same as that from the Black
corner to the 'Iraq corner for they are opposite sides. From
the Yemen to the Black is the same, inside the Hijr, as from
the 'Iraq to the Syrian for they are opposite sides.
The place of circumambulation is paved with wide stones
like marble [they are in fact of fine polished granite] and very
beautiful, some black, some brown and some white. They are
102 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
joined to each other, and reach nine paces from the House
save in the part facing the Maqam where they reach out to
embrace it. The remainder of the Haram, including the
colonnades, is wholly spread with white sand. The place of
circumambulation for the women is at the edge of the paved
stones.
Between the 'Iraq corner and the beginning of the wall of
the Hijr is the entrance to the Hijr; it is four paces wide, that
is six cubits exactly, for we measured it by hand. This place
is not enclosed in the Hijr, and is that part of the House which
the Quraysh left,53 and is, as true tradition has it, six cubits.
Opposite this entrance, at the Syrian corner, is another of the
same size. Between that part of the wall of the House which
is under the Mizab [waterspout] and the wall of the Hijr opposite,
following the straight line which cuts through the middle
of the aforementioned Hijr, he forty spans. The distance from
entrance to entrance is sixteen paces, which is forty-eight spans.
This place, I mean the surroundings of the wall (of the Ka'bah,
under the Mizab), is all tessellated marble, wonderfully joined
* • • * - ^ k bands 0 f gilded copper worked into its surface
like a chess-board, being interlaced with each other and with
shapes of mihrabs. When the sun strikes them, such light and
brightness shine from them that the beholder conceives them
to be gold, dazzling the eyes with their rays. The height of
the marble wall of this Hijr is five and a half spans and its
width four and a half. Inside the Hijr is a wide paving,
round which the Hijr bends as it were in two-thirds of a circle.
It is laid with tessellated marble, cut in discs the size of the
palm of the hand, of a dinar and more minute than that, and
joined with remarkable precision. It is composed with wonderful
art, is of singular perfection, beautifully inlaid and
checkered, and is superbly set and laid. The beholder will see
bendings, inlays, mosaics of tiles, chess-board forms and the
like, of various forms and attributes, such as will fix his gaze
for their beauty. Or let his looks roam from the carpet of
flowers of many colours to the mihrabs over which bend arches
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 103
of marble, and in which are these forms we have described
and the arts we have mentioned.
Beside it are two slabs of marble adjacent to the wall of the
Hijr opposite the Mizab, on which art has worked such delicate
leaves, branches, and trees as could not be done by skilled
hands cutting with scissors from paper. It is a remarkable sight.
The one who decreed that they should be worked in this
fashion is the Imam of the East, Abu '1-'Abbas Ahmad al-Nasir
ibn al-Mustadi' billah Abu Muhammad al-Hasan ibn al-
Mustanjid billah Abu '1-Muzaffar Yusif al-'Abbasi - may God
hold him in His favour. Facing the waterspout, in the middle
of the Hijr and the centre of the marble wall, is a marble slab
of most excellent chiselling with a cornice round it bearing
an inscription in striking black in which is written, '(This is)
among the things ordered to be done by the servant and Caliph
of God Abu '1-'Abbas Ahmad al-Nasir li dini Ilah, Prince of
the Faithful, in the year 576 [1180]'.
The Mizab is on the top of the wall which overlooks the Hijr.
It is of gilded copper and projects four cubits over the Hijr, its
breadth being a span. This place under the waterspout is also
considered as being a place where, by the favour of God Most
High, prayers are answered. The Yemen corner is the same.
The wall connecting this place with the Syrian corner is called
al-Mustajar [The Place of Refuge]. Underneath the waterspout,
and in the court of the Hijr near to the wall of the blessed
House, is the tomb of Isma'il [Ishmael] - may God bless and
preserve him. Its mark is a slab of green marble, almost oblong
and in the form of a mihrab. Beside it is a round green slab
of marble, and both [they are verde antico] are remarkable to
look upon. There are spots on them both which turns them
from their colour to something of yellow so that they are like
a mosaic of colours, and I compare them to the spots that are
left in the crucible after the gold has been melted in it. Beside
this tomb, and on the side towards the 'Iraq corner, is the tomb
of his mother Hajar [Hagar] - may God hold her in His favour
- its mark being a green stone a span and a half wide. Men are
io4 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
blessed by praying in these two places in the Hijr, and men
are right to do so, for they are part of the Ancient House and
shelter the two holy and venerated bodies. May God cast His
light upon them and advantage with their blessings all who
pray over them. Seven spans he between the two holy tombs.
The dome of the Well of Zamzam is opposite the Black
Corner, and lies twenty-four paces from it. The Maqam, which
we have already mentioned and behind which prayers are said,
is to the right of this dome, from the corner of which to the
other is ten paces. The inside of the dome is paved with pure
white marble. The orifice of the blessed well is in the centre
of the dome deviating towards the wall which faces the
venerated House. Its depth is eleven statures of a man as we
measured it, and the depth of the water is seven statures, as it
is said. The door of this dome faces east, and the door of the
dome of 'Abbas and that of the Jewish dome face north. The
angle of that side of the dome named after the Jews,64 which
faces the Ancient House, reaches the left corner of the back
wall of the 'Abbaside corner which faces east. Between them lies
that amount of deviation. Beside the dome of the Well of
Zamzam and behind it stands the qabbat al-Sharab [the dome
of drinking], which was erected by 'Abbas-may God hold
him in His favour. Beside this 'Abbaside dome, obliquely to
it, is the dome named after the Jews. These two domes are
used as storerooms for pious endowments made to the blessed
House, such as Korans, books, candlesticks, and the like. The
'Abbaside dome is still called al-Sharabiyyah because it was a
place of drinking for the pilgrims; and there, until to-day, the
water of Zamzam is put therein to cool in earthenware jars
and brought forth at eventide for the pilgrims to drink. These
jars are called dawraq and have one handle only. The orifice
of the Well of Zamzam is of marble stones so well joined,
with lead poured into the interstices, that time will not ravage
them. The inside of the orifice is similar, and round it are lead
props attached to it to reinforce the strength of the binding
and the lead overlay. These props number thirty-two, and their
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 105
tops protrude to hold the brim of the well round the whole
of the orifice. The circumference of the orifice is forty spans,
its depth four spans and a half, and its thickness a span and
a half. Round the inside of the dome runs a trough of width
one span, and depth about two spans and raised five spans from
the ground, and it is filled with water for the ritual ablutions.
Around it runs a stone block on which men mount to perform
the ablutions.
The blessed Black Stone is enchased in the corner facing east.
The depth to which it penetrates it is not known, but it is
said to extend two cubits into the wall. Its breadth is twothirds
of a span, its length one span and a finger joint. It has
four pieces, joined together, and it is said that it was the Qarmata65
[Carmathians] -may God curse them-who broke it.
Its edges have been braced with a sheet of silver whose white
shines brightly against the black sheen and polished brilliance
of the Stone, presenting the observer a striking spectacle which
will hold his looks. The Stone, when kissed, has a softness and
moistness which so enchants the mouth that he who puts his
lips to it would wish them never to be removed. This is one
of the special favours of Divine Providence, and it is enough
that the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - declare
to be a covenant of God on earth. May God profit us by the
kissing and touching of it. By His favour may all who yeam
fervently for it be brought to it. In the sound piece of the
stone, to the right of him who presents himself to kiss it, is
a small white spot that shines and appears like a mole on the
blessed surface. Concerning this white mole, there is a tradition
that he who looks upon it clears his vision, and when kissing
it one should direct one's lips as closely as one can to the place
of the mole.
The sacred Mosque is encompassed by colonnades in three
(horizontal) ranges on three rows of marble columns so
arranged as to make it like a single colonnade. Its measurement
in length is four hundred cubits, its width three hundred,
and its area is exactly forty-eight maraja [sing, maraf, a measure
io6 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
of area amongst the western Arabs equalling fifty square cubits].
The area between the colonnades is great, but at the time of
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - it was small
and the dome of Zamzam was outside it. Facing the Syrian
corner, wedged in the ground, is the capital of a column which
at first was the limit of the Haram. Between this capital and
the Syrian corner are twenty-two paces. The Ka'bah is in the
centre (of the Haram) and its four sides run directly to the
east, south, north and west. The number of the marble columns,
which myself I counted, is four hundred and seventy-one,
excluding the stuccoed column that is in the Dar al-Nadwah
(House of Counsel), which was added to the Haram. This is
within the colonnade which runs from the west to the north
and is faced by the Maqam and the 'Iraq corner. It has a large
court and is entered from the colonnade. Against the whole
length of this colonnade are benches under vaulted arches where
sit the copyists, the readers of the Koran, and some who ply
the tailor's trade.
The Haram enfolds rings of students sitting around their
teachers, and learned men. Along the wall of the colonnade
facing it are also benches under arches in the same fashion. This
is the colonnade which runs from the south to the east. In the
other colonnades, the benches against the walls have no arches
over them. The buildings now in the Haram are at the height
of perfection. At the Bab Ibrahim [Abraham's Gate] is another
entrance from the colonnade which runs from the west to the
south and has also stuccoed columns. I found in the writing of
Abu Ja'far ibn ['Ah] al-Fanaki al-Qurtubi, the jurisprudent and
traditionalist, that the number of columns was four hundred
and eighty; for I had not counted those outside the Safa Gate.
Of the enlarging of the Sacred Haram and the adornment of
its buildings by the Mahdi Muhammad ibn Abi Ja'far al-Mansur
al-'Abbasi there is noble evidence. On the side running from
west to north high on the wall of the cloister I found written,
'The servant of God Muhammad al-Mahdi, Prince of the Faithful
- may God have him in His care - ordered the enlargement
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 107
of the Sacred Mosque for the pilgrims to God's House and for
those upon the 'umrah. In the year 167 [A.D. 783].'
The Haram has seven minarets. Four are at each corner,
another is at the Dar al-Nadwah, and another at the Safa Gate
indicates the Gate and is the smallest of them, no one being
able to climb up to it for its narrowness. The seventh stands
at the Abraham Gate which we shall mention later.
The Safa Gate faces the Black corner in the colonnade which
runs from the south to the east. In the middle of the colonnade
which is opposite the door are two columns facing the aformentioned
corner and bearing this engraved inscription: 'The
Servant of God Muhammad al-Mahdi, Prince of the Faithful
- may God have him in His favour - ordered the erection of
these two columns to indicate the path of the Messenger of
God [Muhammad] - may God bless and preserve him - to al-
Safa, that the pilgrims to the House of God and those that
dwell therein might follow him. (Done) by the hand of Yaqtin
ibn Musa and Ibrahim ibn Salih in the year 167 [A.D. 783].'
On the door of the holy Ka'bah is engraved in gold, with
graceful characters long and thick, that hold the eyes for their
form and beauty, this writing: 'This is amongst those things
erected by order of the servant and Caliph of God, the Imam
Abu 'Abdullah Muhammad al-Muqtafi. li Amri Ilah, Prince of
the Faithful. May God bless him and the Imams his righteous
ancestors, perpetuating for him the prophetic inheritance and
making it an enduring word for his prosperity until the Day
of Resurrection. In the year 550 [A.D. 1155].' In this wise (was
it written) on the faces of the two door-leaves. These two noble
door-leaves are enclosed by a thick band of silver gilt, excellently
carved, which rises to the blessed lintel, passes over it
and then goes round the sides of the two door-leaves. Between
them, when they are closed together, is a sort of broad strip
of silver gilt which runs the length of the doors and is attached
to the door-leaf which is to the left of him who enters the House.
The Kiswah [lit. 'robe', covering] of the sacred Ka'bah is of
green silk as we have said. There are thirty-four pieces: nine
108 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
on the side between the Yemen and Syrian corners, nine also
on the opposite side between the Black corner and the 'Iraq
corner, and eight on both the side between the 'Iraq and Syrian
corners and on that between the Yemen and the Black. Together
they come to appear as one single cover comprehending the
four sides. The lower part of the Ka'bah is surrounded by a
projecting border built of stucco, more than a span in depth
and two spans or a little more in width, inside which is wood,
not discernible. Into this are driven iron pegs which have at
their ends iron rings that are visible. Through these is inserted
a rope of hemp, thick and strongly made, which encircles the
four sides, and which is sewn with strong, twisted, cotton,
thread to a girdle, like that of the sirwal [the Arab cotton
bloomers], fixed to the hems of the covers. At the juncture of
the covers at the four corners, they are sewn together for more
than a man's stature, and above that they are brought together
by iron hooks engaged in each other. At the top, round the
sides of the terrace, runs another projecting border to which
the upper parts of the covers are attached with iron rings, after
the fashion described. Thus the blessed Kiswah is sewn top and
bottom, and firmly buttoned, being never removed save at its
renewal year by year. Glory to God who perpetuates its honour
until the Day of Resurrection. There is no God but He.
The door of the sacred Ka'bah is opened every Monday and
Friday, except in the month of Rajab, when it is opened every
day. It is opened at the first rising of the sun. The custodians
of the House, the Shayba advance, seeking to forestall each
other in moving a big stairway that resembles a large pulpit.
It has nine long steps, and wooden supports that reach the
ground and have attached to them four large wheels, plated
with iron as against their contact with the ground, on which
the ladder moves until it reaches the Sacred House. The highest
step reaches the blessed threshold of the door. The chief of the
Shayba, a mature man of handsome mien and aspect, then
ascends it, carrying the key of the blessed lock. With him is
a custodian holding up a black veil that is (hung) before the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 109
door and. under which his arms sag66 while the aforesaid chief
of the Shayba opens the door. "When he has opened the lock,
he kisses the threshold, enters the House alone, closes the door
behind him. and stays there the time of two rak'ah. The other
Shayba then enter and also close the door and perform the
rak'ah. The door is then opened and men compete to enter.
While the venerated door is being opened, the people stand
before it with lowered looks and hands outstretched in humble
supplication to God. When it is opened they cry, 'Allahu Akbar
[God is Great], raising a clamour and calling in a loud voice,
'Ah, my God, open to us the gates of Your mercy and pardon,
Most Merciful of the Merciful.' They then 'enter in peace,
secure' [Koran XV, 46].
In the wall facing the entrant, which is that running from
the Yemen corner to the Syrian, are five marble panels set
lengthways as if they were doors. They come down to a distance
of five spans from the ground, and each one of them is
about a man's stature in height. Three of them are red, and
two green, and all have white tessellations so that I have never
seen a more beautiful sight. They are as if speckled. A red one
adjoins the Yemen corner, and next to it at a distance of five
spans is a green. At the place opposite this, falling back from
it three cubits, is the musalli [praying place] of the Prophet -
may God bless and preserve him - and men crowd to pray at
it and be blessed. They are all sited in this manner, there being
between each panel and the other the distance we have stated.
Between each pair is a marble slab of pure and unstained whiteness
on which Great and Glorious God had fashioned, at its
first creation, remarkable designs, mclining to blue, of trees and
branches, and another beside it with the same designs exactly,
as if they were parts (of the same stone); and if one were placed
over the other each design would correspond with its opposite.
Beyond a peradventure each slab is the half of the other, and
when the cut was made they divided to make these designs
and each was placed beside its sister. The space between a green
and a red panel is that of two slabs, their combined width being
no
THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
five spans, according to the number mentioned above. The
designs on these slabs vary in shape, and each slab lies beside
its sister. The sides of these marble slabs are braced by cornices,
two fingers wide, of marble tessellated with spotted greens and
reds, and speckled whites, that are like wands worked on a
lathe, such as to stagger the imagination. In this wall there are
six spaces with white marble. In the wall, which is to the left
of him who enters, which is from the Black corner to the
Yemen, there are four marble panels, two green and two red.
Between them are five [two spaces must therefore be on the
flanks] spaces with white marble, and all in the fashion described.
In the wall to the right of the entrant, which is that from the
Black corner to the 'Iraq, there are three panels, two red and
one green, interspersed with three spaces of white marble. This
is the wall that runs to the corner containing the Bab al-Rahmah
[the Door of Mercy or to-day the Bab al-Taubah] which is
three spans wide and seven spans high. That side-piece of this
door which is to your right as you face it is of green marble
and two-thirds of a span wide. In the wall from the Syrian to the
'Iraq corner are three panels of marble, two red and one green,
connected by three spaces of white marble in the manner
described. These slabs of marble are crowned with two fasciae,
one over the other, each being two spans wide, and of gold
with an inscription in lapis-lazuli of fine hand. These fasciae
reach the gold engraving on the upper half of the wall. The
side on the right of the entrant has one fascia. In these double
fasciae some parts (of the inscription) have been effaced.
In each of the four corners, towards the ground, are two
small tablets of green marble which enclose the corner (on both
sides). Similarly, both of the two (small) silver doors which,
in the form of windows, are found in each corner, are enclosed
by small side-pieces of green marble the size of the openings.
At the beginning of all the walls described comes a red marble
panel and at the end also comes a red, while the green are distributed
between them after the manner related, save on the
wall to the left of the entrant, for there the first marble you
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) m
find, beside the Black comer, is green; then comes a red, and
so on until the end of the arrangement we have explained.
Beside the noble Maqam is the preacher's pulpit [minbar]
which also is on four wheels in the mode we have explained.
When, on Fridays, the time of prayer approaches, it is brought
to the side of the Ka'bah that faces the Maqam, which is that
which runs between the Black and the 'Iraq corners, and is
propped against it. The khatib [preacher] comes through the
Gate of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - which
is opposite the Maqam and in the colonnade which runs from
east to north. He wears a black dress, worked with gold, a
black turban similarly worked, and a taylasan of fine linen. All
this is the livery of the Caliph, which he sends to the preachers
of his land. With lofty gait, calm and stately, he slowly paces
between two black banners held by two muezzins of his tribe.
Before him goes another of his people bearing a red staff, turned
on a lathe, and having tied to its top a cord of twisted skin,
long and thin, with a small thong at its tip. He cracks it in the
air with so loud a report that it is heard both within the Haram
and without, like a warning of the arrival of the preacher. He
does not cease to crack it until they are near the pulpit. They
call (this whip) the farqa ah.
Coming to the pulpit, the khatib turns aside to the Black
Stone, kisses it, and prays before it. Then he goes to the pulpit,
led by the Zamzam muezzin, who is the chief of the muezzins
of the noble Haram and also dressed in black clothes. He bears
on his shoulder a sword which he holds in his hand without
girding it. The muezzin girds the khatib with the sword as he
ascends the first step, which then, with the ferrule of his scabbard,
he strikes a blow which all present can hear. He strikes
it again on the second step and on the third. When he reaches
the top step, he strikes the fourth blow, and stands facing the
Ka'bah praying in low tones. Then he turns to right and left
and says, 'Peace upon you, and the mercy and blessings of God.'
The congregation returns the salutation ['Upon you be peace']
and he then sits. The muezzins place themselves in front of him
112 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and call the adthan in one voice. When they have finished,
the khatib delivers the address, reminding, exhorting, inspiring,
and waxing eloquent. He then sits down in the conventional
sitting of the preacher and strikes with the sword a fifth time.
He then delivers the second (part of) the Khutbah multiplying
prayers for Muhammad-may God bless and preserve himand
for his family, begging God's favour for his Companions
and naming in particular the four Caliphs-may God have
them all in His favour - praying for the two uncles of the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve them-Hamzah and
'Abbas, and for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, uniting to all (the
words): 'May God hold them in His favour.' He then prayed
for the Mothers of the Faithful wives of the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve them - and begged God's favour for Fatimah
the Fair and for Khadijah the Great in this language. He then
prayed for the' Abbaside Caliph Abu '1-'Abbas Ahmad al-Nasir,
then for the Emir of Mecca, Mukthir ibn 'Isa ibn Fulaytah ibn
Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far ibn Abi Hashim al-Hasani,
then for Salah al-Din [Saladin] Abu 'l-Muzaffar Yusif ibn
Ayyub and his heir and brother Abu Bakr ibn Ayyub. At the
mention in the prayers of Saladin, from all sides tongues
quivered (in emotion) as they cried 'Amen' to that.
'If God to His servant one day gives love,
He gives it him in love of all mankind.'
And right it is they should, for the goodly care and kind
attention he has lavished on them, and for his raising of the
customs tax from off them.
We learnt at this time that a letter had come from him to
the Emir Mukthir, the most important chapter of which was
the commendation regarding the care of the pilgrims, with the
insistence on beneficence and kindness being shown towards
them, and the raising of the hand which bore upon them, and
the giving of orders to this effect to the servants, the men of the
following, and the officers of the army. 'We and you,' said
the Sultan, 'are charged with the well-being of the pilgrims.
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 113
Reflect upon this noble task and generous aim. The benefits
of God are two-fold for him who benefits His servants, and
His bounteous care reaches him who exerts his care for them.'
Great and Glorious God is the guarantor for the reward of
those who do good. For He directs all these things. There is
no Lord but Him.
During the khutbah, the two black banners are planted on
the first step of the minbar, and held by two muezzins. At the
side of the entrance to the minbar are two rings in which the
banners are placed. When the khatib has ended the prayers, he
leaves with the banners on his right and left and before him the
farqaah, after the manner in which he entered. This is at once
the signal of the departure of the preacher and the end of the
prayers, and the minbar is returned to its place beside the Maqam.
On the night on which the new moon of this month of
Jumada 1-Ula rose, the Emir of Mecca, the aforesaid Mukthir,
came early in the morning, as the rising of the sun, to the
noble Haram. Around him were his leading men, and Koran
readers went before him. He entered by the Gate of the Prophet
-may God bless and preserve him-with his Negroes, those
that are known as harrabah [spearmen], who, spear in hand,
whirled in front of him. His aspect was modest, calm, and
dignified, and his mien that of his noble ancestors - may God
bless and preserve them. He wore a white dress, was girded
with a short sword, and for a turban had a kurziyyah of fine
white wool. When he had come close to the noble Maqam,
he stopped. A linen carpet was spread for him and he prayed
two rak'ahs. He then advanced to the Black Stone and kissed
it and then began the tawaf. On the dome of Zamzam had
climbed a youth who was the brother of the Zamzam muezzin,
he who is the first muezzin in making the calls and whom the
others imitate and follow. When the Emir had completed one
shaut [circuit] and was approaching the Stone, the youth, who
was dressed in his finest cloths and wore a turban, raised his
voice in prayer from the top of the dome, opening with
these words: 'Grant this day, oh God, to our Lord the Emir
114 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
everlasting happiness and all-embracing favour.' This he followed
with good wishes for the month, and a gifted discourse in
rhymed prose full of invocations and eulogies, and then, concluding
with three or four verses of poetry in praise of the Emir
and his noble ancestors and the excellence of the Prophecy,
came to silence.
When the Emir was under the shade of the Yemen corner
on his way to the Stone, the youth began another prayer of
the same kind, adding other verses of exactly the same purport,
which seemed to have been taken from an ode of praise
to him. So it continued for seven circuits and until it was over.
The Koran readers were in front of the Emir throughout his
tawaf. The order and splendour of this scene, the beauty of
the voice of that muezzin, notwithstanding his youth, for he
was about eleven years old or thereabout, the eloquence of the
discourse he made in prose and verse, the high voices of the
readers of the Book of Great and Glorious God, all these things
together move and affect the spirit, draw tears from the eyes,
and bring to the memory the family of the Prophet from whom
God has removed all impurity and whom He has cleansed.
When the Emir had finished the tawaf, he prayed two rattahs
at the Multazam, then prayed a rak'ah behind the Maqam and
departed with his retinue around him; and it is his custom not
to appear again in the Haram save at the time of the new moon.
The Ancient House is built of large blocks of dark granite,
compactly set together and joined by a strongly binding cement,
so that the days cannot change them nor time destroy. An odd
feature of it is that a piece which split from the Yemen corner
was nailed in its place with silver nails, which are to be seen,
and it became better than it was.
One of the wondrous things about the Ancient House is that
it rises in the middle of the Haram like, if it is not irreverent to
make the comparison,67 a lofty tower. The pigeons in the
Haram cannot be counted for their number, and their safety
is a matter for proverbs. In no case will a pigeon come down
to the roof of the Ancient House or alight upon it in any
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 115
circumstance. You will see a pigeon flying over all the Haram,
and when it approaches the House turning from it right or
left. All other birds are the same. I read in The Notes on Mecca
that no bird will alight upon the House save when struck by
illness, in which case either will it die upon the instant or
straightway be cured. Glory to Him who has made the House
worthy of honour and deference.
Another remarkable fact is that when the noble door (of the
House) is opened on the set days we have mentioned, and the
Haram is choked with people, all will enter the House and
yet, by the power of Great and Glorious God, it will not be
too small for them. There will not be one place (of prayer)
but everyone has prayed in it. When they have gone forth
from it, men will meet each other and ask whether they had
been in the House that day and all will answer, 'I entered and
I prayed in such a place and in such another,' and all will have
prayed there. To God indeed are palpable wonders and miraculous
proofs. May He be glorified and exalted. One of the
marvels of the care of God - Blessed and Exalted is He - is
never, for any hour of the day or time of night, is there not
someone performing a tawaf; and never will you find a man
who says that he saw the House without there being someone
circumambulating it. Glory to Him who honoured it and
made it grand, perpetuating its nobility until the Day ot
Resurrection.
Over the colonnades of the Haram is a roof which encompasses
with them all four sides. It is embattled throughout with
large and angulated merlons, each side of the merlon having
three angles which themselves are like small merlons. The
lowest angle touches the angle of the adjoining merlon. Underneath
each juncture is a round hole, a span in circumference,
which penetrates it and allows the air to pass through. The
rays of the sun and the moon strike through these holes and
then they appear like round moons. Around the four sides the
merlons continue as if (first) it was built in one piece and then
the interruptions and angles made. The result is a form that
116 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR.
is a remarkable sight. In the centre of all four sides (of the
Haram) is a stuccoed frieze, chiselled and having apertures, that
passes between the merlons and which I estimate to be about
thirty spans long. Each frieze faces one side of the holy Ka'bah
which surmounts the merlons like a crown.
The minarets also have singular forms, for the (lower) half
is angulated at the four sides, by means of finely sculptured
stones, remarkably set, and surrounded by a wooden lattice of
rare workmanship. Above the lattice there rises into the air
a spire that seems as the work of a turner, wholly dressed with
baked bricks fitting the one into the other with an art that
draws the gaze for its beauty. At the top of this spire is a globe
also encircled by a wooden lattice of exactly the same pattern
as the other. All these minarets have a distinct form, not one
resembling the other; but all are of the type described, the
lower half being angulated, and the upper columned.
In the upper half of the Zamzam Dome, of the 'Abbaside
Dome which is called the 'Place of Drinking', and of the dome
which sits obliquely to its left and is called The Jewish Dome,
there is wonderful ornamental wood carving in which the
artificer displayed much elegance, and at their summits are
wooden balustrades of lattice-work with delicate perforations
and apertures. Inside the lattice of the Zamzam Dome is a terrace
in whose middle is a kind of minaret ball and on which the
Zamzam muezzin makes his call to prayers. From this ball rises a
slender stuccoed column with at its tip an iron vessel which
in the solemn month of Ramadan they use as a lamp. On that
side of the dome which faces the Ancient House are chains on
which hang crystal lamps that are lit each night; and on the
side to the right, which faces north, it is the same. On all its
sides are three balustrades set up like doors and sustained by
small glass columns than which no more beautiful work could
be seen. Some were twisted like bracelets, especially on the
side of the dome facing the Black Stone where the work on the
column reaches the height of perfection. Round each column
are three or four fillets, and below, between each fillet * * * *
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) II?
in which there are artistic works that are wonderful to look
upon. Some of the columns are twisted like a bracelet.
The side of the dome facing the Black Stone has a marble
bench running round it. On this men sit pondering the nobility
of that place, for it is the most noble of the world, and described
as partaking of the nobility of places in the world to come.
For the Black Stone is before you, the venerated door and the
House face you, the Maqam is to your right, the Safa Gate
to your left, and the well of Zamzam is behind your back.
Let this be sufficient to you.
Attached to each of these balustrades are bars of iron interlaced
with each other as if they were other balustrades. One
of the corners of the wooden lattice enclosing the 'Abbaside
Dome touches one of the corners of the lattice of the Jewish
Dome, and whoever may be on the roof of this can cross to
the roof of the other over the two corners. Inside this dome
are ornamental stucco works of great beauty.
The Haram has four Sunnite [orthodox] imams, and a fifth
for the sect called the Zaydis. The nobles among the inhabitants
of this town follow the Zaydi rites. In the call to prayer they
add, 'Come to the best of works' after the muezzin's words,
'Come to Salvation.' They are blaspheming Rafidites, and God
in the life to come will take them to account and give them
their deserts.68 On Fridays they do not attend congregational
prayers but repeat the midday prayers four times, and at sunset
pray after the other imams have ended. The first of the Sunni
imams is the Shafi'i - God's mercy upon him - and we have
mentioned him first for he is the surrogate of the 'Abbaside
Caliph. He is the first to offer prayer, which he does behind
the Maqam of Abraham - may God bless and preserve him and
our noble Prophet. But at the evening prayers, all four imams
pray together concurrently because of the shortness of time.
The Shafi'i muezzin begins with the iqamah [requiring the congregation
to stand in line and introducing the prayers], and
then the muezzins of the other imams follow. Sometimes into
these prayers there enters an oversight or inadvertence by the
G
118 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
worshippers, and then from all sides comes die cry, 'God is
Great.' At times a Maliki will recite the rak'ah of the Shafi'i or
of the Hanafi, or salute an imam that is not his. You will observe
every ear hstening to the voice of its imam or muezzin, fearing
an oversight, yet still many occur. Then comes the Maliki
-God's mercy upon him-who prays opposite the Yemen
corner. He has a stone rnihrab resembling the mihrabs placed
on the high road.69 The Hanafi-God's mercy upon himfollows,
and he prays opposite the waterspout and under a
hatim made for him. He is the most splendid of the imams,
having more candles and such like, for the whole of the Persian
Empire is of his rite and his congregation is very large. He
comes last, for the Hanbali - God's mercy upon him - prays
with the Maliki at one time. His place of prayer is opposite
the side between the Black Stone and the Yemen corner. The
noon and afternoon prayers he recites near to the Hanafis in
the colonnade which runs from west to north; and the Hanafi
recites them in the colonnade running from west to south facing
his milirab, for he has no hatim. The Shafi'i has a richly embellished
hatim opposite the Maqam. The description of the hatim
is as follows: Two wooden boards are joined by rungs like a
ladder, and facing them are two more wooden boards in the
same style. This wooden arrangement is set on two pedestals
of stucco that do not rise high, and another piece of wood is
nailed high across them. From this suspend iron hooks on which
glass lanterns are hung. Sometimes a latticed balustrade is
attached to the upper transverse for its whole length. Between
the two pedestals of stucco that hold the wooden arrangement
the Hanafi imam has a rnihrab in which he prays. The Hanbali
has a hatim without decoration, near the Hanafi hatim, and
ascribed to Ramasht, a Persian of substance of whose liberality
some bounteous records stand in the Haram. God's mercy
upon him.
Facing the Hijr is a hatim, also undecorated, ascribed to the
vizier al-Muqaddam, (as he is known) in this vague form of
utterance. All these places are included in the circuit of the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 119
Ancient House. A short distance from the House are torches
that are kindled in iron vessels fitted on wooden poles driven
(into the ground), thus illuminating the whole of the noble
Haram. Candles are set in front of the imams in their mihrabs.
The Maliki has fewer candles than the rest and is the poorest,
for his rite is uncommon in these parts. The bulk of the people
are of the Shafi'i rite, to which also belong the learned men
and jurisprudents of the land. But this is not so in Alexandria,
where most of the people are Malikis, and where lives the
jurisprudent ibn 'Awf, a venerable man of learning and the
best among the Malikite imams.
At the end of the sunset prayers the Zamzam muezzin stands
on the roof of the Zamzam. Dome, to which ascent is made
by a wooden stairway on the side facing the Safa Gate and
raises his voice in invocation for the 'Abbaside Imam [Caliph],
Ahmad al-Nasir li din Ilah, then for the Emir Mukthir, then
for Salah al-Din [Saladin] Emir of Syria and of all the provinces
of Egypt and of the Yemen, famed for his good deeds and
having noble virtues. When in the prayers they come to his
mention, those performing the tawaf raise their voices in 'Amen'
with tongues fortified by sincere hearts and true intentions, and
trembling (with emotion), so that hearts melt with feeling at
the fine praise which God has bestowed on this just Sultan,
and at the love of mankind which He has planted in him; and
the worshippers of God in his land are witness of this. The
muezzin follows this with a prayer for die Emirs of the Yemen,
vice-regents of Saladin, and then for all Muslims, pilgrims, and
travellers. He then descends. Thus is his constant practice.
In the 'Abbaside Dome is a store containing a large and
capacious chest that holds the Koran of one of the four Caliphs
who were Companions of the Messenger of God - may God
bless and preserve him. It is written in the hand of Zayd ibn
Thabit - may God hold him in His favour - and was copied
in the eighteenth year after the death of the Messenger of God
- may God bless and preserve him. It lacks many pages. Two
wooden boards, covered with leather, bind it, and the clasps
i2o THE TRAVELS OF IBN
are of brass; the "pages are big and comprehend, much script.
We inspected it and were blessed in kissing it and stroking our
cheeks with it. May God advantage us for our purpose in this.
The custodian of this dome, whose task it was to show it to
us, told us that when the people of Mecca are smitten by a
drought, or suffer a rising of prices, they take out this Koran
and, opening the door of the venerated House, place it on the
blessed threshold with the venerated maqam, the maqam of
the Friend .(of God) Abraham-may God bless both the
Prophet and him. With bared heads they gather round, humbly
beseeching and entreating God by the venerated Koran and
the sublime maqam, and leaving not their place until the mercy
of God, Great and Glorious is He, has overtaken them. God
indeed is good to His servants. There is no God but He.
Beside the Haram are many houses whose doors open upon
it - let it suffice for you so noble a vicinage - such as the house
of Zubaydah, that of the qadi, one called al-'Ajalah, and others.
Around the Haram too are many houses with belvederes and
with roofs from which one can go over on to that of the Haram,
and on which their inhabitants pass the night and cool their
water on top of the merlons. They look upon the Ancient
House in continuous worship, and are gifted, by the grace and
favour of God, with the vicinage of His Holy House.
In the hand of the jurisprudent, the ascetic and godly Abu
Ja'far al-Fanaki of Cordova we found it recorded that the
measurements of the Sacred Mosque, both in length and in
breadth, are those I have already given. The length of the
Mosque of the Prophet [in Medina] - may God bless and preserve
him - is three hundred cubits, and the breadth two hundred.
The number of its columns is three hundred and its
minarets three. Its area is twenty-four Maghribi marajd, which
is fifty square cubits. The length of the mosque of Jerusalem -
may God restore it to the Muslims -is seven hundred and eighty
cubits, and its breadth four hundred and fifty. It has four
hundred and fourteen columns, five hundred lamps, fifty doors
and an area of one hundred and forty and two-fifths marajd'.
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 121
A note on the Gates of the noble Haram
May God sanctify it
The Haram has nineteen gates, most of which have several
openings as we shall presently, God willing, describe. Bab
[Gate] al-Safa with five doors and anciently described as the
Gate of the Banu Makhzum; Bab al-Khalaqiyyin [the Old
Clothes Men], also called Bab Jiyad the lesser,60 which has two
doors and is new; Bab al-'Abbas - may God hold him in His
favour - with three doors; Bab 'Ah - may God hold him in His
favour-with three doors; Bab al-Nabi [the Prophet]-may
God bless and preserve him.-with two doors; a small Bab,
beside the Bab Banu Shayba, and without name; Bab Banu
Shayba, with three doors and also called the Bab Banu 'Abd
al-Shams, and being the Gate by which the Caliph enters; Bab
al-Nadwah [of Counsel], consisting of three gates, two in the
Dar al-Nadwah [House of Counsel] in line with each other,
and a third in the west corner of the Dar; by including this
separate gate, the number of gates in the Haram is twenty;
a small Bab beside the Bab Banu Shayba like a wicket-gate
and having no name, but said to be called Bab al-Ribat
[Asylum] because through it entrance is made to the Sufi
Ribat; a small Bab in the Dar al-'Ajalah which is new; Bab
al-Suddah,61 single; Bab al-'Umrah, single; Bab al-Hazwarah,
with two doors; Bab Ibrahim - may God bless and preserve
him - single; a Bab also ascribed to Hazwarah, with two doors;
Bab Jiyad the greater, with two doors; Bab Jiyad the greater
also having two doors;62 a Bab called Jiyad also having two
doors. There are some who ascribe two of the four Jiyad Gates
to flour-millers. Stories vary, but we have done our best to
give the names that are closest to authenticity. God is our
recourse: there is no Lord but He.
The Bab Ibrahim - may God bless and preserve him - is in
a large and spacious square in which also is the house of the
jurisprudent al-Miknasi - may God have mercy on his soulwho
was the Maliki imam of the Haram. There too is a room
i22 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
which acts as a store for the books endowed in piety to the
Malikis in the Haram. This square adjoins the colonnade running
from west to south, and is outside it. Beside the Bab
(Ibrahim), to the right of the entrant, is a minaret unlike those
we have mentioned. It has a stuccoed lattice of oblong shape
like rnihrabs and surrounded by ornamental carving of remarkable
workmanship. By the Gate is a great dome, prominent
in height, in which it approaches the minaret. Within are
notable works of stucco, and ornamental lattices, of which
description fails. Without are pieces of stucco like round pedestals
set one over the other. The ball on the minaret rests on
stucco supports, with apertures between each one. Outside the
Bab Ibrahim is a well named after him - on whom be (eternal)
happiness.
We began (the enumeration of these Gates) with the Bab
al-Safa because it is the biggest, and because it is from this gate
that one goes forth to perform the sdi [the running seven
times between Mounts Safa and Marwah]. Every pilgrim who
comes to Mecca - may God exalt it - on the 'umrah [lesser
pilgrimage] should preferably enter by the Bab Banu Shayba,
then perform the seven circuits, and finally leave by the Bab
al-Safa making his way between the two columns that the
Mahdi - God's mercy on his soul - had ordered should be
erected to show, as we have already remarked, the way that
the Messenger of God had taken to al-Safa. Forty-six paces He
between these two columns and the Yemen corner, and from
them to the Bab al-Safa is thirty paces. From Bab al-Safa to
al-Safa is seventy-six paces. The Safa has three high arches
and fourteen steps, the top one being wide like a stone bench.
It is surrounded by houses and is seventeen paces wide. Between
al-Safa and the green mil He what we shall mention. The mil
is a green column, dyed that colour, at the angle of the minaret
that is at the eastern corner of the Haram, on the upper part
of the torrent bed leading to al-Marwah, and to the left of
him who is performing the sa'i and (does the ritual running)
towards it. From this mil he will run, in doing the sa'i, to
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 123
two green mils, both being green columns after the style mentioned.
One of them is beside Bab 'Ali, in the wall of the
Haram and to the left of him who leaves the Gate; the other
faces it, in the wall of a house that adjoins the house of the
Emir Mukthir. At the top of both these columns, like a crown,
is set a tablet on which I found inscribed in gold characters:
'Al-Safa and al-Marwah are surely among the signs of God',
continuing the verse [Koran II, 158], and then following with:
'The servant of God and His Caliph Abu Muhammad al-
Mustadi bi Amri Ilah, Prince of the Faithful - may God glorify
his conquest - ordered the erection of this mil in the year 573
[A.D. 1177].'
Between al-Safa and the first (and single) mil are ninetythree
paces; and from this mil to the two mils is seventy-five
paces, which is the distance of the running, for coming and for
going, from the mil to the two mils, and from the two mils
to the mil. From the two mils to al-Marwah is three hundred
and twenty-five paces, and so the total number of paces of
him who does die sa'i from al-Safa to al-Marwah is four
hundred and ninety-three.
Al-Marwah has five steps, and is a large single arch of the
same width as al-Safa: seventeen paces. Between al-Safa and
al-Marwah lies the course of the torrent which to-day is a
market full of all the fruits and other things like grain and the
various kinds of foodstuffs. Those who are doing the sa'i can
hardly free themselves from the great crowd. The vendors'
stalls are right and left, the town having no organised market
save this, with the exception of those for the cloth and the
perfume merchants. These are at the Bab Banu Shayba, below
the market just mentioned, and so close to it as almost to touch it.
Over the noble Haram is Jabal [Mount] Abi Qubays, to the
east and facing the Black Stone corner. At its summit is a
blessed asylum for the needy, with a mosque, having a roof
which overlooks the Good City [Mecca]. From there is seen
its beauty, and the fairness and range of the Haram, and the
grace of the Holy Ka'bah rising in its midst. I read in Notes
124 THE TRAVELS OF LBN JUBAYR
on Mecca by Abu '1-Walid al-Azraqi that it was the first mountain
made by God, Great and Glorious is He, and that on it
was deposited the Black Stone at the time of the Flood. The
Quraysh called it al-Amiri [The Trustworthy] because it transmitted
the stone to Abraham-may God bless and preserve
him. On it is the tomb of Adam - God's blessings upon him. It is
one on the two great mountains of Mecca, the other being the
mountain contiguous with the mountain Qu'ayqi'an in the west.
We climbed Jabal Abu Qubays and prayed in its blessed
mosque. On it too is the place where stood the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him - when for him the moon clave
by the power of Great and Glorious God. Let this virtue and
blessedness suffice you. Virtue is in the hand of God, who gives
it to whom He wills, even to His inanimate creatures. There
is no God but He. At the top of the mountain are the remains
of a lofty stucco building which the Emir of the land, 'Isa,
the father of Mukthir, had taken as a stronghold, but which
the Emir of the 'Iraq pilgrimage, because of a dispute with
him, destroyed and left in ruins.
Outside the Bab al-Safa, and facing one of the two columns
in the Haram which we have mentioned (p. 87) as having
been erected to indicate the way the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him-took to al-Safa, is a column on which I
found inscribed: 'The servant of God, Muhammad al-Mahdi,
Prince of the Faithful - may God Most High have him in His
care-in the year 167 [A.D. 783] ordered the extension of the
Sacred Mosque on the side of the Bab al-Safa in order that
the Ka'bah might be in the centre of the Mosque.' This inscription
shows that the Holy Ka'bah is in the centre of the Mosque.
It was indeed thought that there had been a deviation towards
the Bab al-Safa, and we tested its blessed sides by measurement
and found the case to be true and in accordance with the content
of the inscription on the column. Under this inscription
and at the base of the column is another saying, 'The servant
of God, (Muhammad) al-Mahdi, Prince of the Faithful - may
God have him in His care - ordered the widening of the middle
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) I2J
gate which is between these two columns and is the road of the
Messenger of God - may God bless and preserve him - to al-
Safa.' At the top of the column which stands beside it there is
also an engraving which says: 'The servant of God, Muhammad
al-Mahdi, Prince of the Faithful - may God have him in His
care - ordered the restoration of the river-bed to the course it
held in the time of his father Abraham [his father by descent
through Ishmael] - may God bless and preserve him - and its
enlargement in the space around the Sacred Mosque, for the
convenience of the pilgrims to God's House and of those upon
the 'wmra/?.' Below this is written what also is written on the
first column concerning the widening of the middle gate.
The valley in question is that named after Abraham - may
God bless and preserve him - and its course was (once) by the
Bab al-Safa, but then the torrent took a different way and came
by the course between al-Safa and al-Marwah and entered the
Haram so that, at the time of the flooding from the rains, men
had to swim the tawaf of the Ka'bah. So al-Mahdi - God's
mercy on him - ordered the raising of a dam in the higher part
of the city, called Ra's al-Radm [the Peak of the Debris]; and
when the torrent comes, it turns from the dam to its (former)
course, passing the Bab Ibrahim to the place called al-Masfalah
[the Lower Part], and leaving the town. Thus no water runs
through the town except at the fall of large and continuous
rains. This is the valley to which the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - refers in the Koran [XIV, 37] when God -
may He be blessed and exalted - declares Abraham as saying,
'Our Lord! Surely I have settled part of my posterity in an
uncultivable valley.' Glory to God who preserves to Himself
signs palpable.
A note on Mecca - may God Most High exalt it - and
its noble monuments and honourable history
Mecca is a city set by Great and Glorious God amongst the
mountains that enclose it. It is in the bosom of a holy valley,
126 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
large and long, filled, with creatures so many that only Great
and Glorious God can count them. It has three gates, the first
being the Bab al-Ma'la [The Upper] from which one goes forth
to the blessed cemetery which is in the place called al-Hajun.
To the left of him who passes by it is a mountain, with at its
top a mountain pass having a sign like a tower where one comefc
out to the road of the 'Umrah [The Lesser Pilgrimage]. This
pass is known as Kada', and it is to it that Hassan refers when
he says in his poem:
'(The horses) raise the dust, and Kada is their meeting-place.'
The Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. - on the day
of his taking (of Mecca) said, 'Enter at the place of which
Hassan speaks,' and they entered by that pass.
The place called Hajun is the one referred to by al-Harith
ibn Mudad the Jurhumite when he says:
'As if between al-Hajun and al-Safa there is no living soul,
and in Mecca no talk o' nights. Ah but we were its people,
and we rendered null the vicissitudes of the night and the
distressful misfortunes.'
In the cemetery (at Hajun) are the burial places of many of
the Companions of the Prophet, of the followers of the Companions,
and of saints and men of piety, whose blessed shrines
have perished, and whose names have gone from the people
of the town. Here is the place in which al-Hajjaj ibn Yusifmay
God requite him - crucified the body of 'Abdullah the
son of al-Zubayr - may God have them both in His favour.
At this place to this day are the clear remains of a tall building
which was destroyed by the people of al-Ta'if in vexation at
the repeated curses (which it evoked from the pilgrim visitors)
of their fellow townsman Hajjaj. To your right, as you face
the cemetery, is a mosque in a gully between two hills. It is
said to be the mosque in which the jinn [genii] acknowledged
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and so gained
honour and distinction. At this Gate [al-Ma'la] starts the road
to Ta'if and to 'Iraq as well as the ascent to 'Arafat. God grant
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 127
that we may be among those who succeed in standing on it.
This Gate lies between the east and the north, mclining to the
east. Then the Bab al-Masfal [The Lower]. It is on the south
side and from it goes the road to the Yemen. Through it
entered Khalid ibn al-Walid - may God hold him in His favour
- the day of the taking of Mecca (by Muhammad). Then
comes the Bab al-Zahir, also called Bab al-'Umrah. It is on
the west, and from it goes the road to the City [Medina] of
the Messenger - May God bless and preserve him-and to
Syria and to Jiddah. From it one passes to al-Tan'im, the first
(ritual) place of meeting on the lesser pilgrimage. To come to
it from the Haram one leaves by the Bab al-'Umrah (in the
Haram) and so this (town) Gate bears the same name.
Al-Tan'im is a parasang away from Mecca on a fine broad
road with wells of sweet water called al-Shubaykah. As you
leave the city, at the distance of a mile, you will find a mosque
beside which is a stone placed on the road like a bench, and
overtopping it and leaning against it is another stone with an
inscription whose characters have become effaced. It is reported
that it is the place where the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - sat and rested when he returned from the lesser
pilgrimage. Men win blessings by kissing it and smoothing
their cheeks against it, as indeed they should in duty, and they
lean against it that their bodies might receive blessings by its
contact. After this place, at the distance of a bow-shot, you
will find, on the side of the road and to the left of him going
towards the 'umrah, two tombs piled high with heaps of large
stones. It is said that they are the tombs of Abu Lahab and
his wife.63 God's curses on them. From old times on, men have
not ceased the custom of stoning them, until now they are
covered by two large mountains.
From here, after a mile, you come to al-Zahir, which is built
on both sides of the road and has houses and gardens. All are
the property of a Meccan. Places for bathing and drinking have
been made for those performing the 'umrah. At the side of the
road is a long bench on which is a row of (drinking) mugs,
n8 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and there are tubs or qasari [Gr. yacrrpoc], filled with water
for the ritual ablutions. The place has a well of sweet water
from which they fill the bathing places mentioned above. The
pilgrim will find a great convenience for washing, ritual ablutions,
and drinking; and its founder is on the prosperous road
to reward and recompense (from God). Many others who seek
to acquire merit for the life to come help him in what he is
about. It is said that he obtains from it much advantage.
On the sides of the road at this part are four mountains, two
on this side and two on that, on which are cairns of stone. We
were told that they are the blessed mountains on which Abraham
- on whom be (eternal) happiness - placed pieces of birds and
then called to them, according to the declaration of Great and
Glorious God that Abraham had asked Him to show him how
He gave life to the dead [Koran II, 260]. Round those four
mountains are others, and some say that the mountains on which
Abraham put the birds were seven of these. God best knows.
When you have passed al-Zahir, you go by a valley known
as Dhu Tawa, in which it is said that the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve him - descended when he came into Mecca,
and that ('Abdullah) the sun of 'Umar-may God hold them
both in His favour - was bathing there at the time and thereupon
entered (with him). Round al-Zahir are some wells
called al-Shubaykah, and it has a mosque said to be that of
Abraham-on whom be (eternal) happiness. Ponder the blessedness
of this road, the many miracles attached to it, and the
holy relics that surround it.
You cross the valley and make towards a narrow pass from
which you go forth to come upon the signs put up as a partition
between the haram [sacred territory of Mecca] and the
hill [country unbound by the sacred prohibitions on carrying
arms, molesting game, fighting, etc.]. All that is within them
and on the side of Mecca is haram, and all beyond them hill.
They are like towers, big and small, placed in a row the one
close to the other. They begin at the top of the mountain which
stands on the right of the road of him who goes towards the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 129
'utnrah, cross the road, and so to the summit of the mountain
on his left. Here is the tniqat [appointed place] of the
pilgrims on the 'umrah, with mosques built of stone where they
pray, and here the pilgrims put on the ihram [pilgrim garb].
The mosque of'A'ishah - may God hold her in His favour - is
beyond these signs, at a distance of two bow-shots, and the
Malikis go out to it and there assume the ihram. But the Shafi'is
assume it at the mosques around the signs. In front of the
mosque of 'A'ishah-may God hold her in His favour-is
another dedicated to ' Ali ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him
in His favour.
A noteworthy thing shown us at the aforementioned Bab
Banu Shayba, was a threshold of large stones, long like a bench
and set before the three entrances of the Gate. "We were told
that they were idols worshipped by the Quraysh in the days
of ignorance [before Islam], the greatest of them being Hubal.
(Now) prostrate they He upon their faces, trampled on by men
and treated with the contempt of their slippers, unable to help
themselves much less their worshippers. Glory to Him who
is alone in His Oneness. There is no God but He. The truth
concerning these stones is that on the day of the taking of
Mecca, the Prophet-may God bless and preserve Himdirected
that the idols be broken and burnt, and that those
shown to us are not authentic. These at the door are merely
transported stones and are likened to the idols only because
of their size.
Amongst the famous mountains of Mecca, after Jabal Abu
Qubays is Jabal Hira'. It is to the east, about a parasang distant,
overlooking Mina, and its peak reaches high into the skies.
This is the blessed mountain to which the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve him-would often repair to worship, and
beneath it he shook (in emotion). The Prophet-may God
bless and preserve him - had said to it, 'Be calm, Hira', none
shall go over you save a prophet, a faithful one, and a martyr',
and indeed there were with him (at the time) Abu Bakr [surnamed
'The Faithful'] and 'Umar [murdered by a Persian] -
130 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
may God hold them in His favour. According to another
account (the Prophet said), 'Be firm. None shall go over you
save a prophet, a faithful one and two martyrs', and that
'Uthman [slain by rebels] was also with them. The first verse
of the Koran was revealed to the Prophet - may God hold him
in His favour-on this mountain which runs from west to
north. Behind its northern edge is the cemetery of Hajun that
we have already mentioned.
Mecca is walled only on the side of al-Ma'la where there is
a way into the city, on the side of al-Masfal where also there
is an entrance, and of Bab al-'Umrah. On the other sides there
are mountains, so for walls there is no need. The Walls of Mecca
are now destroyed, but traces remain and the Gates stand.
A note on some of the illustrious shrines of Mecca and its
holy relics
Mecca-may God exalt i t - i s all a noble shrine. Honour
enough for it is God's especially placing in it the August House,
and the prayers that anciently the Friend (of God) Abraham
made for it [Koran II, 126]. It is the Haram [sacred precinct]
of God, and His place of security. Enough that it is the place
of origin of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him -
whom God distinguished with honour and liberality, sending
with him the verses of the Koran and wise invocations. It is
the source of inspiration and revelation, and the first place
where the spirit of the faithful Jibril [Gabriel] descended. It
was the resort of the prophets of God and his noble apostles,
and also the birthplace of many of his Quraysh Companions,
the emigrants whom God made as lamps of religion and as
stars for those upon the right path.
Amongst the shrines that we observed was the chamber of
the prophetic inspiration in the house of Khadijah, the mother
of the Faithful - may God hold her in His favour - where the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - first went in to
his wife. In the same house also is a small chamber in which
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 131
was born Fatimah the virgin - may God hold her in His favour
- and here were bom the two Lords of the youth which
peoples heaven, al-Hasan and al-Husayn - may God have them
both in His favour. These holy places, which are locked and
guarded, were built in a manner fitting to them. Also amongst
its noble shrines is the birthplace of the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve him - and the undefiled ground that was the
first earth to touch his immaculate body and over which has
been built a mosque that never was seen more finely built,
being for the most of inlaid gold. The holy place where the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - came forth in the
blessed and happy hour of his nativity, a nativity ordained by
God in compassion for all the people, is girt with silver. What
earth to be honoured by God in making it the place of the
coming forth of the purest of bodies, the birthplace of the best
among men! May God bless and preserve him, his stock, his
family, and his noble Companions. This blessed place is opened,
and all men enter it to be blessed, on every Monday of the
month of Rabi' al-Awwal; for on that day and in that month
was born the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. All
the holy places mentioned are opened on that day, which is
always a famous one in Mecca.
Another of its noble shrines is the House of the Khayzuran,
where the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - worshipped
God in secret with the noble group of pioneers for
Islam, some of his Companions - may God hold them in His
favour - until God spread Islam from it by the hand of al-Faruq
[The Distinguisher between True and False] (the Caliph) 'Umar
ibn al-Khattab - may God hold him in His favour. This meritorious
attribute shall be enough. Another shrine is the house
of Abu Bakr the Faithful - may God be pleased with him -
which is now the Emir's mint.6* Opposite it is a wall containing
a blessed stone which brings benedictions on those who
touch it. It is said that it saluted the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - whenever he passed it, and there is a story
that one day he - may God bless and preserve him - came to
132 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the house of Abu Bakr - may God hold him in His favour -
and called him. But he was not there, and Great and Glorious
God gave voice to this stone which said, 'Oh Messenger of
God, he is not here.' This was one of the wondrous miracles
done for the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him.
Another holy place is the dome between al-Safa and al-
Marwah attributed to 'Umar ibn al-Khattab - may God hold
him in His favour - in whose centre is a well, and where it is
affirmed he - may God hold him in His favour - sat in judgement.
But the truth of this dome is that it was the dome of
his grandson, 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz - may God hold him
in His favour - and beside it is the house from which this takes
its name and where he sat in judgement during the days in
which he governed Mecca. So were we told by one of our
reliable sheiks. Men say that the well was anciently there, but
now there is none for we went into the place. We found it
paved and of elegant work.
Near to the house where we lodged, was the house of Ja'far
ibn 'Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour - of the Two
Wings.65 On the side of al-Masfal, which is the far part of the
town, is a mosque attributed to Abu Bakr the Faithful - may
God hold him in His favour - and girt with a lovely garden
having palm-trees, pomegranate and jujube trees, and we saw
there hinna' trees [Lawsonia inermis]. In front of the mosque
is a small house with a mihrab which, it is related, was a hidingplace
for Abu Bakr - may God hold him in His favour - from
the idolators who sought for him. Near the house of Khadijah
- may God hold her in His favour - and in the same by-street
as her honoured house, is a bench with a support to which
men repair to pray and to smooth its sides, for it is a place
where sat the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him.
Among the mountains which have honoured relics and august
shrines is the mountain called Abu Thawr, which is on the
Yemen side of Mecca, a parasang or more away. In it is the
cave in which the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him
-took refuge with his Companion, the Faithful One [Abu
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 133
Bakr] - may God hold him in His favour - as described by
God Most High in His Glorious Book [Koran IX, 40]. I read
in the work, Notes on Mecca, by Abu '1-Wahd al-Azraqi, that
the mountain called to the Prophet-may God bless and
preserve him-saying, 'To me, oh Muhammad, to me, oh
Muhammad, for I have given sanctuary to a prophet before
you.' On this mountain Great and Glorious God worked especially
for His prophet palpable miracles. In one of these the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - entered with his
Companion [Abu Bakr], a cleft in the rock two-thirds of a
span wide and a cubit deep. When they were at peace inside
it, God ordained that a spider should make its home over it,
and that a bird should build its nest and have its eggs therein.
The idolators arrived, led by a tracker who followed the footprints
on the road and stopped them at the cleft, and said,
'Here the footprints end. Your friend either ascended from
here to the skies, or was swallowed by the earth.' They looked
upon the spider spinning its web across the face of the cleft,
and the bird hatching its eggs, and saying, 'No one has entered
here,' they departed. Said the Faithful One - may God hold
him in His favour - 'Oh Messenger of God, had they got in
to us through the mouth of the cave what should we have
done' and the Apostle of God - may God bless and preserve
him - replied, 'Had they got in to us, we should have gone
forth from there,' and with his blessed hand he pointed to
the other side of the cave. In it there had been no cleft, but
on the instant, and by the power of Great and Glorious God,
there opened a door in its face. Glory to God who can
discharge that which He wishes.
Most men make several visits to this blessed cave, avoiding
entry by the door which Great and Glorious God had made
and seeking to enter through the cleft by which entry was
made by the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - that
they might be blessed thereby. He who attempts this lies down
upon the ground and lays his cheek beside the cleft. He first
puts in his head and hands and then manipulates the entrance
H
134 THE TRAVELb Or IJJN JUJJAYK.
of the rest of his body. Some there are who can do this from
the slenderness of their bodies; others get their bodies in the
middle of the cleft and there are gripped. They seek to go in
or to come out and cannot. Ensnared, they suffer distress and
wretchedness until, from behind, they undergo a violent pull.
Wise men avoid it for this reason, and more particularly for
another and humiliating reason, which is that the generality
of men believe that he who cannot fit it, and who is caught
by it and cannot escape, is not a child of lawful wedlock. This
story has so run upon their tongues that it has become with
them an absolute truth of which there is no doubt. He, therefore,
who is caught and fails to get through, must reckon with
bearing this shameful and mortifying thought, in addition to
what his body is suffering from the constriction of that narrow
place, from which because of pain he looks on death, cut short
of breath and afflicted by suffering. Some men quote the proverb,
'None but a thaur [ox, i.e. fool] would go up Jebel
Abu Thawr.'
Near to this cave on the same mountain, is a prop standing
out from the mountain, set in the form of a raised arm and
measuring half a man's height. At its top there extends what
is like a hand coming out from the arm by the power of Great
and Glorious God to be a sort of spreading pavilion under
which about twenty men can shade. It is called the Dome of
Gabriel - may God bless and preserve him.
One of the things that deserve to be confirmed and recorded
for the blessings and favour of seeing and observing it is that
on Friday the 19th of Jumada 1-Ula (579), which was the
9th of September [1183] God raised from the sea a cloud which
moved towards Damascus and rained heavily like an abundant
fountain, according to the words of the Messenger of God -
may God bless and preserve him [ibn al-Athir, Nihayah, 111,
p. 151]. It came at the ending of the afternoon's prayers and
with the evening of the same day, raining copiously. Men
hastened to the Hijr and stood beneath the blessed water-spout,
stripping off their clothes and meeting the water that flowed
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 135
from it with their heads, their hands, and their mouths. They
pressed round it in a throng, raising a great clamour, each one
coveting for his body a share of the divine mercy. Their prayers
went up, the tears of the contrite flowed, and you could hear
nothing but the swell of voices in prayer and the sobs of the
weeping. The women stood without the Hijr, watching with
weeping eyes and humble hearts, wishing they could go to that
spot. Some pilgrims listful of performing a meritorious act, and
moved as well to pity, drenched their clothes in the blessed
water and, going out to the women, wrung them into the
hands of some of them. They took it and drank it and laved
it over their faces and bodies.
This blessed cloud lasted until the evening and men continued
to flock that they might catch the water from the spout
with their hands, their faces, and their mouths, and sometimes
raised vessels that it might fall therein. It was an auspicious
evening, and our souls conceived that they had gained the
mercy pledged by His favour and bounty. It was auspicious
too for the conjuncture of blessed circumstances. One was that
it was the evening of Friday, a day above all others excellent
and on which we may hope that our prayers will be accepted
by God Most High, according to what has come to us from
true tradition. Another was that the gates of the skies opened
at the falling of the rain. Again, men were standing under the
Mizab [water-spout] which is one of the places where prayers
are answered, and their bodies were cleansed by His mercy
falling from His sky on to the roof of His Ancient House,
which corresponds with His House in the heavens. Let this be
enough of generous combinations and noble arrangement. God
granted that we should be amongst those who were cleansed
with this water from the impurities of their sins, and specially
endowed with favour, by the mercy of God Most High. The
mercy of God, Glorious is He, is wide, and encompasses His
erring servants, for He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate.
It is related that the imam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali prayed to
God Most High while he was in the noble Haram, making
136 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
some requests. These were in part granted by Great and Glorious
God, and in part denied. Of those denied was the falling of
rain during his stay in Mecca, for he wished to lave himself
with it under the Mizab, and pray to Great and Glorious God
at His noble House in the hour at which the gates of the sky
opened upon it. This was refused him, while all his other prayers
were answered. So praise and thanks to Him for what He has
bestowed upon us. May it be that one of His good servants on
the pilgrimage to His noble House will in particular be shown
by God His special favour, and that all we transgressors shall
be included in his intercessions. May God advantage us of the
mediations of the sincere among His servants, and leave us not
among those destitute of them. He is the great Benefactor.
A note on the favours and blessings which God Most
High has bestowed exclusively on Mecca
This blessed town and its peoples have from ancient times
profited from the prayers of the friend of God, Abraham, for
Great and Glorious God speaking for His friend-may God
bless and preserve him - has said, 'Therefore incline the hearts
of men to yearn towards them [i.e. the seed of Abraham living
in Mecca] and provide them with fruits; haply they may be
thankful' [Koran XIV, 37] and Himself has declared: 'Have
we not established for them a safe sanctuary [the sacred and
protected territory of Mecca] to -which products of all kinds
shall be brought' [Koran XXVIII, 57]. The proof of this in
Mecca is manifest, and will continue to the Day of Resurrection,
for the hearts of men yearn towards it from far countries
and distant regions. The road to it is a place of encounter for
those, coming and going, to whom the blessed claims (of Islam)
have reached. From all parts produce is brought to it, and it is
the most prosperous of countries in its fruits, useful requisites,
commodities, and commerce. And although there is no commerce
save in the pilgrim period, nevertheless, since people
gather in it from east and west, there will be sold in one day,
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 137
apart from those that follow, precious objects such as pearls,
sapphires, and other stones, various kinds of perfume such as
musk, camphor, amber and aloes, Indian drugs and other articles
brought from India and Ethiopia, the products of die industries
of'Iraq and the Yemen, as well as the merchandise of Khurasan,
the goods of the Maghrib, and other wares such as it is impossible
to enumerate or correctly assess. Even if they were spread
over all lands, brisk markets could be set up with them and all
would be filled with the useful effects of commerce. All this
is within the eight days that follow the pilgrimage, and exclusive
of what might suddenly arrive throughout the year from the
Yemen and other countries. Not on the face of the world are
there any goods or products but that some of them are in Mecca
at this meeting of the pilgrims. This blessing is clear to all, and
one of the miracles that God has worked in particular for
this city.
Concerning the foods, fruits, and other good things, we had
thought that Spain was especially favoured above all other
regions. So it was until we came to this blessed land and found
it overflowing with good things, and fruits such as figs, grapes,
pomegranates, quince, peaches, lemons, walnuts, palm-fruit,
water-melons, cucumbers, and all the vegetables like egg-plant,
pumpkin, carrot, cauliflower and other aromatic and sweetsmelHng
plants. Most of these vegetables, like the egg-plant,
cucumber, and water-melon are hardly ever cut off throughout
the year. This is one of the most remarkable of those things
we observed and which it would be too long to enumerate
and describe. All these various kinds of vegetable and fruit had
an excellence of taste greater than those of other lands, and
our surprise at that lasts long.
The choicest of the fruits we tried were the water-melon and
the quince. All its fruits are good, but the water-melon has a
particular and exceptional merit in that its odour is the most
fragrant of smells and the best. When someone approaches you
with one, you find the fragrant odour coming first to you so
that from the enjoyment of its sweetness you almost abstain
138 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
from eating it; and when you taste it, it seems to you like
sugar-candy or purest honey. It may be that the reader of these
words will think that in this description there is some hyperbole.
No, in the name of God it is more than I described, and
above what I said. Mecca has a honey better than that (called)
al-mahdi and which has become a proverb; they call it al-mas'udi.
The various kinds of milk are of the highest excellence, and
all butter made from it you can scarce distinguish from honey
for its goodness and sweetness.
A people from the Yemen called al-Saru bring to Mecca a
kind of raisin, the black and the red, of surpassing quality; and
with them they bring many almonds. Then there is the sugarcane
in plenty, brought from where they bring the vegetables
we have already mentioned. It has an ample stock of imported
sugar and all the good things and best of commodities. Praise
be to God. As to confectionery, they make all kinds of unusual
forms of it, with honey and thickened sugar in many shapes,
including imitations of all the fruits, fresh and dry. In the three
months of Rajab, Sha'ban, and Ramadan, the ground is spread
with these foods between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and no one
has seen a more perfect sight either in Egypt or anywhere else.
From them are shaped human and fruit-like forms displayed
on pedestals like brides on nuptial thrones, ornamentally disposed
in their coloured variety and appearing like beautiful
flowers, which fix our looks and ask the dirham and the dinar
to abdicate (their supremacy of brilliance). As for the meat in
Mecca, it is wonderful. The statement falls from all who move
across the horizons and traverse the regions of the earth, that
it is the best meat they have ever eaten in it. This, though God
knows best, cannot come save from the goodness of its pastures.
And it is despite the excess of fat, such that were it meat
of another land reaching such a degree of fat a man would
spit it from his mouth, rejecting it and casting it aside. But
here the opposite is the case, the fatter it is, the more appetising
and acceptable it is, and you will find it so tasty and tender
that it will melt in the mouth before you bite it, and for its
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) 139
lightness be speedily digested by the stomach. I do not look at
this save as one of the rare attributes and blessings of the protected
land whose welfare has, beyond a peradventure, been
assured, and the tale of which is less than the reality. May God
with His power and glory, provide sustenance for those (who
have come to it from) yearning for His sacred town, and
longing for the august sight and the venerable rites.
The fruits are brought to Mecca from al-Ta'if, which is three
days from it, going gently and easily, and from the villages
around it. The nearest of these places is called Udum, which
is a day's journey or less from Mecca and, lying in the valley
of Ta'if, comprises many villages. Also there is Barn Marr,
which is a day or less away, and Nakhlah the same distance,
and the valleys near the town like 'Ayn Sulayman and others.
To Mecca God brought from the Maghrib men skilled in tillage
and husbandry who created in it gardens and sown lands,
and they are one of the reasons for the fertility of these lands.
All this is from the bounty of Great and Glorious God and by
reason of His generous care for His noble Haram and protected
town. One of the most remarkable fruits we found and enjoyed
eating, and whose merits, particularly as we had never before
met them, we began to extol, were the fresh dates, which with
them take the place of (our) green figs. They are plucked and
eaten off the tree, and are so good and so delicious that one
cannot weary of eating them. The time of their maturity is
a great occasion with these people, who go out to them as if
going forth to a country property, or like the people of the
Maghrib leaving for their farms at the time of the ripening of
the fig and vine. When this is over, and the maturing is complete,
they are spread upon the ground for time enough for
them to dry a little. They then are heaped on each other in
baskets and jars, and laid up in store.
Amongst the good works and general favours of God on
our behalf, was that on arriving at this honoured city we found
that all the settled pilgrims there, those who had come before
or whose stay there had been long, spoke as a matter of wonder
140 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR.
at its freedom from the thieves who (once) had robbed the
pilgrims, snatching what was in their hands, and being a plague
in the noble Haram. No one could neglect his belongings the
twinkling of an eye or they would be taken from his hand or
girdle with amazing cunning and astonishing smoothness, for
there was not one of them but was light of hand. But this
year, save in a few cases, God gave protection against their
ill-doing, and the Emir of the land showed severity towards
them, wherefore their evil ceased.
In this year were combined mildness of weather, a mitigation
of the customary heat of the summer, and an abatement
of the fierceness of the samum [the notorious hot wind]. We
passed the nights on the roof of the place where we stayed,
and sometimes the cold of the night air would fall on us, and
we would need a blanket to protect us from it; this was a
strange thing for Mecca. The pilgrims also spoke of the many
goods in Mecca this year, and the mildness of their prices,
which was contrary to their earlier experience. The price of
wheat was one mu'mini dinar for four sa, which is two awbahs
[one awbah=s bushels] in the weight system of Egypt and its
provinces. Two awbahs are equal to two and a half qadahs of
the Maghrib measure. This price in a land that has no farms,
and no source of sustenance for its people save the provisions
imported to it, is one in which the aid and favour of God is
manifest. It is the more so in view of the many pilgrims settled
there this year, and the succession of men coming into it. I was
told by more than one of the pilgrims who had been settled
there long years that never had they seen there such a concourse,
nor had they ever heard of such. May God, by His
favour, grant to this multitude His compassion and safe-keeping.
The pilgrims did not cease, the one after the other, to describe
the conditions of this year and to compare them with preceding
years. They even declared that the blessed water of
Zamzam had become more palatable, and that before it had
not been of this purity. A singular feature of this water is that
when you drink it on its issuing forth from the bottom of the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (579) HI
well you find it, to the sense of taste, like milk coming from
the udders of a camel. In this miracle of God Most High is
evidence of His care and blessing that needs no description.
'It serves the purpose for which it is drunk' [see note 50], as
said the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. 'God, with
His grace and favour, granted that all who thirst for it should
drink therefrom'. One of the tried effects of this blessed water
is that if perchance a man should feel a touch of sickness or
languor of the limbs, either from many circumambulations (of
the Ka'bah) or from the performance on foot of the lesser
pilgrimage or for other reasons causing fatigue, and pours this
water on his body, he will on the instant find relief and be
enlivened and that which afflicts him will pass away.
The Month ofjumada 'l-Akhirah (579)
[21st of September-I9th of October, 1183]
May God show us His grace and favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of "Wednesday
the 21st of September, according to the foreigners,
while we were still in the Holy Haram-may God increase
its grandeur and honour. On the morrow of that night the
Emir Mukthir came (to the Haram) with his followers and
attendants in the manner we described in the month ofjumada
1-Ula and with the same procedure. The Zamzam muezzin
sang his praises and prayed for him on the dome of the Zamzam
well, raising his voice in invocation and commendation as the
Emir made each circuit (of the Ka'bah). The Koran readers
walked before him until he had finished the tawaf, and was on
his way to depart. At the beginning of each month of the year,
all the peoples of these eastern parts follow a pleasing practice.
They shake hands, congratulate each other, pray for God's forgiveness
the one on behalf of the other, and pray for each other;
and so they always do at the festivals. This happy custom instils
into the spirit a renewed sincerity and invokes the mercy of
Great and Glorious God, with the Faithful shaking each others'
hands and the blessings of the prayers they have made for each
other. The Muslim communion is under the mercy of God,
and its prayers have a place with Him.
This blessed city has two baths; one named after the jurisprudent
al-Mayanishi, one of the lecturing sheiks in the venerable
Haram, and the other which is the larger, named after
Jamal al-Din who, like his name, was indeed the splendour of
religion. In Mecca and Medina - may God exalt them - there
are to be seen his - may God's mercy rest upon his soul - noble
monuments, his praiseworthy works, and the strongly made
cisterns done in God's name, such as no one before him had
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (579) 143
ever done, not even the greatest of the Caliphs, much less the
Viziers. He - may God's mercy rest upon his soul - had been
vizier to the Lord of Mosul and long had prosecuted these high
designs, embracing all things useful to the Muslims both in the
Haram of God Most High, and in that of His Messenger - may
God bless and preserve him. For fifteen years and more he
ceased not to give lavishly and beyond count of his substance,
building in Mecca quarters dedicated to charitable and pious
ends, inalienably and in perpetuity, making reservoirs, placing
on the high roads wells where rainwater could collect, and
restoring the remains of buildings in the two noble Harams.
One of the noblest of his actions was the bringing of water to
Mount 'Arafat; and he engaged the Bedouin tribe of Banu
Shu'bah, who lived in those regions from which the water was
brought, that on payment to them of a large allowance, they
should not cut the water from the pilgrims. But when he died
- may God's mercy rest upon his soul - they returned to their
culpable practice of cutting it. Among his generous acts and
achievements was the placing of the City [Medina] of the
Apostle - may God bless and preserve him - under the shelter
of two strong walls, on which he spent immeasurable wealth.
But among the most wonderful of the works in which God
Most High helped him to success was his restoring of all the
doors of the Haram, and the door of the Ka'bah which he
covered with silver gilt and which is the one there now and
the one we have already described [p. 78]. He clothed the
blessed lintel in a sheet of pure gold, which also we have
described. The old door he took, and directed that from it
should be made a coffin for him to be buried in. When his
death drew nigh, he enjoined that he should be put into that
blessed coffin and sent in it on the pilgrimage, he being dead.
He was taken to 'Arafat, and at a certain distance from it the
coffin was uncovered, and when the pilgrims performed the
ifadah [the ritual 'return' from Mina] they made it with him.
All the rites were observed for him, including the tawafo£ the
ifadah. He - may God's mercy rest upon his soul - had never
i44 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
in his lifetime done the pilgrimage. After this he was carried
to the City [Medina] of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - where were the noble monuments of his which
we have mentioned, and where the Sharifs almost carried him
on their heads. A mausoleum was built for him beside that of
the Chosen One - may God bless and preserve him - and in it
was opened a window looking on the holy mausoleum of the
Prophet. This was conceded him, despite the extreme reluctance
in making such privileges, in token of his bounteous deeds,
and in that mausoleum he was buried. God made him happy
with that noble vicinage, granting him in particular a sepulchre
in that holy and illustrious earth. In truth God does not fail
to reward those who do good. We shall mention the date of
his death when, if Great and Glorious God so wills, we come
to the date inscribed on his tomb. God is He who can confer
easement, there is no Lord but He. This man-may God's
mercy rest upon his soul - has to his name splendid monuments
and glorious acts which have not been excelled by the most
munificent, or the most eminent of the bountiful of former
times. They are beyond count and exceed all praise, and
throughout the length of time shall be accompanied by the
voices of men in prayer.
Let it be enough to tell you that his care extended to the
repair of all the roads of the Muslims in eastern parts, from
'Iraq to Syria and to the Hejaz, as we have said, and that he
dug wells, built cisterns, founded hostelries in the deserts with
orders that they be furnished as a place of rest for the sons of
the road [poor travellers] and indeed for all travellers, built
inns in the cities between 'Iraq and Syria, and appointed them
for the lodging of those poor sons of the road who could not
pay the account, assigning to these inns and hostelries a staff
who should administer to their needs. This he ordained in perpetuity,
and these noble requests remain until this day, so that
travellers upon the way speak handsomely of this man, and
the horizons are filled with his praises. During his lifetime in
Mosul, as we were told by more than one of those pilgrim
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (579) 145
merchants deserving of credence who witnessed it, he maintained
a large and generous board which was open daily to all
strangers that they might take their fill of food and drink; and
under his shade the poor sons of the road who came and went
found wholesome sustenance. So it continued through his life
- may God's mercy rest upon his soul. His monuments are
enduring, and his fame is ever renewed upon the tongues of
men. Praised and happy he died; and for the happy, an honoured
remembrance means continuous life or a second period of existence.
God will ensure the reward of those who do good to
His servants. He is the most generous of the generous, and the
most certain of guarantors.
Amongst the things prohibited in this noble Haram - may
God exalt and honour it - is (private) disbursement on it, and
no rich man may restore a building or build a hatim or anything
else connected with the blessed Haram for the purpose of
gaining a heavenly reward. If it were lawful to do so, the
wealthy who wished to spend on acts of piety would make
its walls of gold and its floors of amber, but this they may
not do. When one of the great men of the world seeks to
restore any of its monuments or any of its noble remains,
he must gain permission of the Caliph, and if it is something
that may be engraved or inscribed upon, the name of the Caliph
will be traced on it with a statement that it was done at his
command. Of the name of the benefactor, no mention will be
made. Furthermore, a large portion of the bequest must inevitably
go to the Emir of the country, and this sometimes is equal
to the whole of the original gift, so that the expense must be
doubled for the owner that the object might be achieved.
One of the strangest things happened to a shrewd foreigner,
a man of wealth and property, who came to the venerated
Haram in the time of the grandfather of the present emir,
Mukthir, and saw the orifice of the well of Zamzam and its
dome to be not of a fashion that pleased him. He met with
the Emir and said to him, 'I wish to undertake the careful
reconstruction of the orifice of the Well of Zamzam and its
\\G THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
brick casing, and to restore the dome, bringing them to the
highest possible limit (of perfection) and lavishing upon them
the bulk of my fortune. One condition I lay upon you, and
on your observance of it depends the attainment of the purpose.
It is that you appoint on your behalf a man holding your
confidence who shall record the amounts spent in this matter.
Then, when the building is completed and, the expenditure
being over, the reckoning is made, a like sum shall be paid to
you in requital of the consent you gave me.' Filled with greed,
the Emir exulted, for he knew that according to the description
given him, the cost would reach thousands of dinars. He
gave his approval, and attached to the man a registrar who
should record all expenses, great and small. And so the man
began his work, applying himself with the greatest assiduity,
and exhausting all efforts to obtain by his work the favour of
Great and Glorious God and 'to lend Him a goodly loan' [i.e.
one without interest: Koran II, 245, and LVII, 11]. The registrar
recorded everything in his books and the Emir supervised
what he wrote, expecting to take with wide-stretched hands
that handsome sum. At last the construction was completed
and brought to the style we described earlier in our account
of the Well of Zamzam and its dome. When nothing remained
but to present the account to the author of the scheme and
demand of him the sum agreed upon, he left the place and
entered into the past tense. He rode throughout the night, and
with the morning the Emir 'began to wring his hands' [Koran
XVIII, 42] and beat his breast, but since the building was placed
in the Haram of God Most High, he could do nothing to change
or remove it. The man gained his reward, and at his death
God undertook his care, granting him a fair sanctuary. 'Whatsoever
you spend (for good), He replaceth it. He is the best
of Providers' [Koran XXXIV, 39]. The story of this man with
the Emir men continued to tell one another for its strangeness
and wonder, and all who drink of the blessed water offer
prayers on his behalf.
The Month of Rajah the Unique (S79)
[20th of October-i8th of November, 1183]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon of the month rose on the night of Thursday
the 20th of October, according to the testimony of a great
number of mujawir [settled] pilgrims and Sharifs of Mecca,
who declared that they had seen it on the road of the 'umrah,
and from Jabal Qu'ayqi'an, and from Jabal Abu Qubays, and
who recorded their testimony before the Emir and the qadi.66
No one had seen it from the sacred mosque. This blessed month
is held by the people of Mecca to be a solemn time of meeting
of the pilgrims, and is their greatest festival. They have
not ceased to observe it in times both ancient and modern,
each generation inheriting it from the one before, uninterruptedly
from the days of ignorance [i.e. before Muhammad].
They then called it munsil al-asinnah, because it was one of the
sacred months during which fighting was unlawful. It is the
month of God (called) al-Asamm, 'The Deaf, according to
the tradition concerning the Apostle of God - may God bless
and preserve him. The 'umrah of Rajab is the equivalent of
the 'Standing' on 'Arafat, for they throng to it in multitudes,
the like of which has not been heard of. The people of
adjacent countries flock to it, so great a number assembling
that none could count them but Great and Glorious God.
Those who have not witnessed this occasion in Mecca have not
seen a sight that asks to be recorded for its strangeness and
wonder.
In this regard we observed something it is impossible to
describe, concerning the night on which the new moon rises,
and the morning that follows. Preparations are made for this
days before, and we observed something of it that we shall
briefly describe. On the afternoon of Wednesday at whose
148 THE TRAVELS Of IxJN JUUAYK.
eventide the new moon was expected, we saw the streets and
by-ways of Mecca to be filled with hawdaj [dome-shaped camel
howdahs] bound to the camels and covered with various silk
drapings, and other trappings of fine linen, according to the
circumstances and affluence of their owners, all of whom gave
to it all the care and attention that was in their power. They
set forth to Tan'im, the (ritual) place of assembly for those
going on the 'umrah, the hawdaj flowing through the valleys
and mountain tracks of Mecca. The camels beneath them were
adorned with all kinds of ornaments, and set forth to the sacred
places without guidance in collars of silk and other materials
that were comely to look upon. Sometimes the drapings on
the hawdaj fell so low as to draw their hems along the ground.
The most remarkable of these hawdaj that we noticed were
that of the Sharifah Jumanah, daughter of Fulaytah and aunt
of the Emir Mukthir, which drew a long train over the ground,
and those of the harem of the Emir and the harem of his principal
officers, as well as other hawdaj whose number we cannot
record because of the impossibility of counting them. On the
backs of the camels these hawdaj appeared as raised pavilions,
and the beholder would conceive them to be an encampment
with its pitched tents of every lively colour. There was no one
of the people of Mecca and the mujawir [settled pilgrims] who
that Thursday night did not go forth on the 'umrah, and we
were among those who went, being earnestly desirous of
acquiring the blessings of that solemn night.
We ourselves were hardly able to reach the Mosque of
'A'ishah, because of the press of men and the blocking of the
narrow parts of the way by the hawdaj. Fires were lit throughout
the road on both its sides, and lighted torches preceded
the camels carrying the hawdaj of the secluded ladies of Mecca
to whom we have referred. When we had done the 'umrah,
fulfilled the tawaf, and come to the sa 1 between al-Safa and
al-Marwah, a part of the night had passed, and we saw the
course to be wholly lit with fires and lanterns and thronged
with men and women performing the ritual in their hawdaj.
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) 149
We could not get through save between the hawdaj and the
legs of the camels, because of the press and the cofiidings of
the hawdaj the one with the other. We witnessed the most
remarkable night of the nights of this world, and he who has
not seen it has not seen a thing wonderful to talk of, than which
there is nothing more marvellous to remind him of the gathering
at the day of resurrection, so great is the multitude of
people, dressed in pilgrim garb, crying 'Labbayka' [Here am
I, O Lord] [see note 46] and invoking and beseeching Great
and Glorious God. The venerated mountains that flanked the
road answered them with their echoes until the ears were
deafened; and at awe of that sight tears flowed and hearts
melted in emotion.
That night the Sacred Mosque was filled with brightly shining
lamps. When the seeing of the new moon had been proven
before the Emir, he ordered the beating of tymbals and drums
and the sounding of trumpets as a sign that it was the night of
the festival. When the morning of that night of Thursday came,
he set forth on the 'umrah with a vast concourse the like of
which has never been heard of. The people of Mecca collected
round him to the last person, and went forth according to their
ranks, tribe by tribe, quarter by quarter, bristling with weapons,
on horse and on foot, assembling in numbers too numerous
to count. He who beheld them would marvel at their
exceeding number, and if they had come from many lands
it yet would be a wonder. How then when they were from
one city! It is the proof of proofs of the blessedness of that
city.
They set forth in admirable order; the cavaliers left on their
horses and playing with their weapons, while the foot leaped
upon each other vying in skill-at-arms. They carried spears,
swords, and targes, and appeared to pierce with the spear, strike
with the sword, and defend with the targe with which they
protected themselves, revealing all manner of marvels in their
skilful contests. They hurled their spears into the air, and
hastened after them to catch them in their hands, although at
1
i^o THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
times the course of the weapons brought them on to their
heads, they being in such a press that they had no chance to
manoeuvre. Some on occasions threw their swords into the air
and caught them by the hilt as if they had never left their hands.
(This continued) until the Emir came forth with solemn step,
surrounded by his officers, and led by his sons who were near
to being young men, and by waving banners and tymbal and
drum. An air of calmness lay upon him. The mountains, roads,
and paths were filled with the mujawir who had come to view
the scene. The Emir came to the place of assembly, performed
his mission, and then began his return. The two troops of horsemen
were disposed before him, playing and making merry,
while the footmen wheeled around in the manner described.
A party of Bedouin rode well-bred camels free from blemish;
a finer sight could not be seen. The riders of these camels raced
with the horsemen before the Emir, raising their voices in
invocations and praise for him, until they came to the Sacred
Mosque. There he circumambulated the Ka'bah, led by the
Koran reciters, while the Zamzam muezzin warbled on the
terrace of the Zamzam Dome raising his voice in wishing him
joy of the feast, lauding him, and praying for him according
to the custom.
When the Emir had finished the circumambulation, he prayed
at the Multazam, and then went to the maqam and prayed
behind it. It had been brought out from the Ka'bah for him
and placed inside the wooden dome behind which prayers are
said. When he had ended his prayers, the dome was raised for
him from off the maqam, which he kissed and touched. The
dome was then replaced and he began to leave by Bab al-Safa
towards the mas'a [place of the ritual course], the people
crowding before him. He performed the sai on horseback,
with his officers around him and his foot spearmen before
him. When he had done the sai, swords were drawn before
him and he was encompassed by his followers, and in this
imposing state, followed by the multitude, he returned to
his dwelling. All that day die mas'a billowed with men and
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) XJI
women performing the ritual course (between al-Safa and
al-Marwah).
On the second day, which was Friday, the road was nigh
as crowded as on the day before, with horsemen and pedestrians,
and men and women. The women who walked in the hope of
a heavenly reward were many, and they competed with the
men on that blessed way. May God, by His favour, hear the
prayers of them all. During all this, the men met and shook
hands, offering prayers and praying for God's forgiveness each
on behalf of the other, while the women did likewise. AH wore
their finest clothing, adorning themselves after the fashion of
the people of the land on their days of festival. As for the population
of the Safe City [Mecca], this meeting of the pilgrims
is the festival for which they make (great) preparation, and
assemble in large numbers, contending in magnificence and
indulging in much ceremony. There is much activity in the
markets at this time, and sales are brisk; foreseeing this, they
make provision for it months before.
Amongst the benevolent acts of Great and Glorious God
towards them at this time, and revealing the bounteous care
that He - may He be exalted - bestows on His Safe Haram (is
the following). A Yemenite tribe called al-Saru, who people
an impregnable mountain in the Yemen called Sarat - connected
it might be with Sarat al-rijal [noble men], as I was
told by a jurisprudent from the Yemen named Ibn Abi 1-Sayf,
the people deriving this name from the land they live in - and
who are divided in sub-tribes like the Bajilah and others, prepare
themselves to arrive at this Blessed City ten days before
the festival combining the aims of performing the lesser pilgrimage,
and of provisioning the land with various kinds of
foods such as wheat and other grains, and even kidney-beans
and lesser-esteemed products, and bringing to it butter, honey,
raisins, and almonds, their stock comprising wheat, condiments,
and fruits. They arrive in thousands, men and camels, laden
with the goods we have described, and bringing an abundance
of viands to the people of the City and to the pilgrims who
152 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
have settled there, so that they are well nourished and sustained.
Prices are lowered, and commodities are everywhere to be
found, and the people take from them what will last them
for a year and until the next provisioning. But for this provisioning
the population of Mecca would lead a miserable
life.
A curious fact concerning these victuallers is that they do
not sell any of the things we have mentioned for dinars or
dirhams, but exchange them for cloths, 'abat and shimal [kinds
of cloaks]. The Meccans prepare these for them, together with
women's veils and strong quilts, and similar things such as are
worn by the Bedouin, and thus they buy and sell from them.
It is related that when these Saru remain in their own country
and do not bring provisions, they are afflicted with a drought
and death visits their flocks and herds, but when they come
with them their land produces a bountiful harvest, and blessings
are shed on their substance. So when the time for departure
draws nigh and there has been some carelessness in preparation,
the women collect and drive them from their houses. All this
is from the goodness of God Most High for the protection of
the Safe City [Mecca].
The country of the Saru, as was told to us, is fertile and
extensive, abounding in figs and vines, and having broad cultivations
and rich crops. They are firmly persuaded that their
prosperity is wholly due to these provisions that they bring,
and in this too they enjoy a profitable commerce with Great
and Glorious God. These people are pure Arab, and eloquent
of speech. They are brusque and robust, and have not been
nourished by the comforts of city life, nor have they been
polished by the urban manner. The religious laws do not direct
them in their affairs, and you will find among them no devotionary
practices beyond that of good intention. When they
compass the Holy Ka'bah, they throw themselves upon it as
do children upon a loving mother, seeking shelter beside her.
They cling to its curtains, and wherever their hands grasp them,
they tear from the violence of their dragging and their throwing
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) 153
themselves upon them. Meanwhile their tongues give sonorous
prayer, such as to break the heart and cause the hard
eye to flow copious tears. You will see men standing around
them, hands outstretched, saying 'Amen' to their prayers and
repeating those prayers after them. Throughout the time of
their stay, it is impossible to perform the tawaf with, them, or
find a way to kiss the Black Stone.
When the noble door is opened, they enter 'in salute', and
you will observe that in making their entry they form a chain
as if tied the one to the other. They are linked together in this
fashion up to thirty or forty or even more, and the chains thus
formed follow the one after the other. At times it happens that
someone breaks off and falls from the blessed stairway that leads
to the noble House, and all fall with him so that the looker-on
will observe a spectacle that will provoke his laughter. As for
their prayers, no more pleasant drollery of the Bedouin is told
than of them. They face the noble House and prostrate themselves
in prayer without performing a rak'ah,67 and pray very
rapidly. Some make one prostration, some two, three, and
four, then raise their heads a little from the ground, on which
their palms are spread, and turn to right and left like one in
fear. They then recite the taslim [the closing benediction: 'The
peace and mercy of God be with you'] or rise without saying
it, or without assuming the attitude for the tashahhud [the
testimony of faith: 'I testify that there is no deity but God,
and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God'].
Sometimes they converse during this, and at times during his
prostrations one will raise his head to his companion and,
calling to him, lay some charge to him. as he wills, and
then return to his prostrations. And so they go on with their
odd ways.
They wear no habit save a dirty wrapping or a skin with
which they cover themselves. With all this they are a brave
and vigorous people. They have a large Arab bow resembling
the bow used for teasing cotton, which never leaves them
on their journeys. When they set forth to visit the holy places,
154 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the Bedouin on the way who are wont to prey upon the
pilgrims fear their boldness and avoid encountering them,
leaving the road clear to them. The pilgrims making the visit
accompany them and praise their company, for despite our
description of their habits they are a people who believe sincerely
in the Faith. It is said that the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - spoke of them and praised them nobly saying,
'Teach them the ritual of the prayers, and they will teach
you how to pray (from the heart).' Let it suffice that they are
included in all his sayings - may God bless and preserve him -
from 'The Faith is Yemenite' to those other traditions that have
come down concerning the Yemen and its people. It is said
that 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar - may God hold him in his favour -
esteemed the time in which they made their circumambulation
and sought to enter among them that he might partake of the
blessings won by their prayers. Everything in their regard is
indeed remarkable.
In the Hijr we saw one of their boys sitting beside a pilgrim
who was teaching him the opening surah [Chapter] of the
Koran, and the surah of The Unity [CXII]. The pilgrim pronounced
the words, 'Say: He, Allah, is One', and the boy said,
'Allah is One.' The teacher repeated it to him and the boy
replied: 'Did you not tell me to say "He, Allah, is One"?
Well, I have said it.' The pilgrim was hard put to it to make
him understand, and only after much difficulty hung the words
on the boy's tongue. He then recited, 'In the name of God,
the Beneficent, the Merciful. Praise be to God, Lord of the
Universe,' and the boy answered, 'In the name of God, the
Beneficent, the Merciful. And praise be to God ' The teacher
repeated it to him, and added, 'Do not say, "And praise be to
God," but say only, "Praise be to God." ' Then said the lad,
'When I have said, "In the name of God, the Beneficent, the
Merciful," I say, "And praise be to God" to give the conjunction.
If I had not first said, "In the name of God," and was
beginning with this part I should then say, "Praise be to God." '
We marvelled at the affair of this boy, and his natural knowledge
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) 155
of the joining and separation of language, being without
schooling. Their eloquence is most remarkable, and their prayers
greatly move the soul. May God, by His favour, prosper their
affairs and those of all His servants.
The 'umrah lasts throughout this month, night and day, and
is celebrated both by men and women, but the general assembly
takes place only on the first night (of the month), which is
the night of their great festival.
The noble House is opened daily in this blessed month, but
on the 29th it is reserved especially for women, and on that
day they appear in Mecca in great multitudes. It is their famous
day of festival, for which they make (great) preparation. On
Thursday the 15th of this month we witnessed a concourse for
the 'umrah that was almost equal to the first, which we spoke
of at the beginning of the month, and there was not a man or
woman but went forth to it. In a word, all this blessed month
is attended by various forms of devotional practices such as the
'umrah and other ceremonies, and a particular attention is paid
to its beginning and middle part as well as to the twentyseventh
day.
On the evening of this aforementioned Thursday, we were
sitting in the venerated Hijr when suddenly we saw the Emir
Mukthir appear in pilgrim garb. He had just come from the
place of meeting for the 'umrah, being wishful of winning
the blessings of that day, and also of discharging its rites.
Behind him came his sons, also in the pilgrim garb, and some
of his retinue encompassed him. At once the Zamzam muezzin
hastened to the roof of the Zamzam dome and made his customary
invocations, taking turns in this with his younger
brother. The evening prayers were at hand at the time the
Emir ended his tawaf, so he prayed behind the Shafi'ite imam,
and then left to the blessed mas'a.
On Friday the 16th of the month a large pilgrim caravan of
about four hundred camels left with the Sharif al-Da'udi to
visit (the tomb of) the Apostle of God - may God bless and
preserve him. In the preceding month of Jumada '1-Thaniyah
156 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
there had also been another visit by certain pilgrims in a
smaller caravan than this. There remained to be done the
visit of the month of Shawwal, and that with the pilgrims
from 'Iraq after the 'standing' (on Mount 'Arafat), if it
pleased Great and Glorious God. On the 19th of Sha'ban,
this large caravan returned in peace and safety. Praise be to
God.
On the night of Tuesday the 27th of this same month of
Rajah, the people of Mecca again appeared in a vast concourse,
going forth on the 'umrah in numbers not less than on the first
occasion. Men and women all poured forth to it that night in
the style and manner we have already described, in order that
they might gain the blessings of the grace of that night, for it
is one of the nights famous for grace. In its morning hour it
was remarkable for the great host of people and for the splendid
spectacle it presented. May God render this pleasing before His
noble countenance.
This 'umrah they call the 'Umrah of the Hill [Akamah],
because during it they wear the pilgrim garb as from the hill
that rises before the mosque of 'A'ishah - may God hold her
in His favour-about a bow-shot distant from it. It is close
to the mosque dedicated to 'Ah - upon whom be eternal peace.
According to them, the origin of this 'umrah of the hill was
due to the fact that when 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr - may God
hold them both in His favour - completed the rebuilding of
the Ka'bah he went forth barefooted to perform the 'umrah,
accompanied by the Meccans, and came to this hill, where he
donned the pilgrim garb. That was on the 27th of Rajab. He
made his way through the pass of al-Hajun that leads to al-
Ma'la [Upper Mecca], where the Muslims entered the day they
conquered Mecca, as we have already mentioned. This 'umrah
became an established observance for the Meccans, on that same
day and at that same hill. That day of 'Abdullah - may God
hold him in His favour - is celebrated, for on it he offered sacrificial
victims of a number that cannot be truly established,
although I have tried to verify it, but that, in short, was very
THE MONTH OP RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) 157
large. There is no Sharif or person of means in Mecca who does
not offer victims, and for days the people of Mecca stay eating
and giving to eat, deriving and granting pleasure, and thanking
Great and Glorious God for the help and assistance He gave
to them in the building of His Sacred House in the style it had
in the time of (God's) Friend, Abraham - may God bless and
preserve him. But Hajjaj - God's maledictions upon him -
demolished it, and restored it to the form it had held in the
time of the Quraysh who in their reconstruction had reduced
the dimensions of Abraham - may God bless and preserve him.
Our Prophet, Muhammad - may God bless and preserve him
- left it as it was, because of the recency of their conversion
from unbelief, as it is established in the tradition of' A'ishah -
may God hold her in His favour - in the Muwatta of Malik
ibn Anas - may God hold him in His favour.
On the 29th of the month, which was a Thursday, the House
was reserved for women exclusively, and they congregated
from all parts. They had assembled for it some days before,
as they had done for (the visit to) the venerated sanctuaries,
and there was no woman in Mecca but that day went to the
Sacred Mosque. When the Shayba [the hereditary guardians]
arrived to open the venerated House, they made haste that they
might depart to leave it free to the women, and likewise the
men left clear to them the place of circumambulation and the
Hijr, so that not a man remained around the blessed House.
The women rushed to ascend the steps, and the Shayba could
hardly get through them as they made their descent from the
venerated House. They formed a chain, the one holding the
other, and fell into such a state of confusion that they collapsed.
Some shrieked, some wailed, and some cried, 'God is
Great,' and others, 'There is no God but God.' One saw in
them the same crowding that was seen at the time of the stay
of the Yemenite Saru in Mecca when they ascended to the
Holy House the day that it was opened, one case resembling
the other. Thus they continued for the first part of the day,
at their ease performing the tawaf, pausing in the Hijr, and
158 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
dividing themselves between kissing the Black Stone and
touching the corners (of the Ka'bah). It was their grandest,
most splendid, and most solemn day. May God give them
advantage from it, and make it pleasing before His noble
countenance.
Yet on the whole, in comparison with the men, they are
wretched and cheated. They see the venerated House and may
not enter it, they gaze upon the blessed Stone but cannot touch
it, and their lot is wholly one of staring and feeling the sadness
that moves and holds them. They have nothing but the tawaf
at a distance. This day (therefore) which is an annual event,
they expect as one expects the most solemn of festivals, and for
it they make many provisions and preparations. May God, by
His grace and favour, advantage them for their sincere intentions
and their faith.
Early next day, the Shayba began to wash the Ka'bah with
the blessed water of Zamzam, for many of the women had
brought their little children and sucking babes with them. They
found it proper to wash it both out of respect and in order to rid
it of impurities, as well as to remove what might put thoughtsin
the mind of him who has no self-control that would prevent
him from committing an unclean act in that noble Abode
and Station of exclusive holiness arid sublimity. When the water
poured from the Ka'bah many men and women hastened to
it, seeking blessedness by laving their hands and faces in it, and
often collecting it in vases they had brought for the purpose.
This they did all careless of the use to which the water had
been put in the cleansing, although some of them did abstain,
and perhaps they surveyed the spectacle as one who did not
deem it lawful, or whose mind could not find it good. What
do you think of the blessed water of Zamzam being poured
into God's Holy House, going in waves to its blessed corners
and then flowing beside al-Multazam and the (much-) kissed
Black Stone? Is it not fitting that it should be met with the
mouths rather than the hands, and .that the face should be
plunged into it rather than the feet? God forbid then that there
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (579) 159
should arise a cause to prevent anyone from that, or a doubt
that might deter him. (Good) intentions are accepted by God
Most High, and zeal in the magnifying of His holy places leads
to His approval. He is the Rewarder of latent thoughts and
hidden secrets. There is no God but He.
The Month of Sha'ban the Honoured (579)
[19th of November-i7th of December, 1183]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Saturday
the 19th of November. Early next morning the Emir
Mukthir came to perform the tawaf that is customary at the
beginning of each month. With him were his brother, and his
sons, and those of his officers, followers, and adherents who
were accustomed to accompany him. It was in the manner
before described, the Zamzam muezzin, according to his practice,
calling in turns with his younger brother from his look-out.
At dawn on Thursday the 13 th of the month, being the 1st
of December, and after day had broken, the moon was eclipsed.
The eclipse began while men were saying the morning prayers
in the noble Haram, and the moon set while in eclipse. The
maximum eclipse reached was two-thirds. God teaches us to
draw true knowledge from His prodigies.
On Friday the following day, a strange circumstance occurred
in the Haram. It was that there was not a boy in Mecca but
did not come early to it; and congregating all in the dome
of Zamzam they cried with one voice, 'Recite the tahlil ["There
is no God but God"] and the takbir ["God is Great"], O servants
of God,' and the people cried out the tahlil and the takbir. Sometimes
one of the crowd joined with these boys and called with
them. Men and women were crowding round the dome of
the blessed well because they thought, rather on the affirmation
of the ignorant than of the wise, that the water of Zamzam
rose on the night of the middle of the month of Sha'ban. They
were in doubt as to (the date of) the new moon of that month,
for it was said that it had been seen on the night of Friday
in the direction of the Yemen. And so they came early to the
dome, forming a crowd the like of which has not been seen.
THE MONTH OF SHA'BAN THE HONOURED (579) 161
Their aim in this was to gain the grace of that blessed water
whose rise was evident. The water distributors stood on the
orifice of the well, drawing water and pouring it on the heads
of people by throwing it from a bucket. Some received it on
the face, others on the head or elsewhere, and often the water
would go far from the force of the thrust from their hands.
The men nevertheless called for more, and wept, while the
women on their side rivalled them in weeping, and competed
with them in prayers, the boys meanwhile raising a clamour
with their tahlils and takbirs. It was an overwhelming spectacle
and thrilling to hear. Because of it those performing the tawaf
could not complete it, nor, because of the high cries that occupied
the ears and understanding, could those at prayer discharge
their orisons.
One of our number that day entered into the dome, and
from the press of the crowd suffered distress and difficulty. He
heard men crying, 'The water has risen seven cubits,' and directing
himself towards one of the white-moustachioed ones who
bore some impress of intelligence and perspicacity in his features,
questioned him concerning it. 'Yes,' he replied, the tears streaming
down his face. 'The water has risen seven cubits, there is
no doubt of it.' 'Is your information sure?' our comrade asked,
and the man gave answer, 'Yes.' It is very strange that among
them was one who said that he had come at dawn on Friday,
and found the water to be about the stature of a man from the
brim. Oh strange and false invention! We take refuge in God
from such seducements. It was by chance that we concerned
ourselves with this affair, through the predominance of the
reports spread about it, and their continuance over many years
among the common people of Mecca.
On Friday night one of us lowered his bucket into the blessed
well until it touched the surface of the water, and made a knot
in the rope at the place where it reached the brim. We were
thus able to measure it truly. In the morning the people cried
out that the water had plainly risen, but one of us, making
his way with difficulty through the crowd, and accompanied
162 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
by one who carried the bucket, lowered the vessel into the
well and found that the measurement was the same, neither
more nor less. On the other hand, it is remarkable that when
lie returned to measure it on Saturday night, he found it had
somewhat decreased because of the large amount that people
had drawn from it that day. But if they had been drawing
from the ocean, the loss would still have been apparent. Glory
to God who especially endowed this water with the blessedness
it has, and infused it with benefit. On the morning of
Saturday the 15th of the month, we carefully examined this
measurement in order to clear all doubt as to the truth of the
matter, and found it to be as it was before. But if anyone had
remarked that day that the water had not risen, he would have
been thrown into the well, or been trodden under foot until
he dissolved. We take refuge in God from the violence and
excesses of the crowd, and their indulgement of ungoverned
passions.
This blessed night, that is, the night of the middle of Sha'ban,
is held in high esteem by the Meccans, because of the noble
tradition that has come down to us concerning it. They contend
with each other in performing pious acts such as the 'umrah,
the tawaf, and prayers, both singly and in congregation, dividing
into blessed divisions. On the Saturday night, which was the
middle night of the month, and after the evening prayers, we
observed a vast concourse in the Haram. Men began in groups
to say the tarwih prayers, to recite the opening Surah of the
Koran and to swear 'God, He is One' ten times for each rak'ah,
until they had done fifty taslim with one hundred rak'ah. Each
group had elected an imam, mats were spread, candles lit,
torches kindled, and lamps lighted. The lamp of the bright,
moonlit sky shed its radiance on the earth and spread its rays,
its beams meeting in this noble Haram which is itself a light.
Oh what a spectacle, that the imagination could not conceive
or the fancy conjecture!
That night the people divided into groups. One took part
in these tarawih in congregation, of which there were seven or
THE MONTH OF SHA'BAN THE HONOURED (579) 163
eight, another stayed, in the Hijr to pray there individually,
another left on the 'umrah, and another chose to perform the
tawaf, most of these being Malikites. It was one of the famous
nights, which it is hoped will be the choicest and the best of
the propitiatory acts. May God, by His favour, grant profit
from it, dispensing not with the grace and excellence of it,
and bringing to this holy place of meeting all who yearn
for it.
That blessed night one of us, Ahmad ibn Hassan, witnessed
a remarkable circumstance; one of those strange events that are
memorable among things of sensibility. It happened that he
was struck by the urge to sleep in the remaining third of the
night, and retired to the bench that surrounds the Dome of
Zamzam, on the part that faces the Black Stone and the door
of the House, and there laid himself down to sleep. Suddenly
a foreign man came and sat on the bench beside his head and
began to recite the Koran in a moving and gentle voice, accompanying
it with deep sighs and sobs. He recited beautifully,
mstilling the sentiments into the soul, and infusing them with
a power to move (even) the insensible. Our comrade abstained
from sleeping that he might enjoy the beauty of what he heard,
with all its yearning and emotion. At last the man ended his
reciting and said:
'If evil deeds have taken me far from You
My honest thoughts have brought me near again,'
repeating the words in tones of harmony that would cleave
stones and break the heart. On he went retelling these lines,
while his tears flowed and his voice trembled and grew weak,
until it came to Ahmad ibn Hassan that the man would faint.
This thought had no sooner passed through his mind than on
the instant the man fell swooning to the ground, and lay there
like something cast aside, moving not. Ibn Hassan rose up much
alarmed at the frightening thing he had seen, uncertain as to
whether the man were dead or alive, so violent had been the
fall, the place being raised high from the ground. Another who
164 THE TRAVELS Or IBN JUBAYR
had been sleeping near him then got up, and both stood bewildered,
being fearful of shaking the man or even of approaching
him. At last a foreign woman passed and crying, 'Is it thus
you leave this man, and in this state?' made speed to take a
little water from the Well of Zamzam and sprinkle it on his
face. The other two then approached the man and raised him.
But when he saw them, he straightway concealed his face from
them, for fear that his features should be impressed upon their
minds, and rose without delay and betook himself towards Bab
Banu Shayba. The two remained marvelling at what they had
seen, and Ibn Hassan bit his fingers in regret at the opportunity
he had missed of gaining the blessings of the man's prayers.
For the situation had not allowed him to ask of them, and he
had retained no image of him that he might seek his blessings
when he should encounter him again. The assemblies of these
foreigners, in sensibility, in emotionalism, in the ready ecstasies,
in zealous ardour of worship, in assiduity in acts of piety and
in the manifestation of grace, are truly remarkable and exalted.
Grace is in God's hands, and He bestows it on whom He wishes.
At dawn on Thursday the 13 th of the month, the moon
was eclipsed to an extent of two-thirds, and it set in this state
of eclipse at the rising of the sun. God inspires us to ponder
His portents.
The Month of Ramadan the Sublime (579)
[18th of December, Ii83-i6th of January, 1184]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon rose on the night of Monday the 19th of
December - may God let us know His grace and justice,
and grant unto us the acceptance of our prayers throughout
this month. The month's fast began on Sunday for the people
of Mecca, on a claim that the new moon had been observed,
a claim unverified but nevertheless supported by the Emir.
The signal for the fast was given by drumbeat on the Sunday
night, following the rites observed by him and his sect the
'Aliites and those of their persuasion. For, as it is said, they
deem the fast to fall due on a day that is doubtful [being either
the last day of Sha'ban or the first of Ramadan]. God best
knows concerning this.
During this blessed month there was much ceremony in the
sacred Mosque, making necessary the renewal of the mats, and
the increasing of the candles and firebrands and other appointments
until the Haram blazed with light and shone with brightness.
The imams formed separate groups in order to recite the
tarwih. The Shafi'ites, who had precedence over the others, had
set up an imam on one side of the Mosque, and the Hanbalites,
the Hanafites, and the Zaydis had done the same. As for the
Malikites, they had gathered round three reciters who recited
in turn. In this year, the attendance of this sect was greater
than usual and it possessed more candles, because a party of
Malikite merchants had vied with each other, bringing to
the imam of the Ka'bah a vast quantity. Two of the largest,
weighing each a qintar, were placed in front of the mihrab, and
round them were the lesser candles, some big some small. Thus
the Malikite part of the Mosque excited wonder for its beauty
and overpowered the eyes with its radiance. There was hardly
K
166 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
a recess or direction in the Mosque where there was not a reciter
with a group praying behind him. The Mosque shook with
the voices of reciters in every part, so that the eyes beheld a
sight, and the ears heard strains that ravished the senses with
emotion and fervour.
Some of the foreigners confined themselves to performing
the tawaf and to praying in the Hijr, and did not take part in
the tarwih, deeming that that was the best advantage they could
take of their opportunity, and the noblest function they could
undertake, for not in every place can be found the Venerated
Corner and the Multazam. The Shafi'ite imam was the most
assiduous in the tarwih, in that having completed the customary
tanvih, which is ten taslim, he joined in a tawaf with one of
the groups. And when he had done the sevenfold tawaf and
the rak'ah, he commenced again to recite more tarawih, and
cracked the preacher's whip, of which we have already spoken,
a crack that could be heard throughout the Mosque so loud
it was, and that seemed to be a signal to return to prayers.
When his group had ended two taslim they returned to perform
again seven tawaf. When they had finished them, the whip was
cracked again and they turned once more to the taslim, and
then again back to the tawaf and so on until they had done ten
taslim and completed twenty rak'ah. They then recited the shaf'
wa watar prayers68 and departed.
The other imams add nothing to the customary (ritual). The
imams that in turn officiate at these tarawih beside the Maqam
are five. The first of them is the obligatory imam,69 and the
middle one is our friend the jurisprudent, the ascetic and Godfearing
Abuja'far ibn ('Ah) al-Fanaki of Cordova, whose recitations
soften the hard stones in emotion. The whip which we
mentioned is used in this blessed month. It is cracked three
times at the conclusion of the sunset call to prayers, and similarly
at the end of the call to evening prayers. Beyond a doubt
it is one of the recent innovations in this august Mosque - may
God sanctify it.
The Zamzam muezzin is encharged with the duty of
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) 167
announcing the daybreak meal [safowr]. He does it from the minaret
in the east corner of the Mosque because of its nearness to
the Emir's house. There he stands, at that time, calling, reminding,
and urging to the meal. With him are two younger brothers
who answer him and call in their turn. At the top of the minaret
has been fixed a long board at whose end, crosswise like outstretched
arms, is a pole supporting at its tips two small pulleys
on which hang two large glass lanterns that remain alight
throughout the time of the meal. When the 'first gleams of
dawn draw near' [Koran II, 187], and the signal to end the
meal has time and again been sounded, the muezzin lowers
the two lanterns from the top of the board, and commences
the call to prayer, when from all sides the muezzins take up
the call. All the houses of Mecca have high roofs, and whosoever
does not hear the call to the daybreak meal because of
the distance of his house from the Mosque may see the two
lanterns alight on the top of the minaret. When he does not
see them, he knows that the period for eating has ended (and
the fast resumed).
The night of Tuesday the 2nd of Ramadan, in the evening,
the Emir Mukthir performed a tawaf of farewell and then
left (Mecca) to meet the Emir Sayf al-Islam (Tughtagin or
Tuldequinas) ibn Ayyub, brother of Saladin. News of his
coming from Egypt had come ahead of him some time before;
then came consecutive messages until at last it was confirmed
that he had arrived at Yanbu' [Yenbo], and had turned aside
to Medina to visit the tomb of the Apostle - may God bless
and preserve him. His heavy baggage had been sent before him
to Al-Safra'. As to the reason for his journey, men said that
he was on his way to the Yemen because of some disputes
hat had risen there, and because of a rebellion raised by its
emirs. But into the minds of the Meccans entered a dreadful
apprehension, and fear fell upon them. So this Emir Mukthir
left to meet and greet him, and in truth to make submission
to him. May God Most High acquaint the Muslims with His
goodness.
168 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
In the forenoon of Wednesday the 3rd of the blessed month,
we were sitting in the honoured Hijr when we heard the drums
of the Emir Mukthir and the voices of the women of Mecca
ululating for him. While we were listening, the Emir entered,
for he had returned from meeting the Emir Sayf al-Islam. He
made the tawaf of the taslim around the venerated House, while
the people manifested their joy at his return and their happiness
at his safety. Report had gone abroad that Sayf al-Islam
had come to al-Zahir, and that his tents had been pitched there.
An advanced party of his army had arrived at the Haram, and
encompassed the Emir Mukthir as he performed the tawaf.
While the people were gazing on them, they suddenly heard
a great clamour and fearful shouting and there they saw the
Emir Sayf al-Islam entering by the Bab Banu Shayba. The
flashings of the swords before him almost obstructed the view
of him. The Qadi was on his right, and the chief of the Shayba
on his left. The Mosque was in great commotion, being filled
with spectators and pilgrims; and the voices of men in prayer
for him and for his brother Saladin rose so high as to deafen
the ears and confound the understanding. From his high post
the Zamzam muezzin raised his voice in prayer and praise for
him; the voices of the people rose above the muezzin's; and
great was the awe of the scene to look upon and hear.
As the Emir drew near to the sublime House, swords were
sheathed, spirits contracted, the fine clothing was cast off, necks
were depressed and their napes enhumbled, and minds were
bereft of steadiness, in awe and reverence of the House of the
King of Kings, the Powerful, the Mighty, the One, the Conquering,
who grants possessions to whom He wishes, and takes
them away from whom He wills. Praise be to Him. Great is
His strength, glorious His power.
This troop of Ghuzz [Seljuk Turks] hurled itself into God's
Ancient House with the impetuosity of moths at a lamp.
Humility had bowed their heads [lit. 'chins'], and tears bathed
their moustaches. The Qadi and the chief of the Shayba performed
the tawaf with Sayf al-Islam, but the Emir Mukthir
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) 169
was overcome by the crowd, and. made speed to end it, hastening
to his residence. When Sayf al-Islam had ended his tawaf,
he prayed behind the Maqam, and then entered the Zamzam
Dome and drank of its waters. After this he left by the Bab
al-Safa to perform the sai. He commenced to march on foot,
that he might show humbleness and submission to whom
humbleness is due. Swords were drawn before him, and from
one end of the mas a to the other the people had drawn themselves
up in two ranks as they had done for the tawaf. He performed
the sai on foot both ways, from al-Safa to al-Marwah
and from al-Marwah to al-Safa. He ran between the two green
mil, and then, seized by fatigue, he mounted his horse and
finished the sa'i in. the saddle.
The people had now assembled for the midday prayers, and
the Emir returned to the Sacred Mosque in the same frightening
and impressive manner, proudly walking between the dazzling
glitter of the drawn swords. The Shayba had hastened
there before him to open the door of the venerated House, for
it was not a (normal) day of opening. The stairway by which
one ascends to it was brought close, and the Emir mounted it.
The chief of the Shayba made to open the door, when on
account of the throng, the key fell from his sleeve and he stood
there bewildered and afraid. The Emir stood waiting on the
steps, but God gave help at once in finding the key and the
noble door was opened. The Emir entered alone with the
Shayba and the door was locked, while the leading men and
notables of the Ghuzz remained crowding round the steps.
After some delay, the door was opened to the emirs of the
suite and they entered. Sayf al-Islam tarried a long time in the
venerated House, and when he came forth, the door was opened
to the vulgar. O what crowding and piling up! They were
so arranged as to form a sort of long string of beads, being
joined together in a chain. I compare it to something of the
days when the Saru entered the House as already described.
The Emir Sayf al-Islam then took to his horse and left to his
pitched tents in the aforementioned place. This day in Mecca
VJO THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
had been one of those that present a portentous spectacle and
a wonderful sight, being a most remarkable affair. Glory to
Him whose dominion has no end, and whose authority does
not grow less. There is no God but He.
A group of pilgrims from Egypt and other lands had travelled
with the Emir that they might take advantage of the security
given on the road across open country, and they arrived safely
and in good health. Praise be to God.
In the forenoon of the following Thursday we were again
in the venerated Hijr when once more the sound of timbals,
drums, and trumpets smote the ears, and all parts of the noble
Haram shook from it. While we gazed that we might understand
its meaning, the Emir Mukthir appeared before us, surrounded
by his close followers, and trailing a golden mantle
that was like glowing coal. On his head was a turban of fine
linen, cloud-coloured but touched with gold, whose windings
rose up on his head like heaped clouds. Beneath the mantle
were two coats of honour, made from Dabiqi material and
beautifully embroidered, bestowed on him by the Emir Sayf
al-Islam. Dressed in these, he arrived gaily and cheerfully, and
by decree of Sayf al-Islam, timbals and drums announced his
coming as a mark of this prince's respect for him and to affirm
his standing. Round the noble House he walked, thanking God
for granting him the consideration of this Emir when once he
had been throbbing with fear of him. May God by His favour
fortify and prosper him.
On Friday the Emir Sayf al-Islam arrived for the prayers at
the beginning of the appointed time. The venerated House was
opened for him, and he entered it with the Emir Mukthir.
For some time they stayed within, and when they came forth,
the Ghuzz so crowded round to enter that the spectators were
amazed and the point came when the stairway had to be
removed. But this availed nothing, and they continued to
swarm, raising themselves over each other and persisting in this
until the khatib arrived. They then emerged to listen to the
khutbah and the door was closed. The Emir Sayf al-Islam
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) 171
prayed with the Emir Mukthir in the 'Abbaside Dome, and
when the prayers had ended he left by the Bab al-Safa and rode
to his encampment. On Wednesday the 14th of the month this
Emir left with his soldiers for the Yemen. May God by His
favour grant that the Muslims in that land shall n his coming
be acquainted only with good.
We have descanted upon the zeal of the settlers [mujawirin]
in the noble Haram in discharging religious duties and reciting
the tarawih of the blessed month (of Ramadan), and on the
number of imams (officiating) in the Haram. On every odd
night of the last ten nights of the month the whole of the
Koran is recited. At the first night, which was the 21st of the
month, a Meccan youth recited in the presence of the Qadi
and a number of sheiks. When this was over, he rose among
them and preached a khutbah. The father of the youth then
invited them to his house for food and sweetmeats, which he
had prepared with much care. The next night, the 23 rd, the
reciter was one of the sons of a rich Meccan, a boy who had
not reached the age of fifteen. His father had made uncommon
preparations for this night, having arranged a chandelier, made
of wax, with branches, set with all manner of fruits, fresh and
dry, and furnished with many candles. In the middle of the
Haram, towards the Bab Banu Shayba, was a sort of quadrilateral
tnihrab with a wooden balustrade, standing on four
pedestals and having at its summit wooden shafts, from which
hung lamps, and on which stood lighted lanterns and torches.
Round the tnihrah were driven sharp-headed nails on to which
were fixed the candles that surrounded all the tnihrab. The
branched chandelier bearing the fruits was then lit. In all this
the father of the lad had shown assiduous care.
Near to the tnihrab was placed a pulpit adorned with a cloth
chequered in many colours. The youthful imam arrived and said
the tarawih and completed his recitation of the whole Koran,
all who were in the sacred Mosque, men and women, assembling
around him. In his tnihrab, he could hardly be seen for the many
rays of the candles that encompassed him. He then came forth
172 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
from his mihrab, strutting proudly in his rich apparel, with the
port of an imam and the calmness of youth, his eyes shaded with
kuhl [collyrium] and his hands hennaed to the wrists. But from
the press of men he could not make his way to the pulpit, so
one of the guardians of that part took him in his arms and
brought him to the top of the pulpit, where he settled smiling,
and signed in greeting to those present. Before him sat the
Koran readers, who began to recite in chorus. When they had
finished a tenth part of the Koran, the (young) preacher rose
and pronounced an eloquent sermon that moved most spirits,
more from its mellifluous delivery than from its piously recollective
or emotional qualities. In front of him, on the steps
of the pulpit, was a small group of men holding candlesticks
in their hands and crying aloud, 'O Lord! O Lord!' at each
pause in the sermon. The readers began their reciting during
these pauses, and the preacher held silence until they had done.
He then returned to his sermon, freely recalling various pious
memories, and referring during this to the Ancient Housemay
God honour it - baring his arms in pointing at it. He followed
on by mentioning the Well of Zamzam and the Maqam,
pointing at them with both fingers. He ended with the valediction
of the blessed month, saluted repeatedly, and made invocations
for the Caliph and for all the Emirs for whom it was
customary to pray. He then descended, and that large assembly
dissolved. They had found the preacher intelligent and talented,
although his discourse had not touched the soul as had been
hoped and the pious recollections that left his tongue had not
gone beyond the ears. It was reported that selected persons
among this assembly, such as the Qadi and others, were provided
with abundant food and sweetmeat, after the fashion of
such meetings. The father of the preacher that night incurred
large expense on the preparations which we have described.
Then came the night of the 25th, and the reciter appointed
for that evening's portion of the reading of the whole Koran
was a Hanafite imam. He had brought a son of his to do it,
a boy of about the age of the first preacher we mentioned.
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) .1.73
The Hanafite imam had made great preparations on behalf of
his son for this night. He produced four candle-bearing chandeliers
of varying styles, some being like trees with branches laden
with all kinds of fruits, fresh and dry, and some being without
branches. They were arranged in line before his hatim, on whose
summit were boards and planks covered with lamps, torches,
and candles, that illuminated all the hatim until it shone in the
air like a great crown of light. The candles were brought forward
in brass candlesticks, and then was set in place the mihrab
with the wooden balustrades, its upper part ringed with candles
and itself encompassed by candlesticks that threw a halo of light
around it. In front of it was placed the pulpit, which also was
covered with a cloth of various colours. The massing of the
people to see this lustrous spectacle was greater than at the
first. The boy did his portion of the reading of the whole
Koran and then moved from his mihrab to the pulpit, bearing
himself shyly and dressed in vestments beautiful to behold. He
climbed his pulpit and signed in greeting to those present, and
then began his sermon, calmly and with gentleness, in language
of transparent modesty. Considering his youth, it was graver
and more moving than the first, his exhortations were more
eloquent, and his pious recollections more profitable. The Koran
readers took post in front of him after the fashion of the first
occasion, and, during the pauses between the readings, began
to recite the Koran. He would keep silence until they had ended
the verses they had selected and then return to his sermon.
Before him on the steps of the pulpit was a group of (mosque)
attendants holding candlesticks in their hands, and one of them
the censer which repeatedly spread the aroma of the aloe \Aquilaria
agalhcha]. When the preacher came to a break in a pious
recollection or a moving entreaty, these men raised their voices
crying, 'O Lord! O Lord!' three or four times, sometimes
being joined in their cries by the congregation; and so it continued
until he had ended his sermon. He then came down and
the imam (his father) followed after him to serve the food to
those personages of the place who were present, either by
174 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
inviting them to his house that night, or by sending it to their
homes.
Then came the night of the 27th, which was a Friday, the
month having been deemed to have begun on a Sunday. It
was a noble night, with its auspicious portion of the reading
of the whole Koran, its full and mature dignity, and the state
that make prayers acceptable to Great and Glorious God. And
what state can compare to attending the reading of the Koran
on the night of the 27th of Ramadan behind the venerated
Maqam and in front of the sublime House? It is a night which
in grace makes all others seem but mean, as does the Haram
make insignificant all other places. Thought and preparation
are given to this blessed night two or three days before. Beside
the hatim of the Shafi'ite imam were planted huge wooden
poles of considerable height, joined every three by stout beams
and forming a continuous row that occupies almost half of the
width of the Haram and reaches to the hatim. Long planks
passed between them, extending over the beams and raised to
form one storey over another until three storeys were completed.
The upper storey was a long wooden platform perforated
throughout with sharp-headed nails, close-set like the
back of a hedgehog, on which candles were fixed. The two
lower stages were of planks pierced with close-set apertures in
which were placed the glasses of lamps with pipes that rose
from below them and hung from the sides of these planks and
poles. From all the beams hung lanterns, large and small, interspersed
by a form of large brass disc, to each of which were
fixed three chains which held them in the air. All these discs
were pierced with apertures in which were glasses with pipes
coming from below these brass discs, no pipe being bigger than
another. In them the lanterns were lighted so that they seemed
like a many-legged table sinning forth light.
Connected with the second hatim, which faces the south
corner of the Dome of Zamzam, was a wooden construction
of the same style which reached to that corner. The firebrands
which were on top of the ball (surmounting) the dome were
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) 175
lit, and along the edge of its lattice, on the side facing the
venerated House, was set a row of candles. The noble Maqam
was encompassed by a construction composed of a carved
wooden balustrade, its upper part surrounded by sharp-headed
nails which, as before described, were all provided with candles.
To the right and the left of the Maqam were ranged thick
candles in candlesticks proportionate to them in size. These
candlesticks were disposed on the stools which the guardians
use for their ascent to kindle the lights. All the walls of the
venerated Hijr were covered with candles in brass candlesticks
forming a circle of radiant light. The Haram itself was surrounded
by torches, and all the illuminations described were
set alight. The merlons around the Haram were filled with
Meccan boys, each of whom held a cloth soaked in olive oil
which they placed burning on the tops of the merlons. Each
group of them took one of the four sides, and competed with
the one beside it as to who should first light up its side. Thet
beholder conceived that the flame leapt from merlon to merlon,
for the persons of the boys were hidden behind the light that
dazzled the eyes. As they did this they cried aloud and in chorus,
'O Lord! O Lord!' and the Haram shook with their voices.
When all that we have described was set alight the brilliant
rays bade fair to blind the eyes, and not a glance could fall on
any edge or fringe where there was not a light to engage the
sense of sight from turning elsewhere. Let the imagination play
on the grandeur of what can be seen upon that blessed night,
which in its nobleness strips off the clothes of darkness and
adorns itself in the illuminations of the sky.
The Qadi advanced and said the last obligatory prayer of
the evening, rising then to begin the Surat al-Qadr,70 which
the imams of the Haram had reached in their recitation of the
previous night. Thereupon all the other imams stayed their tellings
of the tarawih in deference to the reciting of the Koran at
the Maqam, and presented themselves to acquire blessedness
by attending it. The immaculate maqam was brought forth
from its new repository in the Ancient House, as we described
176 THE TRAVELS Ur liJJN JUUAYK
in the first mention of it in this journal, and placed in its noble
place; the place used as an oratory and covered by a dome
behind which men pray. The Qadi ended with two taslim [benedictions],
and then rose, facing the Maqam and the Ancient
House, to preach the sermon. But it could not be heard because
of the crowd and its clamour. When he had finished, the imams
resumed their tarawih and the congregation dispersed. Their
spirits had taken wing from emotion and their eyes streamed
with tears; and from the grace of that blessed night their souls
took hope that from the omens God Most High would by
His favour accept their prayers. They perceived that it was
indeed the noble night of Qadr described in the revelation.
May Great and Glorious God deprive none of the blessing of
sharing in it and the grace of witnessing it. For He is Kind
and Gracious. There is no God but He.
Following this night, the five imams of the Maqam of whom
we have earlier spoken were assigned to the reciting of verses
that they selected from various chapters of the Koran and which
contained pious recollections, warnings, and good news, according
to the choice of each. The order of their tawaf, which followed
two taslim, remained unvarying. God is He who accepts
the prayers of all.
Then came the night of the 29th. The reader of the final
part of the whole Koran is one of the remaining imams who
conduct the tarawih, and who undertake the ceremony of the
khutbah that follows the reading of the Koran. The one
appointed in this case was the Malikite. He came forward with
a number of boards and beside his mihrah he planted six in the
form of a mihrab's circle [semicircle] and rising little less than
a man's stature from the ground. Over every two of these
crossed a wide board; the top was ringed with candles, and the
lower part with the remainder of the many candles we mentioned
in our first description of the blessed month. The inside
of that circle was also fringed with other candles of medium
size. It was a simple sp'ectacle, a scene without display, wholesome
and quiet, and expectant of full recompense and reward
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE SUBLIME (579) 177
proportionate to the goodly aspect of the mihrab. The candles,
instead of being placed in candlesticks, were supported by stones.
The result was remarkable for its simplicity, being removed
from pride and display and within the bounds of humbleness
and modesty.
All the Malikites flocked to the final part of the reading of
the whole Koran, which was done in turn by the imams of
the tarawih, who ended their prayers sharply and with speed,
so that the beginning and the end almost met, so great was
the haste and despatch with which they were said. One of them
then rose and tied his garments between the supports as a prop
and delivered his khutbah, which was composed of extracts
from the khutbah of the youthful son of the Hanafite imam;
and these he rendered a second time to his listeners in accents
grave according to his temper. The congregation then dispersed,
with tears congealing in their ducts. In a moment the
candles were torn from their supports, and preying hands were
let loose, there being none among that concourse who felt
shame or respect. For this God Most High will give requital
and reward, for He, Glory to Him, is the Generous One and
the Giver.
So ended the nights of the mondi (of Ramadan), which for
us passed tranquilly. May God grant that we shall be among
those who have been cleansed of their sins during it, and be
not bereft of the favour of the acceptance of our prayers,
because of the blessedness of fasting beside the Ka'bah, the
Sacred House. May He seal our days, and those of all within
the community of sincere Muslims, by death within Islam.
Instil in us the praise and thanks such benefits deserve; make
them for us a treasure in the life to come, and render unto us,
because of them, recompense and reward. Let us hope that by
His grace and favour, He will not overlook the days on which
we broke our fast with the waters of Zamzam. He is the
Merciful, the Liberal. There is no Lord but He.
The Month of Shawwal (579)
[17th of January-i4th of February, 1184]
May God let us know His favour
T'HE new moon rose on the night of Tuesday the 16th of
January. May God prosper its rising and bestow on us its
blessings. This blessed month is the first of 'the well-known
months of the pilgrimage' [Koran II, 197], and after it follow
three sacred and blessed months. The night of the rising of
this new moon was one of great assembly in the sacred Mosque
- may God increase it in honour. The pattern of lighting the
torches, chandeliers, and candles was the same as for the night
of the twenty-seventh of the Sublime month of Ramadan. The
minarets at the four sides of the Haram were iUuminated, as
was the roof of the mosque on the summit ofJabal Abu Qubays.
The muezzin stayed all that night on the roof of the Dome of
Zamzam, calling out the tahlil ['There is no God but God'],
the takbir ['God is Great'], the tasbih ['I extol the holiness of
God'], and offering up praise. Most of the imams and the
people remained awake that night performing the tawaf, saying
prayers, and calling the tahlil and the takbir. May God
accept the prayers of all. In truth He it is who hearkens to
prayers and guarantees hope. Glory to Him. There is no God
but He.
When morning came, and the dawn-prayers had ended, the
people donned their festival dress and hastened to take their
stations for the prayers of the Feast in the sacred Mosque. For
it was the rule to pray in the Mosque rather than in an oratory,
from a desire to profit from the nobleness of the place and the
grace of its blessedness, as well as the merit of the prayers of
the imam and those who perform them with him behind the
Maqam. First in their early arrival were the Shayba who opened
the door of the holy Ka'bah. Their chief sat on the holy threshold,
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (579) U9
and the others entered the Ka'bah until they perceived that
the Emir Mukthir had arrived. They then went down to him
and met him near to the Gate of the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him. He came to the venerated House and made
the sevenfold circumambulation. The people had come in great
numbers for their feast, and the Haram was teeming with them;
and on the dome of the Well of Zamzam the muezzin stood,
according to his practice, raising his voice in praise and invocation.
In this he took turns with his brother.
When the Emir had done the seven circuits, he went to the
bench at the Zamzam Dome on the side facing the Black
Corner, and there sat, with his sons to the right and left of
him, and his viziers and suite about him. The Shayba returned
to their posts in the venerated House, while the people gazed
upon them with their eyes filled with emotion towards the
House, and with unembittered envy of them in their connection
with it and their offices as chamberlains and guardians.
Glory to God who gave them the special honour of serving it.
Four poets of the Emir's suite presented themselves and recited
poetry the one after the other until they had done. During this,
the sun had well risen and the time of the midday prayer was
at hand. The Qadi, who was to deliver the sermon, advanced
majestically between his two black banners, himself in black
robes, and preceded by the whip which we have already mentioned,
and the crack of which reverberated throughout the
Haram. He came to the venerated Maqam, and the congregation
rose to prayer. When it was ended, he ascended the pulpit
which had been placed in the spot allotted to it every Friday,
beside the wall of the venerated Ka'bah where the noble door
opens, and delivered an eloquent sermon. The muezzins were
seated below him on the steps of the pulpit, and when he
opened each part of the sermon with takbir they repeated it
with him, and so it continued until he had ended his sermon.
The people then went up to each other to shake hands and
offer greetings, begging God's pardon each on behalf of the
other, and wishing each other good; glad, joyful, and happy
180 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
at the favour that God had bestowed on them. They then
hastened to the venerated House and entered with the 'salute'
in peace, coming on in crowds, wave upon wave, and forming
a sublime spectacle and a concourse that by the grace of
God Most High shall gain His compassion. May God make it
a treasure for them in the life to come, as, by His grace and
favour, He made this noble festival the most excellent of our
time. Over all this He holds sway, and these things He
determines.
When the people had dispersed from their prayers and the
ritual of greeting each other, they betook themselves to the
visit of the cemetery in Mala. They did this to gain blessings,
(heavenly) count being taken of the steps they take to it and
of the prayers for mercy made on behalf of those of His saintly
servants and others who have lain there since the first days of
Islam. May God hold them all in His favour and reckon us of
their number and advantage us of their love. 'For man', as said
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - 'is with him
whom God loves.'71
On Saturday the 19th of this month, being the 3rd of February,
we ascended Mina to observe the solemn rites that are
discharged there, and to inspect the lodging hired for us in
readiness for our stay there if it so pleases God, on the days of
the Tashriq.7* We found that it filled the soul with joy and
solace. It is a city of great ruins, of wide extent, and of ancient
foundation, but all of it has been destroyed save for a few buildings
taken as lodging places that enfold on both sides a road
that in length and width is like a course for running horses.
The first thing that a person on his way there finds, to his left
and near to it, is the Mosque of the Blessed Covenant, referring
to the first covenant in Islam; that which was concluded by
'Abbas - may God hold him in His favour - on behalf of the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve him-with the Ansar
[Auxiliaries of Madinah], as is well-known. From there he goes
to the Cairn [jamrah] of al-'Aqabah, which is the beginning
of Mina when coming from Mecca and to the left. It is on the
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (579) 181
side of the road, and is an elevated spot because of the piled-up
stones that have been cast, and but for the miracles of God
manifest in it, it would have seemed to have been a large
mountain, so great has been the collection (of stones) over the
successive ages and through long centuries. But in it Great and
Glorious God has one of His hidden and venerated secrets.
There is no God but He.
On the cairn is a blessed mosque, and a sign has been raised
on it similar to those in the Haram that we have described.
One who is casting stones, facing Mecca-may God honour
it - has this cairn to his right. At this place he will throw seven
stones on the Day of Sacrifice after sunrise. He will then slaughter
(his victim) and shave his head. The place of shaving is
round the Cairn, and that of slaughter anywhere on Mina, for
as said the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - 'Mina
is all a place of slaughter.' From then on, everything is permitted
to the pilgrim save women and scent (which he may
not indulge in) until he has done the ritual course of the return
to Mecca (al-ifadah).
After this Cairn of al-'Aqabah comes the Centre Cairn
[Jamrat al-Wasta] on which also a sign has been erected.
Between these two cairns he a bow-shot. After this comes the
First Cairn [al-Jumrah al-Ula], which is the same distance from
it as the other. At the sun's decline on the second day of the
Sacrifice seven stones are thrown on the First Cairn, and the
same number on both the Centre Cairn and the Cairn of al-
'Aqabah; a total of twenty-one stones. On the third day of the
Sacrifice, at the same time, a similar arrangement is followed,
giving forty-two stones in two days. These, with the seven
thrown at al-'Aqabah at sunrise on the Day of Sacrifice, as we
mentioned, and which released the pilgrims from the abstinence
from prohibited things save women and scent, bring the
number up to forty-nine stones. Following this, and after that
day, the pilgrims disperse to Mecca. In these times, dispense
is made with the twenty-one stones that were thrown on a
fourth day according to the same system. This is because of
182 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the haste of the pilgrims who fear the Bedouin tribe of Shu'-
biyyah and other dreaded trials, that cause the traditions of the
Sunni to be infringed. To-day the practice is carried out with
forty-nine stones, but in the past there were seventy. God
accepts the goodwill of His servants.73
The first thing that he who leaves 'Arafat for Mina will meet
is the First Cairn, then the Centre Cairn, and then the Cairn
of al-'Aqabah. On the Day of Sacrifice the Cairn of al-'Aqabah
comes singly and alone, with seven stones as has already been
mentioned. No other cairn shares (a stoning) that day. In the
two days that follow they adopt the system we have described
with the help of Great and Glorious God.
After the First Cairn, and deviating a little from the road,
is found the place of sacrifice of the Sacrificed One [Ishmael] -
may God bless and preserve him - where 'he was ransomed by
the sacrifice of a great victim' [Koran XXXVII, 107]. On the
blessed spot has been built a mosque which stands near the
foot of Mount Thabir. At the place of sacrifice, and fixed in
a wall built there, is a stone bearing the impressions of small
feet said to be the footprints of the Sacrificed One - may God
bless and preserve him - left there as he writhed. By the power
of Great and Glorious God the stone, in pity and sympathy,
softened to receive them, and men touch and kiss it that they
might be blessed thereby.
From there, one passes to the blessed mosque of al-Khayf
[the Declivity], which is at the end of Mina as you go, that is
to say the end of that part of it which contains structures. As
for the ancient ruins, they extend a very long way off, in front
of the mosque. This blessed mosque is of very wide extent,
like the biggest possible cathedral mosque. The minaret rises
in the middle of the court, and to the south it has four rows of
arcades covered by a single roof. This is one of the mosques
that are celebrated for their blessedness and the nobleness of
their site. It is enough that according to the venerable tradition
it is the immaculate place of burial of many prophets - God's
blessings upon them. Fast by this mosque, and to the right of
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (579) 183
the passer-by on this road, is a large stone resting on the side
of the mountain, standing high off the ground, and giving
shade to whoever may be under it. The story has it that the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve him-sat beneath its
shade, and that his revered head pressed against it whereupon
it softened to his touch and received an impression the size of
his head's circumference. Men hasten to put their heads in that
place, to obtain blessings and protection from the spot touched
by his revered head, that by the power of Great and Glorious
God the fires (of hell) should not touch them. When we had
finished our visit to this venerated shrine, we took our departure,
rejoicing at the favour that God had granted to us of
knowing it, and came to Mecca near midday. Praise be to God
for what He has bestowed (on us).
On the following Sunday, which was the 20th of Shawwal,
we climbed the sacred mountain of Hira to gain the blessings
of visiting the grotto on its summit where the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him - dedicated himself to God. It is
the place where first the revelation descended upon him - may
God bless and preserve him, and avail us of his intercessions,
including us in the number of his followers, and granting that
we may die according to his law and in his love. This by His
grace and favour. There is no Lord but He.
After sunrise on Tuesday the 22nd of the month, being the
6th of February, all the people assembled before the exalted
Ka'bah to pray for rain. The Qadi, who had summoned them,
had urged them to a fast of three days before it. And so they
assembled on this fourth day, having consecrated their aims
to Great and Glorious God. Early came the Shayba and opened
the venerated door of the Ancient House. Then the Qadi,
clothed in white, approached between his two black banners.
The maqam of the Friend (of God), Abraham - may God bless
and preserve him - was then brought forth and placed on the
threshold of the door of the venerated House, and the Koran
of 'Uthman-may God hold him in His favour-was taken
from its cupboard and opened beside the immaculate maqam,
184 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
one board, resting on it, and. the other on the venerated door.
All the people were then called to prayer, and the Qadi prayed
with them behind the Maqam in the place used as an oratory.
He prayed two rak'ah saying in the first, 'Glorify the name of
thy Lord, the Most High' [Koran LXXXVII, i], and in the
second reciting the surah of al-Ghashiyah [the Overwhelming:
Koran LXXXVIII].
He then ascended the pulpit, which had been set in its
appointed place beside the wall of the holy Ka'bah and delivered
an eloquent sermon in which he combined prayers for their
forgiveness of God, exhortations, and pious recollections, moving
their souls and rousing them to repentance and a return
to Great and Glorious God. The eyes of men ran dry of tears
and their lachrymatory ducts were exhausted of water. Their
cries rose high, and loud were their sobs and chokings.
He wrapped himself in his rida, as likewise did the congregation,
in observance of the tradition. They then dispersed, hopeful
and not despairing of the mercy of Great and Glorious God.
May He comfort His servants with His beneficence and bounty.
In this fashion he continued for three consecutive days to
pray with the people for rain, for dryness was sore afflicting
the inhabitants of the Hejaz. The drought had caused them
much damage, and the aridity had destroyed their flocks, for
in spring, autumn, and winter there had fallen nothing but
a little raining that was inadequate and brought no relief. But
Great and Glorious God is kind to His servants, punishing
them not for their sins. He is the Compassionate, the Benefactor.
There is no God but He.
On Thursday the 24th of Shawwal we ascended Jebel Thaur
to visit the blessed grotto where the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him-took refuge with his friend the Faithful
One [Abu Bakr] - may God hold him in His favour - as has
come down to us on the authority of the illustrious revelation
[Koran IX, 40]. Of this grotto and its description we have
already spoken in this journal. We entered it by a gap that is
difficult for some people to squeeze through, and acquired
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (579) 185
blessings by touching with our own bodies the place touched
by the blessed body - may God sanctify it - for by it the Prophet
-may God bless and preserve him-had entered the grotto.
One of the Egyptians who that day climbed to it suffered a
mortifying and ignominious experience for he sought to enter
by this narrow way, but could not by any means. Many times
he tried and failed, so that seeing him, men stopped and wept
in pity and had recourse to prayers to Great and Glorious God.
But this availed him nothing. There was one of them who was
stouter than he, and him God helped, causing men long to
wonder and reflect. After we had left that day, we learnt that
during it three persons had found themselves in this derogatory
state. God preserve us, in this life and in that to come, from
humiliating attitudes.
This mountain is most difficult to climb, taking away the
breath, and one cannot reach its summit without exhausting
and fatiguing the hands. It is three miles from Mecca, and
the same distance from Mount Hira'. May God, by His grace
and favour, deprive us not of the blessings of this shrine. The
grotto is eighteen spans long, and its width is eleven spans in
the middle and two-thirds of a span at the ends. Entrance is
made on to the middle. The width of the other entrance, whose
ingress is wider, is five spans; for as we have already said, the
grotto has two entrances.
On the following Friday the Yemenite Saru arrived in large
numbers on their way to visit the tomb of the Apostle - may
God bless and preserve him. According to their custom, they
brought provisions to Mecca, and the people of Mecca rejoiced
exceedingly at their coming, even deeming them a compensation
for the lack of rain. The benefactions of God to the dwellers
in His noble Haram are manifold, for He - Glory to Him - is
kind to His servants. There is no God but He.
The Month of Dhu 'l-Qa'dah (579)
[15th of February-i5th of March, 1184]
May God let us know His favour and blessings
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Wednesday,
corresponding with the 14th of February, and the
testimony of its observation was proved before the Qadi. The
greater part of the people in the sacred Mosque saw nothing of
it, although they stayed there watching until the end of the
sunset prayers. There were among them who imagined that
they observed it and who pointed towards it, but when their
claim was examined the vision disappeared and their information
was proved false. God best knows the truth of the matter.
This blessed month is the second of the sacred months and the
second of the months of the pilgrimage. May God, by His
power and compassion, bring forth this new moon upon
Muslims enjoying security and faith, together with His pardon
and His favour.
On Monday the 13 th of the month we entered the birthplace
of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. It is
(now) a superbly built mosque, and had been the house of
'Abdullah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib, the father of the Prophet -
may God bless and preserve him - of which we have already
spoken. The actual spot of his nativity has the likeness of a
small basin (in the floor), three spans wide, with in its centre
a green marble tablet, two-thirds of a span wide and encircled
by silver so that with this attached silver its width is one span.
We smoothed our cheeks on this holy spot which was the place
of delivery for the most illustrious child in the world, and which
was touched by the purest and most noble of offspring - may
God bless and preserve him, and advantage us with the blessings
of visiting the place of his birth. Beside it is a mihrab of
beautiful ornamental carvings, with a cornice worked with
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-QA'DAH (579) 187
gold. All this has been described before (by others). This blessed
spot is to the east of the Ka'bah and adjoins the side of the
mountain. Overlooking it close by is Jabal Abu Qubays, and
also near to it is a mosque on which is written: 'This mosque
is the birthplace of 'All ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him
in His favour - and here was nurtured the Apostle of God -
may God bless and preserve him. It was the house of Abi Talib,
uncle and guardian of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him.'
On the same day I entered the house of Khadijah the Great
[Muhammad's first wife] - may God hold her in His favour.
Here is the chamber of prophetic inspiration, and the birthplace
of Fatimah - may God hold her in His favour - which
is a small chamber, somewhat oblong. The actual place of
delivery has the likeness of a small basin (in the ground), with
a black stone in its centre. In this same house, contiguous to
the wall, were born al-Hasan and al-Husayn his sons - may
God hold them in His favour. The place of the delivery of
al-Hasan is beside that of al-Husayn, and over them are two
stones inclining to black that seem to be signs of the blessed
and noble birth sites. We smoothed our cheeks on these noble
places of delivery that have been privileged by the touch of
the bodies of these noble children - may God hold them in
His favour. Also in this venerated house is al-Makhtaba' [the
hiding place] of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - which is a sort of cell. In it is a seat deep in the ground
like a ditch and penetrating the wall a little. From the wall
projects a large stone that forms a sort of shade to the seat,
and that is said to have been the stone that covered the Prophet
-may God bless and preserve him-when he hid in that
place. The blessings of God be upon him, and upon those unspotted
ones of his family. Over each one of these places of
birth is a small movable wooden dome that protects them.
When a visitor comes, he puts it aside and touches the
noble spot to acquire blessings from it and then replaces the
dome.
188 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
On Friday the 24th of the month, the order of the Emir
Mukthir for the arrest of the chief of the Shayba, Muhammad
ibn Isma'il, and the raiding of his house, was executed. He was
dismissed from his custodianship of the sacred House - may
God keep it inviolate - for some defects charged against him
which were unbecoming in him who is entrusted with the
guardianship of the Ancient House. 'Whoever shall incline
therein to wrong injustly, him we shall cause to taste a painful
chastisement' [Koran XXII, 25]. May God protect us by His
favour from wrong judgement, and the piercings of the arrows
of (false) accusation.
In the foregoing days of this month, the Yemenite Saru were
arriving increasingly in many bands with provisions of food
and other things, and all manner of condiments and dried fruits.
They brought plenty to the city * * * *; and but for them the
continuing drought and the high prices would have reduced
it to distress and affliction. They were a mercy to this Safe
City [Mecca]. They then set forth on the blessed visit to the
sacred tomb in Taybah [Medina], the burial place of the Apostle
of God - may God bless and preserve him - arriving in a brief
space of time, for they covered the road from Mecca to Medina
in a few days. Those pilgrims who went with them praised
their company. While they were away, another party of them
arrived for the pilgrimage (in Mecca) only, and having no time
for the visit to Medina, they remained in Mecca. When those
of them who had visited Medina returned, even wide spaces
became constricted because of them.
On Monday the 27th of the month, the Ancient House was
opened. The one entrusted with the opening was a cousin of
the deposed Shayba and, according to report, of more exemplary
character. The Saru, as was their habit, thronged to enter,
but reached a state never known before, ascending in troops
until the venerated door was choked with them; and to go
forward or to retire they were unable. At last with the greatest
difficulty they entered; and then they came forth in haste and
the venerated door was too narrow for them. A group of them
THE MONTH OF DHU L-QA DAH (579) 189
would, go down the steps while another ascended and they
would meet and become entangled with each other.
Sometimes those descending would be borne on the breasts
of those coming up, and at times the climbers would be stopped
by those coming down and push until, losing balance, they
fell over each other. Those who watched them saw a shocking
sight for some of them were hurt, although some were not.
The greater part of them came down by jumping on men's
heads and necks. One of the most extraordinary things we saw
on that Monday was some of the Shayba going up at the time
of the crowding, seeking to enter the noble House and being
unable to get through. They clung to the curtains at the side
of the doorposts, and then one of them seized one of the hemp
ropes that hold the curtains and so rose over the heads and
necks and then trampled over them and thus entered the House.
He could find no other place to put his foot, such was the
crowding, piling up, and massing together. The like of the host
of Saru who arrived in this year had never been known in
the years before. God has the power to perform miracles. There
is no God but He.
On the same day, which was the 27th of the month of Dhu
'1-Qa'dah, the curtains of the holy Ka'bah were tucked up
about a man's stature and a half from the walls on all four
sides. They call this 'ihram and say 'the Ka'bah is in a state of
ihratn. This is the custom always throughout the months mentioned,
and the Ka'bah is not opened from the time of its
ihram until after the 'standing' (on Mount 'Arafat). It is as if
this tucking up (of the curtains of the Ka'bah) were a signal
to set forth on the (return) journey, and a warning of the
drawing nigh of the time to give the awaited farewell. God
grant that it be not our last farewell, and by His power and
glory, vouchsafe to us a return to it, and the easing of our way.
On Friday the 24th of the month, before this day we have
been speaking of, we seized the fleeting opportunity of some
relief in the crowding and entered the venerated House to make
our farewell. For after that it would be impossible to enter,
i9° THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
because of the continuous thronging of men, especially of the
foreigners who would arrive with the Emir of the 'Iraq pilgrimage.
One sees in them such a rush and press upon it, and
such a crowding inside, as to make one forget, such is their
rudeness and want of manners, the Yemenite Saru. Not one
of them is capable of a civility, much less anything else. May
Great and Glorious God grant in His grace and bounty that
this be not our final visit to His venerated House, and favour
us with a return to it in happiness and good health.
On the day on which the Ka'bah assumed the state of ihram,
the wooden dome was removed from its position over the
sacred maqam (of Abraham) and replaced by an iron dome in
readiness for these foreigners; for were it not of iron they would
eat it or do worse, such is their rude fervour for His holy shrine:
even throwing their persons on it. May God in His grace and
favour advantage them for their (good) intentions.
On Tuesday the 28th of the month, the deposed chief of the
Shayba, with display and ostentation, strode proudly between
his sons to the holy Ka'bah, bearing in his hand its key which
had been restored to him. He opened the venerated door and
mounted with his sons to the blessed roof by means of stout
hempen ropes secured to iron pegs driven into the roof and
hanging down to the ground where a form of wooden chair
is tied to them. In this (customarily) sits one of the Shayba
guardians of the House who, by the agency of pulleys provided
for that purpose, can be drawn to the roof-top and
undertake the mending of the tears in the curtains caused by
the wind. "We enquired how this deposed Shayba could be
restored to his office, the charges levelled against him. being
true, and we learnt that five hundred Meccan dinars had been
demanded from him. before he could resume it. This sum he
borrowed and paid. Long we marvelled and pondered over
this. "We discovered also that his arrest was not from jealous
care or indignation at the violation of God's Holy Places at
his hands, although his function is no less in honour than the
caliphate. But one circumstance resembles another. 'The unjust
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-QA'DAH (579) 191
are friends of each other' [Koran XLV, 19]. To God we should
complain of this clear corruption in even the most noble place
on the earth. Sufficient is He to us. He is our best Trustee.
On Wednesday the 29th of Dhu 1-Qa'dah, we entered the
house of Al-Khayzuran, which is the place whence sprang
Islam. It is beside al-Safa, and adjoining it, and to the right of
him who enters it is a small chamber that was the dwelling
of Bilal - may God hold him in His favour. The house is
approached across a large courtyard, like that of a caravanserai,
enclosed by chambers that are hired to pilgrims. This venerated
house is small and found to the left of him who enters the
courtyard. It has been restored by Jamal al-Din, whom we
have mentioned in this journal as leaving generous tracings of
himself, and who spent on it about a thousand dinars. May
God advantage him for his past good deeds. To the right of
him who enters the blessed house is a door by which one enters
a large and splendidly built dome in which is the place where
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - sat, and the
stone against which he leant. To his right is the place of Abu
Bakr the Faithful, and to the right of Abu Bakr is the place
of 'Ah ibn Abi Talib together with this stone against which
he leant, and which is in the wall in the form of a mihrab. In
this house 'Umar ibn al-Khattab embraced Islam, and from it,
at his hand, the faith spread, while God made it illustrious from
there. May God advantage us with the blessedness of this
venerated shrine and august monument, and grant that we may
die in the love of those who through them have been honoured,
and who all are fitted for the benedictions of God.
The Month of Dhu 'l-Hijjah ($jg)
[16th of March-i3th of April, 1184]
May God let us know of His blessings
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Thursday,
corresponding with the 15th of March. In the watching for
it the people were involved in a strange circumstance, and a
remarkable fabrication; and a false utterance almost provoked
the stones, not to mention else, to rebut and deny it. It happened
in this wise. They were watching for the appearance of
the new moon on the night of Thursday the 30th of the month.
On the horizon the air had thickened and the clouds had piled
up when, with the sunset, a faint glimmering of red appeared.
Eagerly the people yearned for some break in the clouds that
their eyes might catch a glimpse of the new moon. While they
were about this, one of them cried, 'God is Great,' and the
vast concourse followed him and cried, 'God is Great,' rising
to behold what they could not see, and pointing at what they
only imagined, such was their eagerness that the standing on
Mount 'Arafat should fall on Friday. As if the pilgrimage must
be tied to that precise day. They therefore forged the false
testimonies; and a party of Maghrabis - may God prosper their
affairs - together with some Egyptians and their chiefs went
to the Qadi and testified that they had seen it. He answered
them most harshly, and peremptorily rejected their evidence;
and in declaring their statements spurious he put them to the
greatest shame, saying, 'Wonder of wonders! Did one of you
affirm that he had seen the sun under such thickly woven clouds
I would not accept his affirmation. How then can I believe
that you saw a new moon that is twenty-nine nights old.'74
Amongst other things he said was: 'The Maghrabis are disordered.
A hair from the eyebrow comes in sight, and with
fancy's eye they deem it to be the new moon.' This Qadi,
THE MONTH OF DHU L-HIJJAH (579) 193
Jamal al-Din, displayed in this matter of the false testimony
firmness and prudence, so that the learned praised him and the
wise thanked him. And well might they do so, for the rights
of the pilgrimage are of great consequence to Muslims who
come to them 'from every remote path' [Koran XXII, 27]. If
complaisance were shown, zeal would be impaired and unsound
thought admitted. May God by His favour raise all
obscurities and their evils.
On the night of this Friday the new moon appeared during
a break in the clouds, clothed in the radiance of the thirtieth
night. The crowds then raised tremendous shouts and proclaimed
that the 'standing' (on Mount 'Arafat) would take
place on Friday, crying, 'Praise be to God who did not render
vain our efforts or bring to nought our proposals,' as if it were
a truth with them that if the standing did not fall upon a Friday
it would not be acceptable to God, nor could God's mercy
be hoped for or expected. But God is above that. On Friday
they met before the Qadi and gave testimony as to the truth
of its being seen, making truth to weep and falsehood to
chuckle. But he put aside their evidence and said, 'Until when,
O ye people, will ye persist in your ardour, and until when
will ye pursue the paths of error?' and let them know that he
had asked leave of the Emir Mukthir that the ascent to 'Arafat
be made on the morning of Friday. They would stand on
'Arafat in the evening and on the morning of the following
Saturday, and would pass the night at Muzdalifah. If the 'standing'
were done on Friday, there would be no objection to their
delaying the passing of the night in Muzdalifah, this being permitted
by Muslim imams. If it took place on the Saturday,
they would pass the night at Muzdalifah, and be favoured
therein. But if they decided on Friday, the Muslims would be
deceived and their rights corrupted, for the 'standing' on the
Day of Tarwiyah75 [8th of Dhu 1-Hijjah] is not considered
lawful by the imams, whereas it is by them considered lawful
on the Day of Sacrifice [odi of Dhu '1-Hijjah]. All those present
thanked the Qadi for his conduct of the enquiry and prayed
194 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
for him, and the laity who were there revealed their approval
and departed in peace. Praise be to God for that.
This blessed month is the third of the sacred months. The
first ten days are those in which the people assemble. It is the
great period of the pilgrimage, the month of cries [of labbayka,
'Here am I, O Lord'] and of the flowing of blood [Sacrifice],
and the time when from all lands and ways the deputations
to God [pilgrims] do meet. It is the target of God's mercy and
blessings, and (the monda) in which occurs the solemn 'standing'
on 'Arafat. May God by His favour and bounty, grant
that we be of those who during it win benefits, and divest us
of the raiment of sin and transgressions. For He is at once the
All-Powerful and the Forgiving.
The Emir (of the pilgrimage) from 'Iraq awaited the clearing
in men's minds of the confusion surrounding this matter,
and it may be, God willing, that the truth of the matter was
already clear to him.
During all these days, and in those that followed, there arrived
companies of Yemenite Saru and pilgrims from divers lands,
in numbers beyond count save by Him who watches the terms
of their lives, and their sustenance. There is no God but He.
A manifest miracle is that this Safe City [Mecca], which lies
in a valley bed that is a bow-shot or less in width, can contain
this vast host; a host such that were it brought into the greatest
of cities it could not be contained. This venerated city, in what
concerns it of manifest miracles, namely its expansion for multitudes
beyond count, is described only by the true analogy of
the ulema [learned doctors of divinity] that its enlargement for
newcomers is that of a uterus for the foetus. So it is with 'Arafat
and the other great shrines in this sacred land. May God with
His grace and bounty increase its sanctity, and in it grant to
us His mercy.
From the beginning of this blessed month die drums of the
Emir Mukthir were beaten morning and evening and at the
hours of prayer, as a sign that this was the solemn period of
the pilgrimage. So it continued until the day of the ascent to
THE MONTH OF DHU L-HIJJAH (579) 195
'Arafat - may God accord, us there the acceptance of our prayers
and the extension of His mercy.
On Monday the fourth or fifth of this month there arrived
the Emir 'Uthman ibn 'Ah, the governor of Aden, who had
left it in flight before Sayf al-Islam who was moving on the
Yemen. He had put to sea in many ships \jilab] laden with
great treasures and monies beyond computation so abundant
were they. For he had long been governor of that province,
and his acquisitions had been extensive. But while he was disembarking
at a place called Sr * * * * his ships were overtaken
by the fire-ships [harariq] of the Emir Sayf al-Islam and all die
heavy treasures had been seized. The lighter objects of worth
and value he carried away with him to the shore, accompanied
by a number of his men and slaves, and arrived in safety at
Mecca in a camel caravan laden with belongings and money.
Under the eyes of the people this was taken into a house that
he had earlier caused to be built, after sending before him by
night the most precious of his treasures and the money he had
to his hand, together with a party of slaves and servants. To
be short, it is impossible to describe the abundance and amplitude
of his state. The part that was seized from him was the
greater, for he was described during his governorship as dealing
ill with the merchants, all the profits of commerce going
to him. The treasures brought from India came wholly to his
hands, so that he acquired vast illicit profits and attained die
treasures of Qarun.76 But die vicissitudes of time have begun
to reduce him, and he knows not how his case will be with
Saladin. This world destroys all those who love it most, and
its sons it devours. The reward of God is the best treasure, and
obedience to Him is the most noble booty. There is no God
but He.
The question of testimony as to (the sighting) of the blessed
and felicitous new moon continued to provoke anxiety until
repeated news of its being seen was received on the night of
Thursday, which corresponds with the 15th of March. Evidence
of this was given by some devout and God-fearing men
196 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of trust among the Yemenites, and others who had arrived from
Medina the venerated. But the Qadi persisted in his firmness
and refusal to accept (this evidence) and in his determination
to defer the matter until a messenger should arrive giving news
of the arrival of the Emir of the 'Iraq (Pilgrimage); for he
wished to know from this envoy the views of the Emir of the
pilgrimage upon the matter. And on Wednesday the 7th, the
messenger arrived. The minds of the Meccans were filled with
apprehension at his delay, being fearful of the rancour of
the Caliph towards their Emir, Mukthir, for some reprehensible
actions he had committed. The arrival of this messenger
reassured and calmed their frightened souls, for he came with
pleasant countenance and good grace. He gave notice that the
new moon had been seen on the night of Thursday. The news
passed from one to the other and was confirmed before the
Qadi, thus obliging him to deliver the khutbah that day, in
accordance with the established custom, the 7th of Dhu '1-
Hijjah after the midday prayers. In this sermon he advised the
people of the rites they should observe, and told them that the
morrow, being Yaum al-Tarwiyah, would be the day of their
ascent to Mina, and that the 'standing' (on Mount 'Arafat)
would be observed on Friday. He reminded them that the
venerated tradition that comes directly from the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him-has it that a 'standing' on this
day is equivalent to seventy on any other, and that the superiority
of a year in which this standing (falls on a Friday) is as
the superiority of Friday over all the other days (of the week).
Early on the morning of Thursday the people began their
ascent to Mina, and thence passed on to 'Arafat. It is the rule
that the night should be passed there, but perforce they omitted
this in fear of the Banu Shu'bah, who make raids on the pilgrims
on their way to 'Arafat. The Emir 'Uthman, of whom
we have already spoken, displays much zeal in this matter, even
waging holy war against them, for which we hope for him,
if God so wills, the forgiveness of his sins. He goes forth, with
all his companions bristling with weapons, to the gorge between
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 197
Muzdalifah and 'Arafat, which is the place where the road is
hemmed in by two mountains from one of which, being that
which is to the left of him who goes to 'Arafat, the Shu'bah
descend upon the pilgrims and plunder them. The Emir raised
a pavilion in this gorge between the two mountains, after one
of bis companions had gone before (to reconnoitre) and had
climbed to the top of the mountain on his horse. The mountain
is difficult of ascent, and we marvelled at his achievement, and
even more so at that of his horse which was able to climb that
difficult slope that * * * * could not climb. All the pilgrims
felt secure in the company of this Emir who earned two
rewards; one for the holy war, and one for the pilgrimage,
since the safeguarding of those who came in deputation [pilgrimage]
to Great and Glorious God on such a day, has the
merit of the greatest holy war.
The ascent of the people continued all that day, all night,
and all Friday so that there was assembled on 'Arafat a multitude
whose numbers could not be counted save by Great and
Glorious God. Muzdalifah lies between Mina and 'Arafat; from
Mina to Muzdalifah lies the same distance as from Mecca to
Mina, which is about five miles; and from Muzdalifah to
'Arafat is the same or a little more. Muzdalifah is also called
al-Mash'ar al-Haram [the place of ritual ceremonies] as well
as Jam [reunion], and therefore has three names. Before
coming to it, about a mile away, is the Wadi [valley of]
Muhassir, which it is the custom to pass through with a brisk
step. It is the boundary between Muzdalifah and Mina, for it
lies between them. Muzdalifah is a wide stretch of land between
two mountains, and around it are the reservoirs and cisterns
that were used for water in the time of Zubaydah - may God's
mercy rest upon her soul. In the middle of this plain is an
enclosure at whose centre is a rounded knoll on the top of
which is a mosque that is approached by steps on both sides.
Men crowd as they climb up to it and at the prayers inside it,
the night they pass at Muzdalifah.
'Arafat also is a wide plain, and if it were men's place of
M
iy% THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
congregation on the Day of Resurrection it could contain them
all. This broad plain is enfolded by many mountains, and at its
extremity is the Jabal al-Ramah [Mount of Mercy] on and
around which is the standing ground of the pilgrims. The 'Two
Signs' [Al-'Alaman] come about two miles before this place,
and the area stretching from the 'Two Signs' to 'Arafat is
neutral [lit. lawful' hill], while that on the hither side is sacred.
Near to them on the 'Arafat side, is the valley of 'Uranah,
from which place the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him. - has enjoined that avoidance be made by saying, ' 'Arafat
is all a standing ground. But turn aside from the valley of
'Uranah.' He who 'stands' there invalidates his pilgrimage, and
this should be kept in mind, for on the evening of the 'standing'
the camel-masters often hurry many pilgrims, making them
apprehensive of the crowding in the return from 'Arafat and
taking them down by the 'Two Signs' that face them, until
they come to the valley of'Uranah or overreach it and so annul
their pilgrimage. The prudent will not therefore leave his standing
ground on 'Arafat until the disc of the sun has completely
subsided.
The Mount of Mercy rises in the middle of the plain, apart
from the other mountains. It consists wholly of separate blocks
of (granite) stone and it is difficult of ascent. Jamal al-Din,
whose memorable works we have already mentioned in this
journal, provided on its four sides low steps that can be climbed
by laden beasts, and spent great sums upon it. At its summit
is a cupola that is attributed to Umm Salimah - may God hold
her in His favour - but it is not certain whether this is true.
In the centre of the cupola is a mosque into which men crowd
to pray, and around this venerated mosque runs a terrace, broad
and handsome to look upon, that overlooks the plain of'Arafat.
To the south is a wall against which are erected the mihrabs
that the people pray in. At the foot of this sacred mountain,
to the left of him who looks towards the qiblah [direction of
Mecca], is a house of ancient construction in whose upper part
is a vaulted upper chamber, attributed to Adam-may God
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 199
bless and preserve him. On the left of this house, facing the
qiblah, is the rock beside which was the standing ground of the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and it is on a small
hill. Around the Mount of Mercy and this venerated house
are water cisterns and wells. Also to the left of the house and
near to it is a small mosque. Fast by the 'Two Signs', and to
the left on him who faces the qiblah, is an ancient mosque of
large proportions, of which the south wall that is named after
Abraham-may God bless and preserve him-remains. The
preacher delivers a sermon in it on the day of the 'standing',
and then leads the combined midday and afternoon prayers.
Also to the left of the 'Two Signs', when facing the qiblah,
is the Wadi 1-Arak [the valley of the Thorn Tree, Salvadora
persica] which is the green thorn that stretches before the eye
a long way over the plain.
The assembling of the people on 'Arafat is completed during
Thursday and all the night of Friday. Near the third part of
this night of Friday, the Emir of 'Iraq pilgrimage arrived and
pitched his tent in the wide plain that, for him who faces qiblah,
is contiguous with the right side of the Mount of Mercy. The
qiblah, relative to 'Arafat, is to the west, for the sacred Ka'bah
is in that direction.
Upon that Friday morning there was on 'Arafat a multitude
that could have no like save that which there will be on the
Day of Resurrection; but, within the will of God Most High,
it was a gathering that will win reward, giving promise as it
does of God's mercy and forgiveness when men assemble for
the Day of Reckoning. Some truth-demanding sheiks of the
mujawir [settled pilgrims] asserted that never had they seen on
'Arafat a more numerous concourse, and I do not believe that
since the time of al-Rashid, who was the last Caliph to make
the pilgrimage, there had ever been such a concourse in Islam.
May God by His favour grant that it bring mercy and immunity
from sin.
When, on Friday, the midday and afternoon prayers were
said together, the people stood contrite and in tears, humbly
200 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
beseeching the mercy of Great and Glorious God. The cries
of 'God is Great' rose high, and loud were the voices of men
in prayer. Never has there been seen a day of such weeping,
such penitence of heart, and such bending of the neck in reverential
submission and humility before God. In this fashion the
pilgrims continued, with the sun burning their faces, until its
orb had sunk and the time of the sunset prayers was at hand.
The Emir of the Pilgrimage had arrived with a number of his
soldiers clad in mail, and they stood near the rocks beside the
little mosque already mentioned. The Yemenite Saru took up
position in their appointed stations on Mount 'Arafat, places
that, by successive inheritance from their ancestors, they had
occupied since the days of the Prophet - may God bless and
preserve him; and no tribe of them encroached upon the station
of another. Their numbers this year were such as had never
been equalled before. Likewise the Emir of 'Iraq arrived with
a great host such as had never come before; and with him came
foreign Emirs from Khurasan, high-born ladies called Khawatin,
which in the singular is 'Khatun', and many ladies daughters
of emirs, together with those from other lands in countless
numbers, all of whom took up their posts.
For their return from 'Arafat, they had appointed the Malikite
imam as their guide and model, for the practice of Malik - may
God hold him in His favour - demands that there should be
no departure from 'Arafat until the sun's disc has fallen below
the horizon and the time for sunset prayers has come. Yet some
of the Yemenite Saru had taken their leave before this. So when
the time had come, the Malikite imam gave the sign with his
hands and descended from his post. The people then pressed
forward on their return with such a surge that the earth trembled
and the mountains quaked. What a standing it had been,
how awesome to regard and what hopes of happy reward it
had brought to the soul. God grant that we may be among
those on whom He there conferred His approbation and covered
with His bounty. For He is bounteous, generous, compassionate,
and beneficent.
THE MONTH OF DHU L-HIJJAH (579) 201
The encampment of this Emir of'Iraq was beautiful to look
upon and superbly provided, with large handsome tents and
erections, and wonderful pavilions and awnings, and of an
aspect such that I have never seen more remarkable. The
grandest camp to look upon was that of the Emir, for it was
surrounded by a linen screen, like a wall to form a sort of
closed-in garden or an ornamented building. Within this were
the pitched pavilions, all black on a white background and
dappled and variegated as if they were flowers in a garden.
The faces of the four sides of the screen were wholly covered
with forms of black shields painted on the white (linen) such
as to startle the beholder, who might conceive them to be
shields on steeds covered with embroidered horse-cloths. In
these wall-like screens were tall doors, like those of lofty castles,
through which one entered into vestibules and mazes, passing
from them into the open ground where stood the pavilions.
It is as if this Emir lives in a walled city that moves when he
moves and settles when he settles. It is a piece of regal splendour,
the like of which is never seen with western kings. Within
the doors are the Emir's chamberlains, his servants, and his
followers. So high are these doors, that a horseman might come
with his banner and pass through them without mclining or
stooping his head. All this erection was held firm by thick linen
cords connected with pegs driven (into the ground), and the
whole was arranged with remarkable constructional skill. The
other Emirs who came in the company of the Emir of 'Iraq
had camps of less magnificence, but they were all similar in
style, with splendid pavilions of uncommon form set up like
poised crowns, and such as to take long to describe and to
consume many words so great was the magnificence of this
encampment in equipment, furnitures, and the like. All this
indicates amplitude of circumstances and a great profusion of
wealth and riches.
In their journeys on camel, they are shaded by canopies, handsome
to look upon and of unusual shape, that are erected over
wooden Utters which they call qashawat. These are like hollow
202 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
biers, and to those men and women who ride in them are as
cradles to infants, being filled with soft: mattresses on which
the traveller may sit in comfort as though he were in a soft
and commodious bed. Opposite him, in the other half of the
litter, sits in counterpoise his man or woman companion, and
over them both spreads the canopy. Thus, all unconscious of
the movement, they journey on, slumbering and doing as they
will. When they arrive at their place of alighting, upon the
instant their screens are set up if they are people of easy and
luxurious means, and they enter still riding. Steps are then
brought to them and they descend, passing from the shade of
the litter's canopy to that of their resting place without any
breath of wind o'ertaking them or being touched by any ray
of sun. Enough for you of this luxuriousness. In their journeys,
however long, they are put to no distress or weariness; and
in the continual pitching and striking of camps, they have no
fatigue to endure. Less comfortable than these were those
who rode in maharat, which resemble the shaqadif already
described in our account of the desert of 'Aydhab; but the
shaqadif are larger and ampler, these being more compact
and less commodious. But they also have shades as protection
against the heat of the sun. As for him. whose means
fall short of these conveniences of travel, he must bear the
fatigues of the way which are but a part of the chastisements
(of God).
We return to complete our narrative concerning the return
[«d/ar] from 'Arafat on the evening of the standing there. The
people departed after the sun had set as we have said, and in
the late evening came to Muzdalifah, where they recited the
combined sunset and early night prayers according to the rule
laid down by the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him.
Throughout the night the Ma'shar al-Haram [Muzdalifah] was
inuminated by candle-wick lamps. As for the mosque which
we mentioned before, it was all light, seeming to the beholder
as if all the stars of the sky shone upon it. After the same fashion
was the Mount of Mercy and its mosque on the night of Friday;
THE MONTH OF DHU L-HIJJAH (579) 203
for these foreigners from Khurasan, and others among the
'Iraqis, are the most zealous of men in bringing candles in great
numbers that these venerated shrines might be irradiated.
Because of them, the Haram had the same aspect throughout
their stay. Each one of them would enter it with a candle in
his hand, and most would go to the hatim of the Hanafke imam,
for they were of that rite. One huge candle like a cypress tree
we saw 'that would be a burden to a troop of mighty men'
[Koran XXVIII, 76] and which was set before the Hanafite
imam. That night which was the night of Saturday, men spent
in al-Ma'shar al-Haram, and when they had said the morning
prayer, they early left it for Mina. They stood and prayed (upon
the way), for all Muzdalifah is standing ground save the valley
of Muhassir, where one must move speedily [harwala] in the
direction of Mina until emerging from it. At Muzdalifah most
of the pilgrims provide themselves with stones (to cast at) the
cairns. This is the more favoured custom, but there are others
who collect them from around the mosque of al-Khayf in
Mina, and it is as they wish.
When the pilgrims arrived at Mina they made speed to throw
seven stones on the Cairn of' Aqabah and then slaughtered in
sacrifice, after which it became lawful for them to do everything
save (to have contact with) women and (to use) scent,
(from which they must still abstain) until they have performed
the tawajoithe ifadah [return to Mecca]. This cairn was stoned
at the rising of the sun on the Day of Sacrifice, and most of
the pilgrims then left to do the tawaf of the ifadah. Some of
them stayed until the second day, and some until the third,
which is the day of the descent to Mecca. The second day,
following the Day of Sacrifice, at the declension of the sun,
the pilgrims cast seven stones at the First Cairn, and then did
the same at the Centre Cairn, stopping at both for prayers.
They did the same at the Cairn of al-'Aqabah, but did not
stop here, imitating in all this the actions of the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him. The Cairn of the 'Aqabah is stoned
last on these two days; but on the Day of the Sacrifice it is
204 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the first and. only cairn to be stoned, the others not being
associated with it on that day.
The day following the Day of Sacrifice, after the casting of
the stones, the khatib preached a sermon in the mosque of
al-Khayf, and then conducted the combined midday and afternoon
prayers. This khatib came with the 'Iraqi Emir, being
delegated by the Caliph to deliver the khutbah and to discharge
the duties of Qadi in Mecca as it is said. His name is Taj al-Din.
It became clear that he was dull and stupid; his discourse
revealed this, and his speech did not observe the rules of
grammatical analysis. On the third day, the pilgrims hastened to
descend to Mecca. They had completed the throwing of fortynine
stones, seven on the Day of Sacrifice at al-'Aqabah which
are those that release from abstentions, twenty-one on the
second day, after the declension of the sun with seven at each
cairn, and the same number on the third day, returning then
to Mecca. Some there were who said the afternoon prayers in
the bed of the torrent, others in the sacred Mosque, and some
had made haste and said the midday prayers in the torrent bed.
It had anciently been the practice to stay at Mina three days
after the Day of Sacrifice in order to complete the throwing
of seventy stones. But in these times it is despatched in two
days in accordance with the saying of God - may He be blessed
and exalted - 'Whoso hasteneth (his departure) two days,
it is no sin for him; and whoso delayeth, it is also no sin
for him.' [Koran II, 203]. This is done in fear of the Banu
Shu'bah and what might be sprung on them by the Meccan
robbers.
On the day of the descent, there occurred dissension and riot
between the negro inhabitants of Mecca and the Turks of'Iraq
in which there were some hurts. Swords were drawn, arrow
notches were put to the bow-string, and spears were thrown,
while some of the goods of the merchants were plundered.
Mina in those three days is one of the greatest of markets,
and in it are sold wares ranging from precious jewels to
the cheapest strings of beads, together with other articles
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 205
and various merchandises of the world, for it is the meeting
place of men from all lands. God preserved us from the
evils of this disturbance, and speedily brought calm. Thus
ended this successful standing upon 'Arafat, and the faithful
had ended their pilgrimage. Praise be to God, Lord of the
Universe.
On Saturday, which was the Day of Sacrifice, the Kiswah
['Robe' or covering] of the holy Ka'bah was conveyed on four
camels from the encampment of the 'Iraqi Emir to Mecca.
Before it walked the new Qadi, wearing the black vestment
given him by the Caliph, preceded by banners and followed
by rolling drums. A cousin of the (late) Shayba (chief), one
Muhammad ibn Isma'il, went with it, for it was reported that
the Caliph's decree regarding the chief's deposal from the custodianship
of the House on account of some notorious actions
had been executed. May God by His favour purify His venerated
House at the hands of whom He wishes amongst His servants.
This cousin followed a more becoming path and behaved with
more exemplariness, as we have already mentioned when referring
to the first deposal. The Kiswah was placed on the venerated
roof of the Ka'bah, and on Tuesday the 13 th of the blessed
month the Shaybites were busily employed in draping it. It
was of a ripe green colour, and held the eyes in spell for its
beauty. In its upper part it had a broad red band (that ran
around the Ka'bah), and on the side that faces the venerated
Maqam, the side that has the venerated door and that is blessed,
there was written on this band, after the Bismillah [the invocation
'In the name of God'] the words 'Surely the first Sanctuaryappointed
for mankind (was that at Bekkah [Mecca])' [Koran
III, 95]. On the other sides was written the name of the Caliph
with invocations in his favour. Running round the band were
two reddish zones with small white roundels containing inscriptions
in fine characters that included verses from the Koran as
well as mentions of the Caliph. The clothing (of the Ka'bah)
was completed and the venerated hems of the Kiswah were
tucked up to protect them from the hands of the foreigners
206 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
who pull them violently and throw themselves impetuously
upon them. To the beholder the Ka'bah then presented the
most comely sight, appearing as an unveiled bride in the finest
green silk-brocade. May God by His favour, grant that it might
be seen by all who yearn to come to it, and long to gather
around it.
In these times the venerated House is opened daily for the
foreigners of'Iraq and Khurasan and for those others who arrive
with the 'Iraq Emir. The throngings of these men, the way in
which they hurled themselves upon the noble door, their collisions
with each other, and the swimming of some over the
heads of the others as if they were in a pool of water, was
something that never more horrible was seen and that led to
destruction of life and breaking of limbs. During all this they
were unmindful of everything and never rested; rather, in an
excess of emotion and animation, they hurled themselves upon
that venerated House as do moths upon a lamp. The manner
of the entry of the Yemenite Saru into the blessed House in
the fashion we have described was staid and composed compared
with that of these barbarous-tongued foreigners. Yet
may God advantage them for their intentions. In that dreadful
press, there perished amongst them those whose allotted term
of life had come to its end. May God give pardon to them all.
Sometimes a group of their women would enter the press and
emerge 'with their skins burned' [Koran IV, 56], baked by the
squeezings of a struggle that is inflamed by the gasps of emotion
and ecstasy. May God, by His favour, advantage them all for
their faith and sound intention.
On the night of Thursday the 15 th of the blessed month,
after the nightfall prayers ['atamah] the preaching pulpit was
set before the Maqam, and it was mounted by a preacher from
Khurasan, a man of handsome countenance and graceful gestures.
He used both the Arabic and the Persian tongues, employing
them together with a lawful magic77 of rhetoric, an
eloquence of language, and a distinction of expression. He then
addressed his discourse to the Persians, using their tongue and
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 207
causing them to shake with emotion and to melt in sighs and
sobs. The following night another pulpit was placed behind
the Hanafite hatim, and, also after the nightfall prayers, it was
mounted by a white-moustachioed sheik of impressive dignity
who was outstandingly distinguished in grace and perfection.
He delivered a sermon through which he strung, word by
word, the verse of 'The Throne' [Koran II, 256], employing
all forms of exhortatory exposition, and dealing with all
branches of knowledge. Also in this he used both languages,
moving hearts to rapture, and, after overwhelming them, setting
them on fire with emotion. Throughout all this he was
assailed by the arrows of interrogation, and these he met with
the shield of ready and exhaustive reply, so that minds were
ravished by him, and spirits were possessed with wonder and
admiration for him. It was as if he was by God inspired. In
this manner the preachers of these eastern lands meet their
inquisition and the copious shower of questions that fall upon
them. It is a remarkable performance that very clearly revealed
their rare qualities and expresses the enchantment of their discourse;
and this not in one single branch of learning but in
many. At times men would seek to confuse and distract
them with questions, but they would give their answer
with the speed of Hghtning, and in the twinkling of an eye.
Superiority is in the hand of God, who grants it to whom He
wins.
In front of these preachers stood reciters intoning the Koran
with harmonies that would win over things inanimate, for in
feeling and liveliness they were as the psalms of David.78 And
none in that assembly knew what to admire most. Verily
God gives wisdom to whom He wills. There is no God but
He. I listened to this preacher sheik, who in support of a
tradition (concerning the Prophet) quoted five ancestors
in uninterrupted succession, the one after the other, from
his father back. Each had borne a cognomen that had
indicated his position in the world of learning and his standing
as a recaller of pious memories and a preacher. Our sheik
208 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
was immersed in his noble calling, where the glory was
hereditary.
Throughout all the days of the festival, the sacred Mosque -
may God preserve it free from imperfection and exalt i t -
became a great market in which were sold commodities ranging
from flour to agates, and from wheat to pearls, and including
many other things of merchandise. The sale of flour was done
in the Dar al-Nadwah [House of Counsel], on that side of the
Mosque where stands the Banu Shayba Gate. But the greater
part of the market was in the colonnade that runs from
west to north and in that which runs from north to east.
That this is forbidden by divine law is known. 'God is the
master of His affairs' [Koran XII, 21]. There is no God
but He.
On the evening of Sunday the 20th of the month, corresponding
with the 1st of April79 [3rd of April], we set forth
(from Mecca) to the encampment of the Emir of 'Iraq in al-
Zahir, some two miles from the city. We had completed our
arrangements for the hire (of transport) to Mosul, which is ten
days'journey north of Baghdad. May God by His favour grant
that we know prosperity and happiness (upon our way). Three
days we tarried in al-Zahir, and on each of them we returned
to the Ancient House that we might bid farewell again. But
on the forenoon of Thursday the 22nd of the month of Dhu
'l-Hijjah we removed from our encampment, and journeyed
at a sober and easy pace on account of the slowness and lagging
of some of our number. We alighted in the neighbourhood
of Batn Marr, some eight miles distant from the place we
had left. God by His favour will guarantee our safety and
protection.
Our stay in Mecca - may God sanctify it - from the day of
our arrival, which was Thursday the 13 th of Rabi' al-Akhir
of the year 579 [4th of August, 1183], to the day on which
we departed from al-Zahir which was Thursday the 22nd of
Dhu '1-Hijjah of the same year [5th of April, 1184], was in
all eight and a third months which, taking count of their greater
THE MONTH OF DHU AL-HIJJAH (579) 209
and shorter lengths, amounted to two hundred and forty-five
felicitous and blessed days. May God by His favour hold them
in our count as showing our regard for Him and make them
acceptable according to His pleasure. Throughout this time,
we were away from the sight of the venerated House (but)
three days: the Day of 'Arafah, the following Day of
Sacrifice, and Wednesday the 21st of Dhu '1-Hijjah, preceding
the Thursday on which we left al-Zahir. May God by His
favour grant that it be not the last visit to His venerated
Haram.
It was after the midday prayers on Thursday that we left
al-Zahir for Batn Marr, which is a fertile valley with many
palm-trees and possessing a spring whose abundant waters irrigate
the land of that district. In this valley is a broad territory,
containing many villages and springs, from which fruits are
brought to Mecca - may God defend it. We paused there on
Friday for a curious reason concerning the royal khatun, daughter
of the Emir Mas'ad, Lord of Darub [Cilician Gates], of
Armenia, and of the regions contiguous with Bilad al-Rum
['The land of the Greeks', though usually and here applied to
the Anatolian frontier province of the Byzantine empire]. She
was one of the three khatuns who had come on the pilgrimage
with the Emir of the Pilgrimage, Abu 1-Mukarim Tashtikin,
an officer of the Prince of the Faithful sent each year by the
Caliph, and who had discharged this function for eight years
or more. This princess held the most consequence between them
on account of the size of her father's dominions. The cause of
our mentioning her is that on the night of Friday she had left
Bam Marr, betaking herself with her personal servants and
retinue to Mecca, so that on Friday she was missing from her
place (in the encampment). The Emir Abu '1-Mukarim despatched
from his personal retinue men of trust who might seek
knowledge from her regarding her return, and set men who
should await her. She returned at nightfall on Saturday, and
the arrows of conjecture flew at random concerning the cause
of the departure of this much indulged princess, while conceits
2io THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
were adduced that might bring out her close-kept secret.
Some declared that she left in remonstrance for something she
disapproved of in the Emir, others that it was the promptings
of a yearning to be near (the Sacred Mosque) that had inclined
her to that venerated place of meeting. But none can know
such hidden things save God, and however the case may be,
He is enough to repair the idleness she has occasioned, and
to speed the pilgrims on their way. Praise be to Him for
that.
The father of this woman is, as we have said, the Emir
Mas'ud. His realm is large, and wide is his sway. More than
one hundred thousand horsemen, so we were assured, ride at
his command, and for his son-in-law through this princess, Nur
air-Din, Lord of Amid and of other lands, ride about twelve
thousand cavaliers. This princess has provided many good works
upon the pilgrim road, among them being public water supplies,
furnishing thirty water-bearing beasts for this purpose,
and a similar number for provisions. With her she brought
around a hundred camels especially to bear clothing, provisions,
and other things. Indeed, it would take long to describe her
state. Her age is about five and twenty years. The second
khatun, mother of Mu'izz al-Din Lord of Mosul, has as husband
Babek the brother of Nur al-Din who was Lord of
Syria - may God have mercy on his soul. She also has many
pious works to her name. The third khatun is the daughter
of al-Daqus [Tukush Shah] Lord of Isbahan in the land of
Khurasan.80 She also is of great consequence and impressive
circumstance, and is much given to good work. And in all
three is this most strange admixture of pious work and regal
pride.
We removed at noon on Saturday the 24th of Dhu 1-Hijjah,
and came to rest not far from 'Usfan, moving on towards that
place at midnight, and arriving there early on the morning of
Sunday. It lies in a plain between mountains, and possesses
spring wells named after 'Uthman - may God hold him in His
favour. Here are many muql trees [Bdellium; Gr. (35sAAiov, a
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 211
fragrant gum],81 and a deserted, fortress of ancient construction,
with lofty towers, on which time has left its prints and which,
through rare inhabitation and continuing decay, has fallen into
ruin. We passed some miles beyond it, and then dismounted
to repose and take our midday slumber. After the midday
prayer we set forward to Khulays, arriving there at eventide.
This place also lies in an ample plain, and has many palmgroves
and a mountain at whose summit is a towering fortress.
In the plain is another fortress on which decay has left its trace.
Khulays has a spring of abundant waters to which are joined
underground conduits whence water is drawn through orifices
as in wells. At these men renew their supplies of water, for
there is little of it upon the way on account of the continuous
drought. May God send rains in plenty to His country and
His servants. At this place the caravan paused on the morning
of Monday to water the camels and to collect a supply of
water.
This assembly of 'Iraqis, together with the people from
Khurasan, Mosul, and other lands who were united in the
company of this Emir of the Pilgrimage, formed a multitude
whose number only God Most High could count. The vast
plain was teeming with them, and the far-extending desert
could barely contain them. You could see the earth shake
giddily because of them, and form waves through their great
number. You might behold them as a sea of swollen billows;
its waters the mirage, its ships the mounts, and its sails the
raised canopies and palanquins. Like piled up clouds they moved
along, commingling widi each odier, and brushing against each
other's sides. Upon the wide desert plain you would observe
such a throng as would fill you with fear and alarm, with the
collisions of the na6'a-wood [Chadara tenax] of the Utters beating
against each other. He who has not witnessed this journeying
of the 'Iraqis has not seen one of those wonders of time
that are discussed amongst men and that beguile listeners by
their strangeness. Power and strength belong to God alone.
It is enough to tell you that should one who has a station in
212 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
this encampment go forth on any need and leave no sign to
guide him back to his location, he will go astray and, exhausted,
wander crying out amongst the number of the lost. At times
the situation will compel such an one to repair to the pavilion
of the Emir and raise the matter to him. He will instruct one
of his heralds to give out a proclamation and direct one of the
public criers appointed for the purpose to take the man behind
him on his camel and tour with him that clamorous camp.
He will have given his name, and those of his camel-master
and of the land from whence he came, to the crier, who then
will raise his voice in notice of this lost one, calling out the
name of the camel-master and of his country until he comes
upon him and delivers the man to him. Were this not done,
he never again would meet his companion, unless he met him
unawares or came upon him in some chance encounter. This
is one of the amazing features of this caravan, whose marvels
are such that a description cannot comprehend them. Its members
possess such wealth and resources as will help them to all
they will need upon their way. Possessions are in the hand of
God, who grants them to whomsoever He wills.
Each year, if these ladies the princesses do not themselves
perform the pilgrimage, they despatch with trusted men some
water-bearing camels that quench the thirst of forlorn travellers
upon the pilgrim road. This they do in places where water is
known to be, throughout the road, on 'Arafat, and in the sacred
Mosque, each day and night. For this their reward in heaven
shall be great. From God alone assistance comes. Exalted is His
majesty. You will hear the crier with the water-camels announcing
with loud voice the free water, and those whose store has
been exhausted will hasten to him with their water-skins and
ewers that they might fill them. With all his breath the crier
will proclaim: 'God preserve the royal Khatun, daughter of
the king of such and such a state and consequence,' and extolling
him, and announcing her name and making known her
good deed, and bringing the people to offer prayers for her.
God will not fail to reward her good works. We have already
THE MONTH OF DHU L-HIJJAH (S79) 213
explained this expression 'Khatun' which with them does the
office of 'princess' or whatever is a fitting designation for a
royal lady.
Among the remarkable features of this caravan is that despite
its size and magnitude - for indeed it is a world of its own -
when, its baggage being unladen and camping site adopted,
the Emir's drum, which they call 'kus, is beaten as a signal
for departure, not a moment will pass between the saddling
and loading of the camels and their being mounted; and the
drummer will scarce have made his third beat when the beasts
will have taken their way.82 All this comes from the careful
preparations and diligent precautions taken by the travellers.
Power and strength belong to God alone. There is no God
but He.
By night they march by lighted torches held in the hands of
footmen, and you can see no Utter that is not led by one, so
that the people march between wandering stars that lighten
the darkness of the night, while the earth vies in splendour
with the stars of the sky. The appurtenances of industry, the
worldly conveniences, and the requisites of animal satisfaction,
all were present in this nothing-lacking caravan. Long it would
take to describe it, and its story cannot all be embraced.
After the midday prayers on Monday we took our way
from Khulays and marched until the late evening when we
halted to slumber a little. The drum then beat and we set forth
again, journeying forward until the sun had well risen, when
we alighted to rest until noon, it then being Tuesday. Leaving
our resting place, we trended to a valley called Wadi 1-Samk
[The Deep Valley], a name that does not conform to reality,
and there in the late evening encamped. We tarried there the
morning of Wednesday renewing our store of water, which
in this valley lies in pools, and is sometimes dug for in the
sand. We departed thence at midday on Wednesday, and at
night moved up a stony slope, difficult of ascent, where many
camels perished. We then came down to a plain, and slept there
till the middle of the night. Over a wide and deep-extending
N
214 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
waste, stretching as far as the eye could see and covered with
sand, we bent our way; and so broad and easy was the road
that the camels marched untied. On Thursday the 29th of Dhu
l-Hijjah, we dismounted for our midday rest two stages yet
away from Badr. No sooner had noon come than we marched
to a place near Badr where we descended to pass the night,
departing thence before midnight and coming to Badr when
the day had well risen.
Badr is a village of continuous palm-groves and has a fortress
on a high hill which is approached from the bed of a valley
lying between mountains. Badr has a spring with copious
waters, but the place of the ancient well beside which occurred
the Islamic battle which exalted the faith and abased the polytheists
is to-day all palms. Behind this he the martyrs who died
upon that day. The Mount of Compassion, on which the angels
descended, is on the left of him who, leaving Badr, enters into
(the valley of) al-Safra', and beside it is Jabal al-Tubul [Mount
of the Drums], which is like a large mound of sand. This name
comes from a legend to which most Muslims are attached.
They declare that every Friday the roll of drums is heard upon
that hill, as if it were the remaining trace of the signal of the
Prophet's victory in that place. God best knows concerning
these hidden things.
The place where once stood the arbour of the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him - touches the foot of this Mount
of the Drums, and the battlefield lies before it. Beside the palmgrove
at the ancient well is a mosque said to be the place where
the Prophet's - may God bless and preserve him - camel knelt.
We were assured, on the word of one of the Bedouin living in
Badr, that they hear the beat of the drums on the mountain,
but he specified every Monday and Thursday for its occurrence.
We marvelled greatly at his statement, and the truth of
it none but God Most High can know.
One post-stage lies between Badr and al-Safra', the road to
which lies in a valley between mountains with continuous palmgroves
and many springs; a beautiful road in truth. In al-Safra'
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (579) 215
is a lofty fortress and close at hand are many other forts, among
them two that are called respectively Hisn al-Tu'aman [Fort
of the Twins] and Hisn al-Hasaniyah [Hasan's Fort], and there
is a third called Hisn al-Jadid [The New Fort]. Many other
strongholds there are, as well as successive villages.
The Month of Muharram in the Year 580
[14th of April-i3th of May, 1184]
May God let us know its blessings, and the blessings of the year it opens,
favouring us during it with His mercy and guaranteeing us His protection
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Saturday
as we were leaving Badr for al-Safra', and we spent the
night below its crescent in this venerated ground of Badr where
God gave victory to the Muslims and vanquished the polytheists.
Praise be to God for that. We alighted at al-Safra' after
the last evening prayer, and there, until noon on Saturday the
1st of the month, we tarried that the people might renew their
provision of water and take some rest. From al-Safra' to the
venerated Medina is, within God's pleasure, three days'journey.
We left it at noon on Saturday, and prolonged our march until
the end of the last evening prayer. Our way had lain through
a valley running continuously through mountains. The night
of Sunday we rested until midnight when we again set forth
and travelled until the forenoon, alighting for our midday rest
at the well Dhat al-'Alam where it is said that 'Ali ibn Abi
Talib - may God hold him in His favour - fought with the jinn
[demons]. It is also known as al-Rawha', is fed by a spring,
and is exceeding deep, the bucket-cord scarce reaching to the
bottom. We left it after the midday prayers on Sunday and
prolonged our march until after the last evening prayer, when
we halted at Shi'b 'Ali [the Mountain Path of 'Ali] - may God
hold him in His favour. We removed thence at midnight to
Turban and then to al-Bayda', whence can be seen Medina
the venerated.
In the forenoon of Monday the 3rd of Muharram we
encamped in the valley of al-'Aqiq on whose side is the mosque
of Dhu '1-Hulayfah where the Apostle of God - may God bless
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 217
and preserve him-assumed the ihram [pilgrim garb]. Medina
is five miles from this place. At Dhu 'l-Hulayfah commences
the haram [sacred territory] of Medina (which extends) to the
tomb of Hamzah and to Quba'. The first thing that strikes
the eye is the tall white minaret of its mosque. We left Dhu
l-Hulayfah after the midday prayers on Monday the 16th of
April, and alighted outside Medina the Refulgent, the White
Mausoleum, the ground ennobled by Muhammad, Lord of the
Prophets - may God bless and preserve him throughout all
time.
On the evening of that day we made our entry into the
sacred Haram that we might visit the venerated and immaculate
Rawdah [Tomb]. We stood beside it in salutation and kissed
the earth on its sacred sides. We prayed in the Rawdah83 that
is between the sacred tomb and the pulpit, and kissed8* the
wooden supports of the old pulpit on which once stood the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and the rest of
the palm-tree trunk which leant towards him. - may God bless
and preserve him. This is attached to the pillar erected in front
of the little Rawdah between the tomb and the pulpit and to
your right if, standing in the Rawdah, you face the qiblah. We
then said the sunset prayers with the congregation.
By a happy chance we found a measure of room on this
occasion, for the people were engaged in pitching their tents
and arranging their baggage. We thus were able to achieve
our object. We had succeeded in corning to the much-praised
tomb, and in making our due salutes to the two Companions
there reclining, Al-Saddiq [The Faithful One] of Islam [Abu
Bakr], and Al-Faruq [The Distinguisher (of True from False),
'Umar], and then returned to our baggage, rejoicing and thanking
God for His favour towards us. There remained no hope
or purpose of our blessed journey that we had not satisfied,
no object we had not achieved, and our thoughts were freed
to think of return to our native land. May God unite us with
those we have left behind, and complete thereby His favour
towards us. Praise be to God for the benefits He has conferred
218 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and for the beneficent works that from the first and always
He has done. He it is to whom praise and thanks are due. There
is no God but He.
A description of the Mosque of the Apostle of God-may
God bless and preserve him-and of his sacred and
immaculate Rawdah
The blessed Mosque is oblong in shape, and is surrounded
on all four sides by porticoes. In its centre is a court covered
with sand and gravel. The south side has five rows of porticoes
running from west to east, and the north side also has five
porticoes in the same style. The east side has three porticoes
and the west four. The sacred Rawdah is at the eastern extremity
of the south side. It extends over two rows of porticoes on the
side of the court and projects about four spans into the third.
It has five angles and five sides, and its form is so wondrous
that one can barely portray or describe it. Four of its sides
incline away from the direction of the qiblah in an ingenious
fashion, and because of this deviation from the qiblah, no one
is able to face them in his prayers. The sheik, the imam, learned
and pious, last of the learned doctors, and pillar of jurisprudents,
Abu Ibrahim Ishaq ibn Ibrahim the Tunisian - may God hold
him in His favour-told us that 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Azizmay
God hold him in His favour - determined this in planning
the construction from a fear that men might take them as a
place of prayer. From the east side, the Rawdah also covers
two rows of porticos, and thus encloses six portico columns.
The length of the side facing the qiblah is twenty-four spans,85
that of the east thirty, that between die east and north corners
thirty-five, that from the north corner to the west thirty-nine,
and that from the west corner to the south twenty-four. On
this side is an ebony chest inlaid with sandal-wood, faced with
silver and embellished with stars. It is opposite the head of the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and is five spans
long, three wide and four high.86 On the side between the
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 219
north and the west corners is a place over which hangs a curtain
that is said to be where the angel Gabriel came down.
Upon him be (eternal) happiness.
The circumference of the venerated Rawdah is two hundred
and seventy-two spans. It is covered with finely cut marble of
splendid quality. The wainscot rises to a third (of its height)
or a little less. Above this another third of the blessed walls
is daubed with an unguent of musk and other perfumes to a
depth of half a span, and blackened, cracked, and accumulated
by the passage of time. The walls above this are composed of
wooden lattice-work that reaches to the ceiling, for the top
of the blessed Rawdah touches the ceiling of the Mosque. The
veils (that covers the Rawdah) fall as far as the line of the
marble wainscot. They are of azure colour with a check of
white quadrangular and octangular figures containing roundels
and encircled by white dots. They present a handsome spectacle
of novel design. In the upper part runs a band tending to
white. In the south wall, opposite the venerated face of the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve him-is a silver nail
before which men stand to give their salutations. At his feet -
may God bless and preserve him - lies the head of Abu Bakr
The Faithful - may God hold him in His favour - and the head
of 'Umar The Distinguisher (of True from False) is nigh to
the shoulders of Abu Bakr The Faithful - may God hold them
both in His favour. He who makes his salutation turns his back
to the qiblah and, looking towards the venerated face, gives
his salute. He then turns right towards the face of Abu Bakr,
and then towards that of 'Umar - may God hold them both
in His favour.
Before this venerated wall hang about twenty silver lamps,
and amongst them are two of gold. At the north of the sacred
Rawdah is a marbled trough having at its southern end a kind
of mihrab. It is said that it is the house of Fatimah - may God
hold her in His favour - and also reputed to be her grave. God
best knows the truth of this. To the right of the venerated
Rawdah the noble pulpit stands forty-two paces away from it.
22o THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
It is set in the blessed haud which is fourteen paces long, six
wide, and a span and a half high, and wholly clothed in
marble. Between it and the small Rawdah that lies between
the venerated tomb and the pulpit, and which tradition declares
to be one of the Rawdahs [gardens] of Paradise, lie eight paces.
Into this Rawdah men throng to pray, as indeed it is meet
and proper that they should. Beside it, to the south, is a pillar
said to enclose a relic of the palm-tree trunk that leant towards
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. A piece of it
can be seen in the pillar and men kiss it and hasten to acquire
blessings by touching it and passing their cheeks over it. At
the south end of this small Rawdah is the chest (described
above).
The venerated pulpit is a man's stature or more in height,
five spans wide, five paces long, and has eight steps. The door
is in the form of a grille four and a half spans long. It is locked,
but is opened every Friday. The pulpit is covered with ebonywood,
and the seat of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - can be seen above, covered by an ebony board that
does not touch it, but protects it from being sat upon. Men
insert their hands beneath it and smooth the venerated seat to
acquire blessings by touching it. At the top of the right support
of the pulpit, where the preacher puts his hand when
delivering the khutbah, is a hollow silver ring, resembling that
which the tailor puts on his finger, but only so in shape and
not in size, for this is larger and loose and encircles the support.
Men say that it was the plaything of al-Hasan and al-Husayn -
may God hold them in His favour-when their grandfather
[Muhammad] - may God bless and preserve him - delivered
the khutbah.
The venerated Mosque is one hundred and ninety-six paces
long and one hundred and twenty-six wide. It has two hundred
and ninety columns that are like straight props, for they
reach the ceiling and have no arches bending over them. They
are composed of stone hewn into a number of round, bored
blocks, mortised together and with melted lead poured between
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 22I
each pair so that they form a straight column. They are then.
covered with a coat of plaster, and rubbed and polished zealously
until they appear as white marble. The portico to the south,
which we have mentioned as having five rows of porticoes,
is enfolded by a maqsurah that flanks its length from west to
east and in which there is a mihrab. The imam prays in the
aforementioned little Rawdah beside the chest. Between this
maqsurah and the Rawdah and the sacred tomb is a big painted
reading-desk on which lies a large Koran locked in a case. It is
one of the four copies [see note 120] sent by 'Uthman ibn
'Affan-may God hold him in His favour-to the several
cities.
Beside the maqsurah, to the east, are two large cupboards
containing books and Korans endowed as a waqf to the blessed
Mosque. Hard by these cupboards, in the second (row of) porticoes
and also to the east, is a trap-door fitted to the level of
the ground and locked. It covers a subterranean passage, to
which one descends by steps, that leads out from the Mosque
to the house of Abu Bakr the Faithful - may God hold him
in His favour. This is the way that 'A'ishah was wont to use.
Fast by this house is that of 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, as well as
that of his son 'Abdullah - may God hold them both in His
favour. Beyond a peradventure this place is the passage leading
to Abu Bakr's house which the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - especially commanded should be preserved.
In front of the sacred Rawdah is another large chest that holds
the candles and chandeliers which every night are lit before it.
Towards the east is a wooden structure where some of the
guardians of the blessed Mosque sleep. These guardians are
Abyssinian eunuchs and slaves of handsome presence, elegantly
clad and ornamented. The resident muezzin of the Mosque
is a descendant of Bilal - may God hold him in His favour. In
the north part of the court is a large pavilion, newly-built,
called Qubbat al-Zayt [The Pavilion of the Oil], that acts as
a store for all the appointments of the blessed Mosque and contains
all that is needful for it. Beside it in the court are fifteen
222 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
palm-trees. In the upper part of the mihrab that is in the south
wall, inside the maqsurah, is a square yellow stone, one span
square and of a bright and shining surface, that is said to be the
mirror of Chosroes. God best knows. Above this in the mihrab
there is a nail driven into the wall, and on it is a kind of small
casket of which no one knows the origin but which men say
may be the drinking-cup of Chosroes. God best knows the
truth of all this.
The lower half of the south wall is cased with marble, tile
on tile, of varying order and colour: a splendid marquetry. The
upper half is wholly inlaid with pieces of gold called fusayjlsa
[Gr., yrnpos] in which the artist has displayed amazing skill,
producing shapes of trees in divers forms, their branches laden
with fruits. The whole Mosque is of this style, but the work
in the south wall is more embellished. The wall looking on
the court from the south side is of this manner, as also is that
which does so from the north side. The west and east walls
that overlook the court are wholly white and carved, and
adorned with a band that contains various kinds of colours.
It would take too long to portray and describe the decorations
of this blessed Mosque that contains the sacred and unspotted
tomb whose charge is more noble and whose resting-place is
more exalted than all that adorns it.
The blessed Mosque has nineteen gates of which only four
are open. On the west there are two, one called Bab al-Rahmah
[Gate of Pity], and the other Bab al-Khashyah [Gate of Fear].
On the east there are also two, one called Bab Jibril [Gate of
Gabriel] - upon whom be eternal happiness - and the other
Bab al-Rakha' [Gate of Plenty]. Facing Bab Jibril-upon whom
be eternal happiness - is the house of'Uthruan - may God hold
him. in His favour-in which he was martyred. Facing the
venerated Rawdah on this eastern side is the tomb of Jamal
al-Din of Mosul - may God have mercy on his soul - whose
story and the monuments of whose generosity are celebrated,
and whose memorable deeds we have already recorded. In front
of the venerated Rawdah is (a window with) an iron grating
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 223
opening on the Rawdah from which exudes a perfumed aroma.
To the south there is a small locked gate; to the north there
are four locked gates; to the west another five, also locked;
and to the east yet five more locked, which with the four open
gates gives a total of nineteen gates. The blessed Mosque has
three minarets, one in the angle between the east and the south,
and the other two in the two north corners. They are small
and have the form of turrets but the first is like a minaret.
A note on the venerated tombs in Baki' al-Gharqad*7 and
on the slopes of Jahal Uhud
The first of these we shall mention is the mosque of Hamzah -
may God hold him in His favour. It is to the south of Mount
Uhud, which stands three miles north of Medina. Over the
tomb of Hamzah - may God hold him in His favour - has been
built a mosque, and the tomb lies in a court north of it with
the martyrs - may God hold them in His favour - beside him.
The cave in which the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - lived is alongside the martyrs at the foot of the mountain.
Around the martyrs is a red sepulchre which is the
one ascribed to Hamzah, and here men come to acquire
blessings.
The cemetery of al-Gharquad lies to the east of Medina, and
men go forth to it by the gate called Bab al-Baqi*. The first
thing you meet on leaving this gate, on your left, is the tomb of
Safiyyah, aunt of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve
him - and mother of al-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam - may God
hold him in His favour. In front of this tomb is that of Malik
ibn Anas, the Madinite iman-may God hold him in His
favour. Over this is a small cupola, modestly built. In front of
this is the tomb of the immaculate scion, Ibrahim, son of the
Prophet-may God bless and preserve him - surmounted by
a white cupola. To .the right of this is the tomb of a son of
'Umar ibn al-Khattab - may God hold him in His favour -
called 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awsat and commonly known as
224 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
Abu Shahmah. He it was who was scourged by his father in
exactment of a divine penalty and fell sick therefrom and died.
May God hold them both in His favour. Close by it is the
tomb of'Aqil ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour
- and of 'Abdullah ibn Ja'far al-Tayyar - may God hold him
in His favour. Alongside them is a rawdah in which he the
wives of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - and
nigh to this is a small rawdah holding three sons of the Prophet
- may God bless and preserve him. Bordering this is the rawdah
of al-'Abbas ibn ' Abd al-Muttalib and al-Hasan ibn ' Ali - may
God hold them in His favour - which consists of a dome rising
into the air. It is near the Bab al-Baqi' mentioned above, and
to the right of him who leaves by it. The head of al-Hasan
is towards the feet of al-'Abbas - may God hold them in His
favour-and both their tombs rise prominently from the
ground. They are covered by admirably joined panels inlaid
with brass plates and decorated with stars formed from nails
in a remarkable fashion that is most beautiful to regard. After
this style is the tomb of Ibrahim, son of the Prophet - may
God bless and preserve him.
Fast by this dome of al-'Abbas is the house named after
Fatimah, daughter of the Apostle - may God bless and preserve
him. It is known as the House of Sorrow, and is said to
be the house to which she withdrew and kept within while
grieving for the death of her father the Chosen One - may
God bless and preserve him. At the end of the cemetery is
the tomb of the ill-used martyr 'Uthman, possessor of the Two
Lights88 - may God hold him in His favour - and over this is
a small and simple cupola. Near to this is the shrine of Fatimah,
daughter of Asad and mother of 'Ah - may God hold her and
her sons in favour. The tombs in this cemetery are more than
can be counted, for it is the burial place of the greater part of
the Companions, Fugitives and Helpers80 - may God hold them
all in His favour. On the tomb of Fatimah is written: 'No tomb
holds such an one as Fatimah, daughter of Asad' - may God
hold her and her sons in favour.
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 225
Quba' lies about two miles to the south of Medina. It was
once a large city contiguous with Medina, the venerated. The
road to it goes through continuous palm-groves. Medina itself
is surrounded by palms, which are most plentiful on the south
and east sides, and less so on the west. The mosque founded in
Quba' from sentiments of piety has been restored. It is squareshaped
with straight sides and has a tall white minaret that can
be seen from afar. In its midst is the 'Place of Kneeling of the
She-Dromedary', that of the Prophet - may God bless and
preserve him - which is surrounded by a low enclosure forming
a kind of small rawdah in which men pray to acquire blessings.
In the south part of the court, on a stone bench, is a species
of mihrab that is the place where the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - performed his first rak'ah. To the south of
this are other mihrabs. The mosque has one door only, at the
west, and has seven rows of porticoes through its length and
the same number breadthways. South of the mosque is a hut
belonging to the Banu '1-Najjar that was the dwelling of Abu
Ayyub the Ansarite. In an open space west of the mosque is
a well beside whose brink stands a broad stone in the form of
a trough at which men do their ritual ablutions. Adjacent to
the hut of the Banu '1-Najjar is that of 'A'ishah - may God
hold her in His favour - and contiguous with that is those of
'Umar, Fatimah, and Abu Bakr - may God hold them in His
favour. Beside them is the well of 'Axis into which the Prophet
- may God bless and preserve him - spat, so that from being
brackish its waters became sweet. It was into this well that the
Prophet's ring - may God bless and preserve him - fell from
the hand of 'Uthman, and the tradition concerning it is well
known.90 At the end of the village is a tall hill called 'Arafat
by which one passed to Dar al-Suffah [the House of the Choice
Ones, see note 124] where stayed 'Ammar and Salman with
their companions called Ahl al-Suffah [The Choice Ones]. This
hill is called 'Arafat because the Prophet - may God bless and
preserve him - stood upon it on the Day of 'Arafah and, the
land contracting for him, he gazed upon the people on Mount
226 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
'Arafat (at Mecca). The antiquities and. shrines of this venerated
town are numerous beyond computation.
Medina the Venerated is double-walled, with four gates,
each gate facing another in the opposite wall. One of the
gates is all iron, whence it is called Bab al-Hadid. Next to it
is the Bab al-Shari'ah [Watering Gate], then Bab al-Qiblah
which is locked, then Bab al-Baqi' already mentioned. Before
you come to the walls of Medina, a bow-shot to the west,
you come upon the famous ditch that the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve him-made when the Confederates91 [al-
Ahzab] mustered against him. Between it and Medina, on
the right of the road, is the spring named after the Prophet -
may God. bless and preserve him-round which is a large
oblong enclosure. The source of the well is in the middle of
this enclosure, which forms a sort of oblong basin. Below it
are two oblong troughs the length of the basin, and between
each trough and the basin a wall has been built so that the basin
is itself enclosed by two walls. The basin supplies the water
to the troughs, to which descent is made by means of twentyfive
steps. The water of this blessed spring is enough for all
the people of the earth and not only the inhabitants of Medina.
Men use it for their ablutions, for drinking, and for washing
their garments; but the water in the basin is not taken save
for drinking that it might be kept pure and preserved. Near
to it, in the direction of Medina, is the Dome of the Rock of
Oil, of which it is said that oil oozed forth from it for the
Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. North of this is
the well of Buda'ah, beside which, to the left, is Satan's Mount
where, on the day of 'Uhud, he - God curse him - cried out
saying, 'Your prophet has been slain.'
On the brink of the ditch that we have mentioned is a
stronghold called Hisn al-Uzzab [the Castle of the Celibates],
and now in ruins. It is said that 'Umar - may God hold him
in His favour - built it for the celibates of Medina. Before
it, at a distance to the west, is the well of Rumah of which
'Uthman-may God hold him in His favour - bought the
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 227
half for twenty thousand (dirhams). On the road to Uhud
is the mosque of 'Ah - may God hold him in His favour -
and those of Salman - may God hold him in His favour - and
of al-Fath [Victory] where the surah of the Fath [The Chapter
of 'The Victory', Koran XLVIII] was revealed to the Prophet
-may God bless and preserve him. Medina the blessed has a
third fountain of spring water,92 inside the Bab al-Hadid, to
which one descends by steps and which is near the venerated
Haram. South of this Haram is the house of the Imam of the
Dar al-Hijrah [Home of the Flight=Medina], Malik ibn Anas
- may God hold him in His favour. Round the whole of the
Haram runs a road paved with cut stones.
Such is the brief and unstudied account of the monuments
and shrines of Medina the Venerated that the dictates of speed
have allowed us to recount. God is the Master of success.
Among the strange affairs that are discussed and listened to
by men we witnessed the following. One of the aforementioned
khatuns, the daughter of the Emir Mas'ud, whom with her
father we have already described, came to the Mosque of the
Apostle of God - may God bless and preserve him - on the
evening of Thursday the 6th of Muharram, the fourth day
after our arrival at Medina, riding in her litter, surrounded by
the htters of her ladies and handmaidens and led by Koranreaders,
while pages and eunuch-slaves, bearing iron rods,
moved around her driving the people from her path until she
arrived at the venerated Mosque. Wrapped in an ample cloak,
she descended and advanced to salute the Prophet - may God
bless and preserve him - her servants going before her and the
officials of the Mosque raising their voices in prayer for her
and extolling her fame. She came to the small rawdah between
the venerated tomb and the pulpit, and prayed there wrapped
in her cloak while the people who thronged around her were
kept back by the rods. She then prayed in the hand beside the
manbar, and moving thence to the west wall of the venerated
rawdah, sat in the place where it is said that the Angel Gabriel
- upon whom be eternal happiness - came down. The curtain
228 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
was then lowered on her, and her pages, slaves, and chamberlains
remained without the curtain receiving her commands.
She had brought with her to the mosque two loads of provisions
as alms for the poor, and stayed in her place until night had
fallen.
The announcement then was made of the arrival of Sadr
al-Din of Isbahan, chief of the Shafi'ites, who from successive
ancestors has inherited renown and regard. He had come to
conduct an exhortatory meeting that night, which was the
night of Friday the 7th of Muharram, and arrived late, when
part of the night had passed and the Haram was filled with
people, including the Khatun sitting in her place, awaiting him.
The cause of his delay had been the lateness of the Emir of
the Pilgrimage, for he himself had been ready to come. At
last he arrived and the Emir came too. A throne had been prepared
beside the sacred rawdah for this Chief of the 'Ulama
[doctors of law and divinity], who is known by this title
inherited from father to son, and he ascended it. The Koranreaders
took post before him and began93 to intone with sweet
melody and moving and affecting modulation, the while he
gazed upon the sacred tomb and wept openly. He then launched
upon a khutbah of his own composition that was of bewitching
eloquence, and pursued the several paths of homily in the
two languages [Arabic and Persian]. He then recited some
pleasing verses of his own, among which was the following
that, pointing to the rawdah, he repeated at each mention of
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him:
'This is his rawdah, a zephyr diffusing.
Pray for him now, and send him your greeting.'
He then begged forbearance for his shortcomings in that august
place, and exclaimed: 'Ah strange conceit for an ill-speaking
foreigner. How dare he speak before the most eloquent of the
Arabs? [Muhammad].'
He continued his exhortation until men's spirits were carried
away in contrition and emotion. The Persians flung themselves
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 229
upon him, declaring their repentance, their hearts enravished,
and their minds enraptured. They presented their forelocks to
him, and, sending for a pair of scissors, he cut them one by
one. He would place his turban on the head of one whose
forelock had been cut, and straightway another turban would
be put on his head, by one of his readers or companions who,
knowing his generous habit, hastened to offer their own that
they might acquire good repute for their manifest liberality.
He continued to remove one turban after another from his
head until he had removed a large number and cut many forelocks.
He then closed his meeting and said: 'My good friends
here assembled, I have spoken to you in the Haram of Great
and Glorious God, and to-night I speak to you in the Haram
of His Apostle - may God bless and preserve him. A preacher
must indulge in some mendicity, and I ask of you a thing I
need which, if you grant it me, I shall not blush to tell you of.'
All announced their readiness to help, while their sobs rose
high. 'My need,' he said, 'is that you bear your heads and
stretch forth your arms and beseech this noble Prophet to hold
me in his favour and to seek for me the favour of Great and
Glorious God'; and then began to enumerate and confess his
sins. The people threw off their turbans and stretched forth
their arms to the (tomb of) the Prophet - may God bless and
preserve him - praying for this man, weeping and imploring.
I never saw a night of more tears and contrition than this.
When he left the Emir left too, and the Khatun departed from
her place. Upon the arrival of Sadr al-Din, the curtain had
been raised from her and, wrapped in her cloak, she had
remained between her ladies and her servants, while we who
regarded her marvelled at her regal mien.
This man Sadr al-Din is remarkable in his nobility, splendour,
and majesty, in the magnificence of his circumstance,
the elegance of his state, his outward power, his plentiful furnitures,
his many slaves and servants, and in the number of his
retinue and following, so that kings fall short of his dignity. His
pavilion rises into the air like a great crown; it is set with doors
o
230 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
fashioned in singular style, and. is of remarkable shape and
design. From afar you may see it dominating the encampment
as it aspires to the skies. The state of this exalted personage is
indeed such that a description cannot comprehend it. We
attended an audience of his, and observed a man of bright and
cheerful countenance who, notwithstanding his great dignity
and imposing presence, at once, by his kindness and goodness,
put at ease those who had come to visit him. He was preeminent
both in knowledge and in person. We begged of him,
and he granted us, some lines of prose and poetry. He is the
greatest of those we have seen in these lands.
On Friday the 7th of Muharram we witnessed such an
heretical innovation that Islam should cry out against it (the
war-cry), 'O Allah. O Muslims.' It consisted in this. The
khatib arrived to deliver the allocution, and ascended the pulpit
of the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him. This person,
as it was related, followed a path of which men disapproved,
unlike the Persian sheik and imam who functioned at the
obligatory prayers in the venerated Mosque and whose way
was virtuous and godly as befitted the imam of such a noble
place. When the muezzins had finished the call to prayers, this
preacher rose to deliver the khutbah. The two black banners
had been brought in before him and set on either side of the
venerated pulpit, and these he stood between. When he had
finished the first part of the khutbah he sat for a pause that
was contrary to the usual break in the khutbah, which is proverbial
for its brevity, and an insolent group of Mosque officials
then pressed forward, breaking through the ranks of the worshippers
and trampling on their necks, to beg of the Persians
and of those others present on behalf of this unworthy preacher.
Some threw off their precious robes,-others brought out the
costly piece of silk that they had prepared for this purpose and
presented it; others took off their turbans and flung them in;
and some there were who stripped off their mantles and gave
them. Those whose means did not extend to this gave a piece
of coarse calico. Some threw in gold parings, and some put
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 231
forth their hands with one or two dinars, and others gave their
moiety. Women cast off their silver anklets, or removed their
rings, offering these and other things that would take long to
describe. Throughout all this the khatib remained sitting in the
pulpit, throwing on those who so sedulously laboured for him
among the people looks of avarice and greed that he constantly
repeated in his avidity for more. The time for prayers had
almost passed, and men of piety and truth were clamouring
and openly crying out (their protests), while the khatib, who
had no blush of shame upon his face, sat waiting for the drinking
up of the last drop of the alms. From this unlawful trade,
there was collected before him a large pile, and when he was
satisfied he rose and completed the khutbah, and then prayed
with the people. Enlightened men left weeping for religion,
despairing of the happiness of the world, and assured of the
portents of the Day of Judgement. To God belongs the future
and the past.
On the evening of that blessed day we bade farewell to the
blessed rawdah and holy tomb. Ah what an uncommon parting,
perturbing the mind in dismay until it is unsettled, and so
commoting the soul from its pangs that it dissolves into fragments.
What think you of a site where one must whisper farewell
to the Lord [Muhammad] of those that were and those
that are to come, the Seal of Prophets, and the Apostle of the
Lord of the Universe. In truth it is a place which makes men's
hearts to break and sends the heaviest and most sluggish minds
to ecstasy. O sorrow, sorrow! Each one reveals his yearning
(for the place), and finds no means to leave it or any way to
resignation. In the awful grandeur of that sight nothing could
be heard save wails and lamentations, and all with the voice
of the moment seemed to recite:
'My love demands that I should stay,
But fortune send me on my way.'
May God dispose unto us, through this visit to the noble
Prophet^ an honoured dwelling in Heaven, making him our
232 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
intercessor on the Day ofjudgement and, by His favour, bringing
us beside him in the eternal abode. This by His mercy, for
He is the Forgiving, the Compassionate, the Bountiful, the
Generous.
We had stayed in Medina the venerated five days, the first
being a Monday and the last a Friday, and in the forenoon of
Saturday the 8th of Muharram, being the 21st of April, we
departed for 'Iraq. May God bring us to our aim, and ease for
us our way. At Medina we had furnished ourselves with water
for three days, and on the third day of our journey, a Monday,
we encamped at Wadi 'l-'Arus. Here men provide themselves
with water, digging for it into the ground to a well of sweet
spring-water, from which the innumerable persons of this caravan,
and the still greater number of camels, quenched their
thirst. Power belongs to God. Glory to Him.
From Wadi l-'Arus we climbed to the land of Nejd, leaving
behind us the Tihamah, and travelling across a level tract of
land whose nearer parts the eyes fall short of and whose extremities
they cannot reach. We inhaled the breezes of Nejd and the
air that has passed into proverb, and our minds and bodies were
refreshed by the coolness of those breezes and the salubrity of
that air. On Tuesday the fourth day of our journey, we alighted
near a watering place called al-'Usaylah, and on Wednesday,
the fifth day, we halted at a place called Nuqrah which has
wells and tanks like vast cisterns. One of these we found full
of rainwater, and it was enough for the whole caravan,
showing no mminishment despite the amount of water
drawn. This Emir's mode of travel with the pilgrims was
to march from midnight to the early part of the forenoon,
to rest until midday, and then move forward till the
late evening, resuming the march at midnight. Such was his
usage.
The night of Thursday the 13 th of Muharram, being the
sixth day on this journey, we stopped at a water-point called
al-Qarurah which has tanks filled with rainwater. This place
is in the centre of the land of Nejd. In no inhabited country
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 233
have I ever come upon a land more wide-extending or bountiful,
of more scented breezes and more healthful air, or more
even-ranging, with clearer skies, more weed-less earth, greater
invigoration for the spirit and the body, and more temperate
weather at all times, than the land of Nejd. But long it would
take to describe its merits, and our talk would cause us to
digress too far.
On the morning of this Thursday we came to al-Hajir where
the water is kept in tanks, although often they dig for it in
shallow pits which they call ahfar, or in the singular, hafar.
We had feared a dearth of water on this road, especially because
of the great multitude of men and camels, which, if the sea
were brought to it, it would dry up and exhaust. But from
the clouds God in His mercy sent down that which changed
this low-lying plain into a lake, caused the torrents to gush in
their courses, and filled the valleys with the rains of spring.
And so in rapid stream we saw the waters flowing across the
surface of the ground; all by the grace and favour of God, and
from His goodness and mercy to His servants. Praise be to
Him for that.
On the same day, at al-Hajir, we crossed two streams in
torrent; the pools and swamps (we crossed) were numberless.
The next day, Friday, we alighted in the early morning at
Samirah, an inhabited place in whose plain is a kind of fort
surrounded by a large enceinte and dwelt in. It has water in
many wells, that are however brackish, as well as in swamps
and pools. Here the Bedouin barter their products, which are
meat, butter, and milk; and the pilgrims, greedy for meat and
thirsty for milk, rush to buy it, giving pieces of coarse calico
that they bring with them for dealing with the Bedouin, who
will not barter save for this.
Early on the morning of Saturday we halted at Jabal al-
Makhruq [The Hill of the Hole], which is a hill lying in a stretch
of desert and having on its upper sides a tunnel through which
the wind passes. We moved on from this place, and spent part
of the night in Wadi 1-Kurush where there is no water. We
234 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
left it during the night, and on the morning of Sunday came
to Fayd.
Fayd is a large fortress with turrets and merlons lying in a
level tract of land. Around it stretches a suburb enclosed by
a wall of ancient construction. It is inhabited by Bedouin who
support themselves by trading and bartering, and doing other
useful things with the pilgrims. It is here that the pilgrims leave
a part of their provisions (when on their way to Mecca), as
a precaution against their running out of them on their return,
and in the place they have an acquaintance with whom they
leave them. Fayd is halfway, or a little less, from Baghdad to
Mecca by way of Medina - may God exalt it. Al-Kufah is
twelve days' journey from it by a good and level road furnished,
praise be to God, with many tanks.
The Emir of the Pilgrimage entered this place in battle array
and under arms, to drive fear into the Bedouin there assembled
that they might not be moved by covetousness against the pilgrims.
They threw rapacious looks on the pilgrim encampment,
but saw no way to approach it. Praise be to God. The
water here is plenteous in the wells, which are supplied from
underground springs. Among them the pilgrims found one
tank in which rainwater had been collected, and it was at once
exhausted. From their longing for meat, the hands of the pilgrims
were soon filled with sheep they had bartered from the
Bedouin, and there was no pavilion, nor tent, nor place of
shade but had beside it a ram. or two, according to means and
wealth. The whole encampment was filled with the sheep of
the Bedouin, and the day became a festival. In the same way
the Bedouin brought in their camels for those camel-masters
and others who wished to buy them for use upon the road.
As for butter, honey, and milk, there was none who did not
load some or take some for their use according to their needs.
All that day, and until noon of the Monday that followed it,
the people stayed resting in this place.
We left at midnight, observing the mode of marching we
have described, and in the early morning of Tuesday the 18th
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 235
of Muharram, which was the 1st of May, we halted at a place
called al-Ajfur [The Wells] that is celebrated amongst the
inhabitants as being the place of (the two lovers) Jamil and
Buthaynah of the tribe of 'Udhr. On this Tuesday, we set
forward, according to our custom, at noon, and in the late
evening encamped in the desert. We moved from it in the
night, and after the sun had risen on Wednesday, we alighted
at Zarud, which is a depression in a stretch of land covered
with sand. It has a large enceinte containing small houses,
and resembles a stronghold, being called in these parts,
al-Qasr [The Castle]. The water here comes from brackish
wells.
In the forenoon of Thursday the 20th of Muharram, which
was the 3rd of May, we put down at a place called al-Tha
'labiyah, where there is a ruined construction like a castle of
which nothing remains but the enceinte. Beside it is a vast tank
of great circumference, being one of the largest and deepest
cisterns that exist. Descent is made to it on three sides by many
steps, and in it was rainwater enough for all the caravan. To
this place came a numerous throng of Bedouin, men and
women, who made of it a great and teeming market for camels,
rams, butter, milk, and camel fodder. It was a day of brisk
commerce. From this point to al-Kufah, there are but three
stations that can furnish enough water for the whole caravan:
one is Zubalah, another Waqisah, and the third a place that
supplies water from the Euphrates and is near to al-Kufah
* * * *. Between these watering points there is water, but not
enough, whereas at them there is enough for all the men and
camels to draw upon at will. In this watering-place of al-Tha
'labiyah we witnessed a terrifying contention among the people
for the water, the like of which has hardly been seen in the
struggles for the mastery of cities and fortresses. Enough to
tell you that in that place died seven men, crushed by the
terrible press and trodden under water by the feet. They
hastened to drink water, and succeeded in drinking death. May
God pity and pardon them.
236 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
On the morning of Friday, we came to a place called Birkat
al-Marjum [The Pool of the Stoned One], that is a tank to
which water is brought from afar by means of an aqueduct
built for it high above the ground and constructed with an
excellence that argues great wealth and resources. This person
who was stoned to death has a grave on the side of the road
that has risen up like a tall hill, for all who pass along must
needs throw a stone upon it. Men relate that a king decreed
his lapidation for some affair which called for such. God best
knows. In this place are many tents belonging to the Bedouin,
who at once brought forth what foodstuffs they had to sell
them to the pilgrims. The tank was filled with rain and all
were able to drink deeply. Praise be to God.
These tanks, pools, wells, and stations on the road from
Baghdad to Mecca are monuments to Zubaydah, daughter of
Ja'far ibn Abi Ja'far al-Mansur and wife and cousin of (the
Caliph) Harun al-Rashid, who applied herself to this throughout
her life, leaving on this road facilities and useful works
which, from her death until to-day, have been of service to
all who every year go on an embassy [pilgrimage] to God
Most High.94 But for her generous acts in this direction this
road could not have been traversed. God in His satisfaction
will ensure her reward.
On the morning of Saturday, we halted at a place called
al-Shuquq, which has two tanks that we found filled with
sweet and limpid water. The pilgrims poured out the water
that they had and took of this good water, rejoicing at its
abundance and renewing their thanks to God. One of these
tanks is a huge cistern of great circumference that a swimmer
could not cross save with much effort and toil. The water in
it was more than two men's statures deep, and the people took
joy in swimming and bathing in it, and washing their garments.
It was for them a day of rest upon the journey, a gift
bestowed by God Most High to those on an embassy to Him,
visitors to His Haram. All these tanks were without water at the
time the pilgrims moved from Baghdad to Mecca, but God
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 237
in His mercy sent the clouds to fill them with water in readiness
for the coming of the pilgrims. All this from His favour
and kindness to the ambassadors [pilgrims] devoted to His
service.
We left that place in the evening and spent the night in
another called al-Tananir [The Ovens], which also had a tank
filled with water. We departed thence on the night of Sunday
the 23rd of Muharram, and with the dawn passed by Zubalah,
an inhabited village with a tall Bedouin fort and two tanks
and wells, being one of the (three) famous watering points on
the road. When the sun had well risen on that day we alighted
at al-Haythamayn where there are two tanks. Indeed, with
God's help, we hardly passed a place in which we did not
find water. Thanks be to Him for that.
We passed the night of Monday the 24th of Muharram near
a well-filled tank, and the caravan took its fill of water by
night. This place as at the foot of the acclivity called 'Aqabat
al-Shaytan [Satan's Slope]. With the morning, on Monday,
we climbed this slope, which is neither long nor difficult, for
the road is without unevenness and is famous on that account;
and when the sun was high we halted at an empty tank. We
had passed many tanks, and there was not one that had not
beside it a Bedouin-built castle. The road is all tanks. May
God hold in favour she who bestowed such care on the road
of God's embassy.
On the morning of Tuesday we dismounted at Waqisah,
which is a wide depression of land with well-filled tanks and
a large fort beside which are the ruins of a building. It is
inhabited by Bedouin and is the last watering place on the
road, there being between it and al-Kufah no watering place
of note save the water-courses from the Euphrates. It is three
days'journey from al-Kufah, many of whose inhabitants come
to meet the pilgrims at Waqisah, bringing with them flour,
bread, dates, condiments, and fruits of the season; and the pilgrims
felicitate each other on their deliverance. Praise be to
Great and Glorious God for the help and succour He has
238 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
bestowed: praise drawing more bounty, and accompanying
His accustomed beneficent works.
We spent the night of Wednesday the 26th in a place called
Lawzah, where there is a large tank which the people found
full and where they quenched again their thirsts and let the
camels drink at will. We marched from it by night and at
dawn on Wednesday we passed a place called al-Qar'a', where
there are the ruins of buildings. Here also is a tank divided
into six compartments that are small cisterns supplying water
to the fountains where the people drink. These are so many
that volumes could hardly contain and record them. Praise be
to God for His goodness and abounding grace.
The night of Thursday we rested at a huge tank full of
water, and on the morrow of that day we alighted at a minaret
called Manarat al-Qurun [The Minaret of the Horns]. This is
a tower rising in a stretch of desert with no buildings around
it. It rises from the ground like a column turned by a lathe,
and is made of baked bricks between which are inserted octangular
and quadrangular panels of terra-cotta ingeniously fashioned.
A singular feature of this tower is that it is decorated all over
with gazelle horns so set that it appears as the back of a hedgehog.
Concerning it men have a legend which, through lack
of adequate support, cannot be confirmed.
Near this minaret is a fort with tall towers, and beside this
is a great tank which we found filled with water. Praise be
to God for what He has bestowed. In the evening of this Thursday
we passed al-'Udhayb, which is a fruitful valley that has
a building and is surrounded by a fertile plain over which the
eye may roam and find relief. We were told that near it (runs
the) Bariq. From here we came to al-Ruhbah, (a village) near
to (that river) with habitations and cultivations through which
runs the water that issues from a spring in the upper part of
the village. We encamped a parasang in front of it.
At midnight on Friday the 28th of Muharram we bent our
way again and passed al-Qadisiyah, a considerable village with
palm-groves, and having water-courses from the Euphrates. In
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 239
the morning we came to al-Najaf [The Sand-Hill], which
stands behind al-Kufah as a kind of boundary between that
city and the desert. It is a wide stretch of hard ground over
which the eye can roam and find a fullness of satisfaction and
heart's content. We arrived at al-Kufah at sunrise on Friday.
Praise be to God for the safety He has given us.
A note on the city of al-Kufah
May God Most High protect it
Al-Kufah is a large city of ancient construction. Ruin has
secured mastery over the greater part of it, and the deserted
is more than the inhabited. One reason for its desolation is the
neighbouring tribe of Khafajah that does not cease to do it
injury (by raids). But the passage of days and nights is enough
to bring to life and to destroy. The buildings of this city are
made of bricks entirely, and it is without a wall. At the eastern
end stands the ancient mosque, with which no buildings are
contiguous east of it. It is an immense mosque with five porticoes
on its south side and two on the others. These porticoes
are supported by columns made of hard carved stones laid one
above the other and bound with molten lead. These columns
have no arches over them, after the style we have described
in the Mosque of the Apostle of God - may God bless and
preserve him. They are of enormous height, reaching to the
roof, so that the eyes are bewildered by their surpassing stature.
I have never seen on the earth a mosque with taller columns
or a higher roof.
In this holy mosque are many sacred monuments, among
which is a chamber beside the rnihrab, to the right of him who
faces the qiblah, that is said to have been the oratory of Abraham
the Friend (of God) - may God bless and preserve him. For
protection a black curtain is drawn over it, and it is from here
that the khatib emerges, dressed in black robes, to deliver the
khutbah. People throng around this blessed spot to pray. Hard
by it, to the right side of the qiblah, is a rnihrab enclosed by
240 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
a teak balustrade and rising from the paving of the arcade like
a small mosque. It is the mihrab of the Prince of the Faithful,
'Ah ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour - and in
that place the accursed wretch 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam
struck him with the sword, wherefore the people pray there,
weeping and beseeching. In a corner at the end of this south
portico, where it adjoins the end of the west portico, is a form
of small mosque also enclosed by a teak balustrade. It is here
that 'the water welled from the reservoir of the earth'95 [Koran
XI, 40, and XXIII, 27] in the miracle done for Noah - upon
whom be (eternal) happiness. Behind this, outside the mosque,
is the house wherein he dwelt, and behind this again is another
dwelling said to have been the place where Idris (Enoch)98
worshipped - may God bless and preserve him. Adjacent to
these two chambers is an open space that abuts on the south
wall of the mosque and is said to be the place where (Noah's)
ark was built. At the end of this space is the dwelling of 'Ah
ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour - and the
house where his body was bathed. Adjoining this is another
said to be the house of Noah's daughter - may God bless and
preserve them. These venerable traditions we received from the
tongue of a sheikh of the country, and we recorded them as
he told them. God best knows the truth of them all.
At the east side of the mosque one climbs to a small chamber
containing the tomb of Muslim ibn 'Aqil ibn Abi Talib - may
God hold him in His favour. North of the mosque a little way
is a large fountain of Euphrates water that has three big basins.
A parasang to the west of the city is the famous shrine named
after 'AH ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour -
said to be the place where the camel that bore him in his winding
sheet knelt, and to hold his tomb. God best knows the
truth of this. The construction of this shrine is most magnificent,
according to what we were told, for on account of the shortness
of our stay in al-Kufah, whereby we stayed there only
the night of Saturday, we did not see it. "We removed on the
morning of Saturday, and near to midday we halted at a canal
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (580) 241
flowing from the Euphrates, which river is half a parasang to
the east of al-Kufah. The eastern part (of al-Kufah) is all groves
of thickly growing palm-trees whose shade is contiguous and
stretches as far as the eye can see. Leaving this place, we passed
the night of Sunday, the last day of Muharram, in the neighbourhood
of al-Hillah, which we entered on Sunday.
A note on the city of al-Hillah
May God Most High protect it
Al-Hillah is a large and anciently constructed city of oblong
shape, nothing of whose walls remain except the earth-wall
enclosure that surrounds it. It lies upon the banks of the
Euphrates, which laps and stretches along the length of its
eastern side. It has splendid markets that comprehend all the
urban resources and intrinsic industries. It is solidly built, and
very populous; and both within and without the city are successive
palm-groves between which stand the dwellings. In it
we came upon a great bridge secured over a row of large
barges stretching from one bank to the other and having their
sides held together by massive iron chains, huge like twisted
rafters, that were attached to wooden posts fixed on either bank,
revealing great means and power (in those who built it). The
Caliph (al-Nasir li din Ilah) ordered the construction of this
bridge in his solicitude for the pilgrims and his care for their
comfort on the way. They had formerly crossed in boats; and
our pilgrims found (on their return) that this bridge which
had not been there when they were on their way to Mecca -
may God exalt it - had been constructed by the Caliph in their
absence. We crossed the bridge at midday on Sunday, and
encamped on the banks of the Euphrates a parasang away from
the town.
This river is like its name Furat [Prodigality], having the
sweetest and lightest97 of water. It is a great river, abundant of
water, which ships ascend and descend. The road from al-Hillah
to Baghdad is one of the best and most beautiful, running
242 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
between plains and cultivations, with continuous villages right
and left. These plains are traversed by canals from, the Euphrates
that flow through them and irrigate them, and the tillage on
them stretches broad and*wide without limit. Upon this road
the eyes roam happily and the souls are filled with cheer and
well-being, while the security upon it is continuous with our
praise to God. Glory to Him.
The Month of Safar of the Year 580
[14th of May-nth of June, 1184]
May God let us know His grace and favour
THE new moon of this month appeared on the night of
Monday corresponding with the 14th of May. It rose while
we were on the banks of the Euphrates outside the city of al-
Hillah. We removed on the morning of Monday, and crossed
a bridge over a waterway called al-Nil, a branch deriving from
the Euphrates. There was a great press, and many men and
animals were drowned in the water. We stood aside, resting
until the host should disperse, and then crossed in safety and
without harm. Praise be to God. From the city of al-Hillah
the pilgrims form a chain of men in companies and groups,
some going ahead, some keeping in the middle, and some lagging
behind. He in haste does not halt for the leisurely, nor
do those in the van await the tardy. Wherever they wish along
the road they may stop to take breath and to repose, their spirits
at rest from the fear of the drum beat that had caused their
hearts to tremble as it urged them to rise and depart. Sometimes
a sleeper would babble that he had heard the sound of the
drum, and rise hastily and fearfully and then, perceiving that
it was but an evil dream, return again to slumber.
Among the causes of their dispersion was the many bridges
they encountered on their way to Baghdad, for you can hardly
walk a mile without finding a bridge over a waterway branching
from the Euphrates. This is the road that has most fountains
and bridges, and along most of it are the tents of the men who
guard the road in the solicitude of the Caliph for the pilgrims,
that they might not be accosted for begging or the like. If
this throng of men had rushed headlong on to the bridges they
could never have crossed them, and would have fallen in heaps
upon each other.
244 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
The Emir Tashtikin, whom we have mentioned before, tarried
three days in al-Hillah until all the pilgrims had passed
before him, and then betook himself to His Majesty the Caliph,
on whose behalf he governs the province of Hillah. The conduct
of this Emir, in his kindness to the pilgrims, his care of
them, his watch over their van and rear, and his arrangement
of the right and left wings is worthy of praise. He followed
a well-directed path of firmness and foresight; and in modesty,
urbanity, and cordiality, his course was felicitous. May God
advantage him, and through him, the Muslims.
In the afternoon of Monday we halted at a village called
al-Qantarah [The Bridge] with broad and fertile lands watered
by canals and shaded by the foliage of trees in fruit. It is one
of the fairest and most beautiful of villages. Over a branch of
the Euphrates at this place, there is a large bridge, arched so
that one must climb and descend it, that gives its name to the
village, which is also known as Hisn al-Bashir [The Castle of
Bashir]. We found that in these regions the barley is reaped
at this time, which is the middle of May. We removed from
this village at daybreak on Tuesday the 2nd of Safar and stopped
for the midday rest at another called al-Farashah that has many
inhabitants, is traversed by waters, and is enfolded by a verdant
plain that is beautiful to behold. The villages of this road, from
al-Hillah to Baghdad, are all of this fashion, being fair and
broad. In this village there is a large khan surrounded by a
high wall with small merlons.
Leaving this place, we alighted in the evening at a village
called Zariran, which is one of the loveliest villages of the
earth, the finest to look upon, the broadest in its lands, and
the widest in its boundaries, possessing also the most gardens,
sweet-scented plants, and palm-groves. It has a market beside
which the markets of cities fall short. Concerning the excellence
of its site it is enough to tell you that die Tigris laves
its eastern side and die Euphrates the west and that it lies like
a bride between them. Between these noble and blessed rivers
stretch successive plains, villages, and cultivations.
1 Hii MUJN 1 n Uf JsAfAK (5°°J 245
Amongst the merits of this village is that on its eastern side
the Iwan Kisra [Palace of Chosroes] stands beside it, while
before it lies his city (al-Mada'in]. This palace is an edifice of
exceeding whitness soaring high into the skies, but of its structures
only a part remains. At the distance of a mile we saw it
rising, lofty and brilliant. As for al-Mada'in, it is in ruins. We
passed it at dawn on "Wednesday the 3rd of Safar and marvelled
at what we observed of its length and vastness. Another
of the virtues of this village of Zariran is that half a parasang
to the east of it is the shrine of Salman the Persian - may God
hold him in His favour-and its soil would not have been
chosen to contain these blessed remains but for its excellence.
The village lies on the banks of the Tigris, which flows between
it and the noble shrine.
We had heard that the air of Baghdad engenders gladness
in the heart and disposes the spirit to joy and conviviality so
that you will scarce find in it one who is not cheerful and gay,
even though he be a stranger and far from his home. So when
we had alighted at this place which is one stage from the city,
and had breathed its scented breezes and quenched our burning
thirsts from its cool waters, we felt, despite our alien loneliness,
the call to happiness, and on our rugged path we sensed
joy, the joy of the absent returning. We felt aroused in us the
promptings of good cheer, reminding us of the meetings of
loved ones in the brightness of youth. If so it is with the stranger
absent from his native land, how then shall it be for the pilgrim
returning to his kith and home?
'God watered Bab al-Taq with the drenching clouds,
And restored to his native land each stranger.'
At dawn on Wednesday we departed from this village and,
as we have described, passed Mada'in Kisra and came to Sarsar
which in beauty is a sister of Zariran or near to it. By its southern
side flows a large branch of the Euphrates, over which is a
bridge built on barges secured from bank to bank by huge
iron chains in the fashion we have described concerning the
246 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
bridge of al-Hillah. We crossed it and, passing the village,
halted for our noonday rest when, we were about three parasangs
from Baghdad. This village of Sarsar has a fine market
and a large new congregational mosque; it is one of the villages
that charge the soul from their beauty and goodliness.
The fame of these two rivers, the Tigris and the Euphrates,
is such that we need not describe them. Their confluence is
between Wasit and al-Basrah, where they pour into the sea,
and their course runs from north to south. It is enough in thenregard
to mention the special blessings bestowed by God upon
them and their brother the Nile, as is famous and well-known.
We removed from this place a little before noon on Wednesday
and came to Baghdad before the late afternoon, passing
into the city through gardens and meadows of which all
description must fall short.
A note on the City of Peace, Baghdad
May God Most High protect it
Baghdad is an ancient city, and although it has never ceased
to be the capital of the ' Abbaside Caliphate and the pivot of
the Qurayshite, Hashimite Imams' claims,98 most of its traces
have gone, leaving only a famous name. In comparison with
its former state, before misfortune struck it and the eyes of
adversity turned towards it, it is like an effaced ruin, a remain
washed out, or the statue of a ghost. It has no beauty that
attracts the eye, or calls him who is restless to depart to neglect
his business and to gaze. None but the Tigris which runs
between its eastern and its western parts like a mirror shining
between two frames, or like a string of pearls between two
breasts. The city drinks from it and does not thirst, and looks
into a polished mirror that does not tarnish. And the beauty of
its women, wrought between its waters and its air, is celebrated
and talked of through the lands, so that if God does not give
protection, there are the dangers of love's seductions.
As to its people, you scarce can find among them any who
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 247
do not affect humility, but who yet are vain and proud. Strangers
they despise, and they show scorn and disdain to their inferiors,
while the stories and news of other men they belittle. Each
conceives, in belief and thought, that the whole world is but
trivial in comparison with his land, and over the face of the
world they find no noble place of living save their own. It is
as if they are persuaded that God has no lands or people save
theirs. They trail their skirts trippingly and with insolence,
turning not, in deference to God, from that of which He disapproves,
deeming that the highest glory consists in trailing
one's mantle, and knowing not that the garment, in accordance
with tradition, shall go to the flames. Their business they
contract with 'borrowed' gold, but none among them 'give
any loan to God' [i.e. give alms] [Koran II, 246]. There are no
transactions save with 'borrowed' dinars and at the hands of
those who give short measure in weighing.* You can hardly
gain the better of the leading men of its inhabitants by honest
truthfulness, and there is not one of its weighers and measurers
to whom does not apply the 'Woe to the (defaulters)' of the
Surah of the Defaulters [Koran LXXXIII, where those who
give short measure are condemned]. They feel no shame in
this, as if they were the remainder of the Midianites, the people
of the Prophet Shu'ayb [Koran VII, 85 et seq., where the
prophet Shu'ayb exhorts his people of Midian to give full
measure and to worship God alone, and is rejected by them
with scom. They are destroyed by an earthquake, as in time
are these people of Baghdad in the massacre by the grandson
of Jengiz Khan]. The stranger with them is without fellowship,
his expenses are doubled, and he will find amongst them
none who do not practise hypocrisy with him or make merry
with him only for some profit or benefit. It is as if they are
forced to this false form of friendship as a condition of gaining
peace and agreement in their lives together. The illconduct
of the people of this town is stronger than the character
* The author makes play on the word qard, which means both 'borrowed'
and 'parcc.'. He means that the Baghdadians gave short measure in their gold.
248 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of its air and. water, and detracts from the probity of its traditions
and its reports.
I beg the pardon of God for them all save their traditionbearing
faqihs and recollective preachers, for there is no doubt
that in the way of preaching and rerninding, in persistent
admonishment and making to understand, in the assiduous
giving of fearful warnings and cautions, they are in a position
to claim God's compassion such as will unload these people
of many sins, pull the train of pardon over their sinful steps,
and prevent the severest disaster from falling upon their houses.
But with such men they are beating steel when cold, and seeking
to make ice gush water. Hardly a congregational Friday
passes but that a preacher addresses them, and the most successful
of them remains all his days in recollective assemblies,
which is a felicitous and necessary course. The first of these
whose discourses we attended was the sheik and imam Radi
al-Din al-Qazwini, head of the Shafi'is, and theologian at the
Nizamiyah College, and distinguished for his pre-eminence in
fundamental studies. We went to the lecture he gave following
the afternoon prayer of Friday the 5th of the month of
Safar. He ascended the pulpit and the readers, who were on
chairs in front of him, began to recite. They filled one with
yearning and longing with pleasing voices and sad and moving
melodies. The imam then delivered a quiet and grave discourse
that dealt with the various branches of learning, including a
commentary on the Book of Great and Glorious God and an
exposition of the traditions of His Apostle - may God bless
and preserve him - with an explanation of their meaning. Like
a shower of rain, questions were sprinkled upon him from all
sides, and these he did not fall short to answer, and was prompt
to do so, delaying not. A number of notes were passed to him
and, gathering them together in his hand, he began to answer
each one, throwing away each note as he dealt with it, until
he had come to the end. When evening fell he descended and
the assembly dispersed. His disquisition was learned and homiletic,
grave, quiet, and persuasive, revealing God's blessing and
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 249
his calmness of soul; and the souls of the humble did not grudge
the flowing of tears, especially at the end of the convocation
when his exhortations dissolved them in contrition and weeping,
and caused the repentant to rush into his arms. How many
were the forelocks he cut! To how many arguments of the
penitent did he apply his theme and cut them! It is by the
like of men of the standing of this blessed sheik that the rebellious
come to be forgiven and sinners to be absolved, and that
protection and salvation are continued. God Most High will
reward every man of standing according to his position, and
by reason of the blessedness of the learned saints will shield
from His displeasure and vengeance those of His servants who
are perverse. This from His mercy and bounty for He is the
Benefactor, the Generous. There is no Lord but He, and only
He may be worshipped.
We went to another of his dissertations, this time after the
evening prayers on Friday the 12th of the month. His gathering
that day was attended by the chief of the doctors of al-
Khurasan, head of the Shafi'i imams. He entered the Nizamiyah
College with a great stir and a turning of the eyes of spirits longing
for him. The imam we have mentioned above commenced
his discourse, delighted at the presence of this learned man
and much honoured by it. All the branches of theology came
under his review, as in the meeting we have already described.
This chief of the learned doctors was Sadr al-Din al-Khujandi,
already mentioned in this journal, famous for his beneficent
and bounteous acts, and first among the great and illustrious.
On the morning of the Saturday following we attended the
sermon of that sheik, faqih, and imam, the only Jamal al-Din
Abu 1-Fada'il ibn 'Ali al-Jawzi, given beside his house on the
eastern bank (of the river). Adjoining, with its extremity,
the palaces of the Caliph, it is near to the Bab al-Basaliyyah,
the last of the gates on the eastern side (of the city), and here he
gives a discourse every Saturday. And we were present at the
sermon of a man who is no 'Amr or Zayd [i.e. no ordinary
man]. 'Under the fur is the prey';99 he is the wonder of all time,
2jo THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and the consolation of the faith. He was the head of the
Hanbalis and a specialist in learning of the highest rank, an imam
of the mosque, and a cavalier on the track at that calling,
renowned for his splendid triumphs of eloquence and learning,
controlling the reins of verse and of rhymed prose, and one
who has dived deep into the sea of thought and brought forth
precious pearls. His verse is Radi's in temper but after the
manner of Mihyar; as for his rhymed prose, it reveals the
bewitching eloquence that annuls comparison with Quss and
Sahban. One of his most splendid marvels and greatest miracles
was the following: On his ascending the pulpit, the readers,
who numbered more than twenty, began to recite the Koran.
Two or three of them spoke a verse of the Koran in a moving
and impassioned rhythm, and when they had done, another
group of the same number recited another verse. So they went
on, alternately reciting verses, from various chapters, until they
had ended the reading. The verses they gave were so similar
that even a man of ready mind could scarce tell the number
or name the order; yet when they had finished, this great and
remarkable imam, passing speedily into his disquisition and
pouring into the shells of our ears the pearls of his utterance,
punctuated his discourse at each paragraph with the rhyming
opening words of the verses recited, giving them in the order
of their reading without prematurity or deferment, and ending
with the rhyme of the last.
If anyone present at his sermon had thought to name what was
recited verse by verse in the proper order he would have failed.
What then of one who fits them rapidly and extemporarily
to a fine sermon! 'Is not this an enchantment, then, or do you
not see?' [Koran LII, 15]. 'Surely this is manifest favour' [Koran
XXVII, 16]. 'Speak of this sea of knowledge, and be not narrow
in his praise.'100 Ah, but how far is talk of him from reality!
When he had ended his sermon, he offered some gentle
exhortations and talked of some clear events in his memory,
so that hearts were struck with longing, spirits melted with
ardour, and the sobs of weeping resounded. The penitent raised
THE MONTH OF SAFAR. (580) 251
loud their voices and fell on him like moths on a lamp. Each
one offered him his forelock, and this he cut, and, touching
each man's head, he prayed for him. Some fainted and he
raised them to him in his arms. We witnessed an awesome
spectacle which filled the soul with repentance and contrition,
reminding it of the dreads of the Day of Resurrection. Had
we ridden over the high seas and strayed through the waterless
desert only to attend the sermon of this man, it would
have been a gainful bargain and a successful and prosperous
journey. Praise be to God who granted that we should meet
with him of whose merit manimate things bear witness and
whose like the world is too small to contain. Throughout his
audience, questions came rapidly upon him and notes flew to
him and quicker than the twinkling of an eye he answered.
At times most of his sparkling collucution would consist of
answering these questions. But excellence is in the hand of God,
and He grants it to whom He wills. There is no God but He.
We went to another of his addresses on the morning of
Thursday the n t h of the month of Safar at the Bab Badr, in
the square of the palaces of the Caliph, whose belvederes overlook
it. This place is part of the harim of the Caliph, and is
set apart for the reception of those who come to preach there,
so that the Caliph, his mother, and the ladies of his harim might
listen from the belvederes. The Gate is opened to the people
who enter the place, which is spread with mats. The imam
holds a meeting there every Thursday, and in the early morning
we came to see him, sitting until the learned speaker arrived.
Climbing the pulpit, he loosened the taylasan from his head
in deference to the standing of the place. The Koran readers,
who were arranged in a line before him in chairs, soon began
to recite in order, filling one with longing and emotion as they
wished, and the eyes speedily dropped tears. When they had
ended, and we had counted them as doing nine verses from
different chapters (of the Koran), he began a discourse that was
brilliant and superb, and set throughout with the opening words
of the verses. So the sermon went, rhyming with the last verse
252 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of the series until it finished. The verse was: 'God is He who
made for you the night that you may rest therein, and the
day to see in: God indeed is bountiful to men' [Koran XL, 61],
and he continued (rhyming) in sin [the last letter of the verse
just quoted] and achieving a fine effect. That day was more
remarkable than the one before. He began to eulogise the
Caliph, and to pray for him and his noble mother, who bore
the by-names of al-Sitr al-Ashraf [The Most Noble Veiled One]
and of al-Janab al-'Ar'af [Her Most Compassionate Excellency].
He then pursued his exhortation, all extempore and without
preparation, and again introducing the verses in the order of
their recital. Eyes poured forth their tears, and souls revealed
their secret longings. Men threw themselves upon him, confessing
their sins and showing their penitence. Hearts and minds
were enravished, and there was great commotion. The senses
lost their understanding and discernment, and there was no way
to restraint.
During his audience he recited erotic poems of great passion,
and of remarkable sensibility, firing hearts with emotion and
turning from eroticism to asceticism. The last thing he recited,
when his audience was already in a state of reverence, stricken
by the arrows of his eloquence, was:
'Where is my heart which love hath melted?
Where is my heart not yet restored?
O Sa'd increase my passion with memories of them,
Tell me, by Allah, O Sa'd, hast thou been redeemed (from
the miseries of separation)?'
Unceasingly lie repeated these verses, his emotion visible
upon him, tears almost preventing the issue of words from his
mouth, until we feared he would be choked. He hastened to
rise and descended from the pulpit speedily, but in a haze. He
had inspired hearts with fear and left men on burning coals.
They accompanied him with red eyes, openly weeping, and
some were rolling in the dust. Oh what a sight! How awesome
to look upon! How happy was he who saw it! God by
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 253
His grace and favour gave us to profit of this man's blessedness,
putting us among those who might through him share
of His mercy.
At the beginning of his meeting, he recited an ode, bright
as fire, 'Iraqi in manner, concerning the Caliph. It opened:
'In the embroilment of love, he is as one struck by the
lightning on the slopes of (Mount) 'AqiT
and in speaking of the Caliph said, 'O words of God, be an
amulet against the evil eye through the perfect imam.'
When he had finished his recital the assembly was shaken
with emotion. He then began his function, and long displayed
to us the enchantment of his exposition. We had not thought
that a speaker of this world could so possess the soul and operate
on it as did this man. Glory to God who endows exclusively
with perfection those of His servants whom He wills. There
is no God but He.
After this meeting, we went to other preachers in Baghdad,
and we marvelled at their excellence in comparison with the
speakers we knew in the west. In Mecca and Medina-may
God exalt them - we had attended the meetings of those whom
we have mentioned in this journal, but they were poor beside
those of this unrivalled man in their power over our souls,
and we did not find them so good as their repute. 'Where is
the readiness I would like?' What a difference between the
two! How many young men there are, but those like Malik
are few.101 After this we went to another meeting that was
most good to hear and that roused the attention. A third mejlis
of his we attended on Saturday the 13 th of Safar, in the place
we have mentioned, beside his house on the eastern bank (of
the river). His wondrous eloquence took all forms. We witnessed
one notable example of his powers: through his exhortation
the souls of those present rose as clouds, and from their
tears there poured a heavy shower of rain. Then, at the end of
his meeting, he delivered some erotic verses, ardently mystical
and emotional. At last, weakness overcame him and he sprang
254 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
from the pulpit, sad and distressed, but leaving all repenting
of themselves, weeping and sadly crying, 'Alas, what a pity!'
The weepers moved round like a mill-stone, wailing and all
still unrestored from their intoxication. Glory to God who
created him to instruct those that have minds, and made him
the greatest cause for the penitence of his servants. There is
no God but He.
We now return to our description of Baghdad
As we have said, this city has two parts, an eastern and a
western, and the Tigris passes between them. Its western part
is wholly overcome by ruin. It was the first part to be populated,
and the eastern part was but recently inhabited. Nevertheless,
despite the ruins, it contains seventeen quarters, each
quarter being a separate town. Each has two or three baths,
and in eight of them is a congregational mosque where the
Friday prayers are said. The largest of these quarters is al-
Qurayah, where we lodged in a part called al-Murabba' [the
Square] on the banks of the Tigris and near to the bridge. This
bridge had been carried away by the river in its flood, and the
people had turned to crossing by boats. These boats were
beyond count; the people, men and women, who night and
day continuously cross in recreation are likewise numberless.
Ordinarily, and because of the many people, the river had two
bridges, one near the palaces of the Caliph, and the other above
it. The crossings in the boats are now ceaseless.
Then (comes the quarter of) al-Karkh, a noted city,102 then
that of Bab al-Basrah [the Basra Gate], which also is a city
and has in it the mosque of al-Mansur - may God hold him
in His favour. It is a large mosque, anciently built, and embellished.
Next is (the quarter) al-Shari', also a city. These are
the four largest quarters. Between the al-Shari' and Bab al-
Basrah quarters is the Suq al-Maristan [the Market of the Hospital],
which itself is a small city and contains the famous
Baghdad Hospital. It is on the Tigris, and every Monday and
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 255
Thursday physicians visit it to examine the state of the sick,
and to prescribe for them what they might need. At their disposal
are persons who undertake the preparation of the foods
and medicines. The hospital is a large palace, with chambers
and closets and all the appurtenances of a royal dwelling. Water
comes into it from the Tigris. It would take long to name
the other quarters, like al-Wasitah, which lies between the
Tigris and a canal which branches off the Euphrates and flows
into the Tigris and on which is brought all the produce of the
parts watered by the Euphrates. Another canal passes by Bab
al-Basrah, whose quarter we have already mentioned, and flows
as well into the Tigris.
Another quarter is that called al-'Attabiyah, where are made
the clothes from which it takes its name,103 they being of silk
and cotton in various colours. Then comes al-Harbiyyah, which
is the highest (on the river bank) and beyond which is nothing
but the villages outside Baghdad. Other quarters there are that
it would take too long to mention. In one of them is the tomb
of Ma'ruf al-Karkhi, a pious man and famed amongst the
saints. On the way to the Bab al-Basrah is a splendidly built
shrine in which is a tomb with a large convex tombstone bearing
the words, 'This is the tomb of 'Awn and Mu'in104 sons
of the Prince of the Faithful 'Ah ibn Abu Talib' - may God
hold him in His favour. Also on the west side is the tomb of
Musa ibn Ja'far - may God hold them (father and son) in His
favour. Many other tombs there are105 of saints and men of
piety and men of noble forebears, whose names I cannot
recollect - may God hold them all in His favour.
To the east of the town, on an eminence outside it, is a large
quarter beside the quarter of al-Rusafah, where, on the bank,
was the famous Bab al-Taq [Gate of the Arch]. In this quarter
is a shrine, superbly built, with a white dome rising into the
air, containing the tomb of the imam Abu Hanifah - may God
hold him in His favour, by which name the quarter is known.
Near this quarter is the tomb of the imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal
- may God hold him in His favour - and also in this part is
256 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the tomb of Abu Bakr al-Shibli - may God's mercy rest upon
his soul - and that of al-Husayn ibn Mansur al-Hallaj. In Baghdad
many are the tombs of pious men - may God hold them
all in His favour.
In the western part of the city are the orchards and walledin
gardens whence are brought fruits to the eastern part. This
to-day is the home of the Caliph, and that is honour and circumstance
enough for it. The Caliph's palaces he at its periphery
and comprise a quarter or more of it, for all the 'Abbasides
[the family of the Caliph] live in sumptuous confinement in
those palaces, neither going forth nor being seen, and having
a settled stipend. A large part of these palaces is used by the
Caliph, and he has taken the high belvederes, the splendid halls,
and the delightful gardens. To-day he has no vizier, having
only an official called Vice-Vizier who attends the council
which deals with the property of the Caliph, and who holds
the books and controls affairs. He has an Intendant over all the
'Abbasid palaces, and an amin [a person of confidence] over
all the harim [harem] remaining from the time of the Caliph's
grandfather and father, and all those included in the Caliph's
own harem. He is called al-Sahib Majd al-Din Ustad al-Dar,
which is his title, and prayers are said for him after those for
the Caliph. He appears little before the public, being busy
with his affairs concerning the palaces, their guardianship, the
responsibility for their locks, and their inspection night and
day.
The lustre of this reign consists only in pages and negro
eunuchs, among them being a youth called Khalis who is the
commander of the whole army. We saw him one day going
forth, preceded and followed by officers of the army, Turkish,
Daylami [Persian] and others, and surrounded by about fifty
drawn swords in the hands of the men about him. In his regard
we saw things strange in our time. He has palaces and belvederes
on the Tigris. The Caliph would sometimes be seen
in boats on the Tigris, and sometimes he would go into the
desert to hunt. He goes forth in modest circumstance in order
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 257
to conceal his state from the people, but despite this concealment
his fame only increases. Nevertheless, he likes to appear
before the people, and. show affection for them. They deem
themselves fortunate in his character, for in his time they have
obtained ease, justice, and good-living, and great and small they
bless him. We saw this Caliph Abu 1-'Abbas Ahmad al-Nasir
li din Ilah ibn al-Mustadi' bi Nur Ilah Abu Muhammad al-
Hasan ibn al-Mustanjid bi Ilah Abu '1 Muzaffar Yusuf, whose
lineage goes back to Abu '1-Fadl Ja'far al-Muqtadir billah and
beyond him to his ancestors the Caliphs - may God hold them
in His favour - in the western part in front of his belvedere
there. He had come down from it and went up the river in
a boat to his palace high on the east bank. He is a youth in
years, with a fair beard that is short but full, is of handsome
shape and good to look on, of fair skin, medium stature, and
comely aspect. He is about five and twenty years of age.
He wore a white dress like a qaba' [a full-sleeved gown],
embroidered with gold, and on his head was a gilded cap
encircled with black fur of the costly and precious kind used
for (royal) clothes, such as that of the marten or even better.
His purpose in wearing this Turkish dress was the concealment
of his state, but the sun cannot be hidden even if veiled. This
was on the evening of Saturday the 6th of Safar of the year
580, and we saw him again on the evening of the Sunday following,
gazing from his belvedere on the west bank. It was
nearby this that we lodged.
The eastern part of the city has magnificent markets, is
arranged on the grand scale and enfolds a population that none
could count save God Most High, who computes all things.
It has three congregational mosques, in all of which the Friday
prayers are said. The Caliph's mosque, which adjoins the palace,
is vast and has large water containers and many and excellent
conveniences - conveniences, that is, for the ritual ablutions
and cleansing. The Mosque of the Sultan is outside the city,
and adjoins the palaces also named after the Sultan known as
the Shah in Shall. He had been the controller of the affairs of
258 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the ancestors of this Caliph and had lived there, and the mosque
had been built in front of his residence. The (third) mosque,
that of al-Rusafah, is in the eastern part, and between it and
the mosque of the Sultan lies about a mile. In al-Rusafah is
the sepulchre of the 'Abbaside Caliphs - may God's mercy rest
upon their souls. The full number of congregational mosques
in Baghdad, where Friday prayers are said, is eleven.
The baths in the city cannot be counted, but one of the
town's sheiks told us that, in the eastern and western parts
together, there are about two thousand. Most of them are
faced with bitumen, so that the beholder might conceive them
to be of black, polished marble; and almost all the baths of
these parts are of this type because of the large amount of
bitumen they have. The question of this bitumen is strange:
it is brought from a well between Basra and al-Kufah from
which God has caused to ooze the fluid that produces the
bitumen. It comes over the sides of the spring like clay and is
scooped up and, after congealing, carried away. Glory to God
who creates what He wishes. There is no God but He. The
(ordinary) mosques in both the eastern and the western parts
cannot be estimated, much less counted. The colleges are about
thirty, and all in the eastern part; and there is not one of them
that does not outdo the finest palace. The greatest and most
famous of them is the Nizamiyah, which was built by Nizam
al-Mulk and restored in [A.H.] 504. These colleges have large
endowments and tied properties that give sustenance to the
faqihs who teach in them, and are dispensed on the scholars.
A great honour and an everlasting glory to the land are these
colleges and hospitals. God's mercy on him who first erected
them, and on those who followed in that pious path.
The eastern part has four gates: first that on the high part
of the bank, the Bab al-Sultan; then Bab al-Safariyah; then
the Bab al-Halbah; and then Bab al-Basaliyah. These are the
gates in the walls that surround the city from the high to the
low parts of the bank and wind round it in a long semicircle.
Inside, in the markets, are many gates. To be short, the state
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 259
of this city is greater than can be described. But ah what is
she to what she was! To-day we may apply to her the saying
of the lover:
' You are not you, and the houses are not those I knew'10*
Our departure from Baghdad to Mosul took place after the
afternoon prayers of Monday the 15th of Safar, which was
the 28th of May. Our stay in Baghdad had been thirteen days.
We were in the company of two princesses, the princess
daughter of Mas'ud, already mentioned in this journal, and
the princess mother of Mu'izz al-Din, Lord of Mosul. With
them were the pilgrims of Syria, of Mosul, and of the Persian
lands adjoining Darb which are subject to the Emir Mas'ud,
father of one of these two princesses. The pilgrims of Khurasan
and the lands about it journeyed with a third princess, the
daughter of the King al-Daqus [see note 80]. They took the
road from the eastern side of Baghdad; ours to Mosul was
from the western side. These two princesses were the Emirs
and commanders of the troops with whom we went. May
God not apply to us the saying:
'The troops perished with their commander.'
These princesses had soldiers in their own pay, and the Caliph
had added soldiers to accompany them, in fear of the Bedouin
tribe of the Khafajah whose tents were pitched around Baghdad.
The Mas'udi princess, with many youths and much circumstance,
came suddenly upon us the evening of our departure
from Baghdad. She was withdrawn inside a domed litter placed
on two poles that lay between two beasts, one ahead of the
other and decked with gilded caparisons. The animals carried
her along like a zephyr, speedily and gently. There was an opening
both in the front and in the rear of the litter, inside which
could be seen the princess, veiled and wearing a golden headband.
Before her went a mounted troop of her youths and
soldiers. On her right were the nags and excellent hackneys,
while behind her was a party of her handmaidens riding both
nags and hackneys, on gold-worked saddles. They also wore
260 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
golden head-bands whose ends fluttered in the breeze. Like a
cloud they moved behind their mistress, with banners and
timbals and trumpets which they sounded at the mount and
dismount. Indeed we saw such pride of feminine sovereignty,
such solemn ceremony of rank, as should shake the earth and
gloriously trail behind it the robe-trains of the world. And it
was fair that glory should serve it, and that this tremor should
occur for it.
The kingdom of her father extends over four months'
journey. The ruler of Constantinople pays him tribute. He rules
his subjects with admirable equity, and (against the Christians)
wages holy war unceasingly and in a manner most laudable. One
of the pilgrims from our country told us that in this present year
of 579 he had conquered about twenty-five Byzantine cities.
His by-name is 'Izz al-Din, but his father's name was Mas'ud,
and he himself is more commonly known by this name, which
is hereditary in that dynasty, going from father to son. One
of the glories of this princess, who is named Saljuqah, is that
Saladin conquered Amid, the city of her husband Nur al-Din
and one of the biggest in the world, but left the city to her in
honour of her father and gave her the keys. Because of this,
her husband remained king. But enough for you of this affair.
The King of Kings, the Giver of Life, the Self-Existent gives
power to whom He wills. There is no God but He.
We passed that night in one of the villages of Baghdad.
When we arrived, part of the night had gone. Near to it flows
the Dujayl, a tributary of the Tigris that waters all those villages.
We removed from this place on the morning of Tuesday
the 16th of Safar, and the villages on our way were continuous.
We prolonged our march until after the midday prayer, when
we dismounted and waited the rest of our day that the pilgrims
who lagged behind, and the merchants of Syria and
Mosul, might overtake us. Then, a little before midnight, we
resumed our journey and pursued the march until day had
risen when we alighted to rest in shade beside the Dujayl. All
that night we journeyed on, and with the morning descended
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 261
near a village called al-Harba, one of the most fertile and extensive
of villages. Leaving that place, we travelled all night, and
on the morning of Thursday the 18th of Safar we encamped
on the banks of the Tigris near a fort called al-Ma'shuq and
said to have been a lodge of al-Zubaydah, cousin and wife of
al-Rashid - may God hold him in His mercy.
Facing this place, on the eastern bank, lies the city of Surra
man Ra'a [Samarra or 'Pleased is he who looks upon it']107
which is to-day a lesson to him who looks upon it. Where
is its Mu'tasim, its Wathiq and its Mutawakkil [past Caliphs]?
It is a large city, but in ruins save for a part which is still
inhabited. Al-Mas'udi - may God's mercy rest upon his soul -
dilated on its description, praising its good air and beauty, and
it is as he portrayed it even though only a trace of its splendour
remains. 'God inherits the earth and all upon it' [Koran XIX,
40]. There is no other God but He. All that day we stayed
there resting, a stage distant from Takrit, and on departing
from the place, journeyed all night. At dawn on Friday the
19th of the month (of Safar), which was the 1st of June, we
came to Takrit and halted outside it to rest that day.
An account of the city of Takrit
May God Most High protect it
Takrit is a large city, with a wide countryside and spacious
open places. With fine markets and many mosques, it has a
large population who are of better character and who give
fairer measure than the people of Baghdad. Through it passes
the Tigris, on whose banks it has a strong fortress that is its
impregnable citadel. Around the city are walls which show
signs of weakness. It is one of the ancient towns we have
mentioned.
We left it on the evening of the same day and journeyed
throughout the night; and on the morning of Saturday the
20th of the month, being on the banks of the Tigris, we halted
Q
262 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
to repose. From that place a supply of water for a day and
night is collected, and this we did and left in the forenoon.
Until night we rode and then put down to rest and steal a
measure of sleep. We dozed a little, and then removed, marching
on through that night and the morning of Sunday, and
prolonging our movement until the sun had well risen. We
alighted for our midday rest at a village on the banks of the
Tigris called al-Jadaydah. Near it is a large village, which we
had passed, called al-'Aqr winch is topped by a high hill that
in the past was the site of a fort and at the bottom of which is
a modem khan with towers and merlons, finely and strongly
built. The villages and cultivation from this place to Mosul
are continuous. It is here that the pilgrim order of march breaks
up, each one going his way at his pleasure, speeding ahead or
falling back, slowly or speedily, safe, and with mind at rest.
We left it in the late afternoon, and marched until evening,
when we halted, and, while the camels ate, snatched a moment
of slumber. Before midnight we set forward again and travelled
until the morning. In the forenoon of that day, Monday the
22nd of Safar, the 4th of June, we passed a place called al-
Qayarah, near the Tigris on its eastern bank. On the right of
the road to Mosul is a depression in the ground, dark like a
cloud, in which God has caused wells, large and small, to spout
forth bitumen. Some of them at times discharge a froth as if
it were boiling. Troughs have been made to collect it, and you
may see it spread over the ground like clay. It is black, smooth,
shiny, and soft, has a sweet smell, and is very viscid, sticking
to the finger immediately it is touched. Around these springs
is a large black pond thinly overspread with something like
a black moss which it casts to the sides, there to precipitate
into bitumen.
We saw a remarkable thing which, whenever we heard of
it, we wondered at. Near to these springs, on the banks of the
Tigris, is another large one whose fumes we could see from a
distance. And we were told that when they want to remove
the bitumen, they light a fire in it, the fire dries out the moisture,
i nil MUJNlrl Ur bArAK ^5°°/ 263
the bitumen congeals, and then they cut it in pieces and carry
it away. It is found in all lands as far as Syria, Acre, and all the
coastal regions. God indeed creates what He wishes. Glory to
Him. Exalted be His greatness, sublime His power. There is
no Lord save He. There is no doubt that of this kind is the
well which we were told lies between al-Kufah and Basra as
we have mentioned in this journal.
It is two stages from this place to Mosul, and we passed by
these bituminous wells to stop for our midday rest. We then
moved on until evening and alighted at a village called al-
Uqaybah, whence, if God wills, one can reach Mosul in the
morning. So we left it after midnight and reached Mosul when
day had risen on Tuesday the 23rd of Safar, the 5th of June,
and dismounted in a suburb in one of the inns near the bank
of the river.
An account of the city of Mosul
May God Most High protect it
This city is a large and ancient one, fortified and imposing,
and prepared against the strokes of adversity. Its towers are
aligned so closely together as almost to touch. Inside them are
chambers, one above the other, that run round the walls that
encompass the whole city. It was possible to open up these
chambers because of the thickness of the structure and the width
of the foundations. To warriors these chambers are a safe refuge,
and they are a useful appurtenance of war. At the highest point
of the town is a great fortress, with stones compactly set, and.
surrounded with ancient walls with lofty towers. Adjacent to
it are the houses of the Sultan. Between them and the town is
a broad street that stretches from the top of the town to the
bottom. The Tigris flows east of the town, touching its walls
whose towers rise from its waters. The town has a large suburb
with mosques, baths, khans, and markets.
One of the Emirs of the town, called Mujahid al-Din, constructed
on the banks of the Tigris a congregational mosque
264 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
than which I have never seen a more splendid. It is impossible
to describe its architectural ornament and its arrangement. It
is covered with reliefs in terra-cotta, and its maqsurah makes
one think of those in Paradise. Round it are iron latticed
windows, adjoined by benches overlooking the Tigris than
which there could be no nobler or more beautiful place to sit in.
The description of this mosque would take long, and for brevity
we have given but a passing glimpse of it. In front of it stands
a finely-built hospital erected by Mujahid al-Din, whom we
have mentioned above. He also built, in the market within the
town, a qaysariyah10* for the merchants. This is like a large
khan, and is bolted with iron doors and surrounded by shops
and houses one over the other. It is decorated throughout in
a splendid manner, and of an architectural elegance that has
no like, for I have never in any land seen a qaysariyah to
compare with it.
The city has two mosques, one new and the other of the
time of the 'Ummayids. In the courtyard of this latter is a
dome in which rises a marble pillar whose shaft is encircled
by five rings, twisted like bracelets, which are carved from the
body of the marble, and at whose top is an octagonal marble
basin from which projects a pipe. From this water spurts forth
with such energy and strength that it rises into the air, like
a straight glass wand, more than a man's height, and then falls
to the foot of the dome. The Friday prayers are said in both
these mosques, the old and the new, as well as in the mosque
in the suburb. The city has six or more colleges for the pur-
. suit of learning. They are on the Tigris and appear as high
castles. It has as well hospitals besides the one we mentioned in
the suburb. God has specially endowed this town with the holy
earth which holds the tomb of Jirjis [St. George]109 - may God
bless and preserve him. Over it a mosque has been built, and
his tomb is in one of its rooms, on the right of him who enters.
This mosque stands between the new mosque and the Gate
of the Bridge, and will be found on the left of him who goes
towards the (new) mosque from the Gate. We were blessed
Irih MUJNIH Or bArAR (5°°j 265
by our visit to this holy tomb and by standing at it. God gave
us this advantage.
Amongst the benefits God has specially conferred on this
town is that about a mile to the east of it, across the Tigris, is
the Hill of Penitence. It is the hill on which stood Yunus
Jonah-on whom be (eternal) happiness - with his people,
and prayed with them until God relieved them of their distress.
Near to this hill, also about a mile away, is the blessed
spring named after him. It is said that he enjoined his people
to purify themselves in it and to take thought of repentance,
and that then they ascended the hill praying. On the hill is
a large edifice which acts as an asylum for the needy with
many chambers, rooms, and ablution and drinking places, all
approached by one door. In the middle of this building is a
pavilion over which hangs a curtain, and below this is bolted
a blessed door, wholly inlaid. It is related that this is the place
where Yunus stood - may God bless and preserve him - and
that the mihrab of this pavilion was the chamber in which he
worshipped. Around the pavilion are candles, thick as the
trunks of palm-trees. Men go out to this asylum every Friday
night and there devote themselves to God's worship. Around
the asylum are many villages. Beside them is a great ruin said to
have been the city of Ninawa [Nineveh], which was the city of
Yunus - on whom be (eternal) happiness. The remains of the wall
that surrounded it are still visible, and evident too are the openings
of the gates. The piles of its (ruined) towers are very high.
We slept in the blessed asylum the night of Friday the 26th
of Safar. In the morning we went to the blessed spring, drank
of its water, purified ourselves in it, and prayed in the mosque
beside it. God in His grace and favour will advantage us for
our aim in that.
The people of Mosul follow a righteous path, doing pious
works. You will meet none of them but has a cheerful countenance
and a soft word. They are generous to strangers, receiving
them kindly, and using justness in all their dealings with them.
Four days we abode in the city.
266 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
One of the most glittering of worldly spectacles and awesome
to behold we witnessed on Wednesday, the second day
of our arrival at Mosul. (It was the arrival) of the two princesses:
the mother of Mu'izz al-Din, Lord of Mosul, and the daughter
of the Emir Mas'ud whom we have already mentioned. All
the men without exception went forth on horse and on foot;
and the women left too, most of them riding and making a
numerous army. The Emir of the country, with the leaders
of his state, went out to meet his mother. The Mosul pilgrims
entered in the company of their princess with ceremony and
display. They had adorned the necks of their camels with
coloured silks and ornamental collars. The Mas'udi princess
entered at the head of her troop of handmaidens, while before
her was a body of the men who had conducted her. The dome
of her litter was wholly adorned with pieces of gold shaped
like new moons, with dinars the size of the palm of the hand,
and with chains and images of pleasing designs, so that hardly
any part of the dome could be seen. The two beasts that bore
her advanced with jaded steps, and the clatter of their trinkets
filled the ears. The golden ornaments on the necks of her beasts
and the mounts of her maidens formed together a sum of gold
beyond estimation. It was indeed a sight that dazzled the eyes
and provoked reflection. All sovereignty perishes save that of
the One God, the Subduer, who is without partner. More than
one of those persons, worthy of belief, who know of the
princess's affairs, told us that she is known for her piety and
charity and is celebrated for good deeds. Amongst these is her
spending, while on this Hejaz road, a vast sum of money in
alms and in (generous payment) of expenses of the road. She
venerates holy men and women, visiting them in disguise from
a wish to gain their prayers. Her conduct is remarkable, for
all this is with her youthful age and immersion in the pleasures
of the realm. But God guides in the right path those He wishes.
On the evening of the fourth day of our stay in this town,
which was Friday the 26th of Safar, we left it on the beasts
that we had bought in Mosul. We had dispensed with the
THE MONTH OF SAFAR (580) 267
offices of the camel-masters, but we should say that the Praised
Power had given us the company of only the best of them,110
and we thank Him for their long and continuous company
from Mecca - may God exalt it - to Mosul. We travelled that
Saturday night until after midnight, and then halted at a village
belonging to Mosul. We removed from it in the forenoon
of Saturday, and took our midday rest at a village called
'Ayn al-Rasad under a bridge arched over a stream in which
the water hastened by. We enjoyed a blessed repose. In the
village is a large new khan. In all the stages of the road there
are khans, and it happened that we passed our night in that
village. We left it by night and in the morning of Sunday, we
came to a village called al-Muwaylihah. From there we went
on to spend the night in a large village called Judal, which
has an ancient fort. That day we had seen to the right of our
road Jabal al-Judi, mentioned in the Book of God Most High
[Koran XI, 44] where came to rest the ark of Noah - on whom
be (eternal) happiness. The mountain is high and oblongshaped.
We moved on when day had well broken on Monday
the 29th of Safar, and stopped for the night in one of the
villages of Nasibin [Nisibis] a stage distant from it. The place
is called al-K.la.i.
The Month of Rabi' al-Awwal of the Year 580
[12th of June-nth of July, 1184]
May God let us know His favour
THE new moon of this month rose on the night of Tuesday
the 12th of June while we were in the aforementioned
village. We left it at dawn on that Tuesday and arrived at
Nasibin before midday.
An account of the city of Nasibin
May God protect it
Renowned for its age and its past, outwardly fresh, but
decrepit within, beautiful to look upon, and of medium size,
it stands in a verdant plain which stretches before and behind
it as far as the eye can reach. In this plain God has made to run
streams of water that irrigate it, and flow in all its parts. The
city is begirt with gardens, thick with trees bearing ripe fruits;
and round it there bends, like a bracelet, a river with its banks
beset with the gardens that cover it with their ample shade.
God's mercy upon Abu Nuwas al-Hasan ibn Hani' when he
says, 'Nasibin was pleased with me one day and I was pleased
with it (to live in). Oh that my lot in this world were Nasibin.'
Outside, the city is a natural Paradise, having the trees and
plants of Andalusia, radiant with abundance and prosperity,
and bright with urban splendour. But inside is the disorder of
the desert [i.e. of the Bedouins], so that the gaze does not turn
to it, and the eye finds no pleasant place to roam across and
no sign of beauty.
The river flows down to it from a spring that issues from
a nearby mountain. It divides at its source, one branch taking
its way through the plains and cultivations, and the other entering
the city and spreading through its streets and penetrating
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 269
some of its houses. One fork reaches the venerated mosque
and, passing through its court, pours into two basins, one in
the centre of the court and die other at its eastern gate, and
(finally) reaches two fountains at the side of the mosque. Over
this river has been built a bridge of hard stone that adjoins
the south gate of the city. There are two colleges and one
hospital in the place.
The Lord of Nasibin is Mu'in al-Din, brother of Mu'izz
al-Din, Lord of Mosul, and both the sons of Babek. Mu'in
possesses also the city of Sinjar, which is on the right of the
road to Mosul. In one of the northern angles of the venerated
mosque lives the sheik Abu '1-Yaqzan, black of body but white
[pure] of heart, and one of the saints whose minds God has
illuminated with faith, making them of those whose pious deeds
are everlastingly remembered. He is famous for his sermons
and renowned for his thaumaturgy. Emaciated by exclusive
devotion to God's service, and by asceticism, he is of those
whose garments are worn from devotions and is content with
what are woven with his own hand, neither does he put aside
food for the morrow. God rendered us happy by meeting him,
and according us the blessings of his prayers, on the evening of
Tuesday, the first of the month of Rabi' al-Awwal. Praise be
to Great and Glorious God that He gave us the favour of seeing
him, and the honour of shaking his hand. May God profit us
from his prayers; for He is the One who hears and who answers.
There is no God but He.
We lodged in Nasibin in a khan outside the city, and there
passed the night of Wednesday the 2nd of Rabi' al-Awwal.
We left in the morning in a large caravan of mules and asses
with men from the Hauran and Aleppo and some others from
Bilad Bakr and its surroundings, leaving behind the pilgrims
of these parts on camels. Our march continued until the beginning
of noon. We were ready and on guard against an attack
by the Kurds who were the scourge of these parts, from Mosul
to Nasibin and the city of Dunaysar, robbing on the highway
and 'striving to make mischief in the land' [Koran V, 33 and
270 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
64]. They live in inaccessible mountains fast by these lands,
whose Sultan has not been helped by God to subdue them and
their transgressions. Sometimes they (even) reach the gate of
Nasibin, and none can repel or hinder them save Great and
Glorious God.
We took our midday rest that Wednesday, on which day
we saw to the right of our road, close by the side of the mountain,
the ancient city of Dara, large and white, with a towering
fort. Nearby, at a distance of half a stage, is the city of
Maridin, which sits on the mountain's edge and has at its
summit a large castle that is one of the celebrated castles of
the world. Both these cities are inhabited.
An account of the city of Dunaysar
May God protect it
This city lies in a wide plain, and is surrounded by gardens
of aromatic plants and green vegetables that are irrigated by
means of water-wheels. It inclines to the character of the desert
and has no walls. Filled with people, it has crowded markets
and a wide range of commodities, being the emporium of the
people of Syria, Diyar Bakr, Amid, of the Rumi lands that give
allegiance to the Emir Mas'ud, and of surrounding countries.
It has a wide tillage and many conveniences. With the caravan,
we encamped in an open space behind the city, and spent the
morning of Thursday the 3rd of Rabi' al-Awwal resting there.
Outside the city is a new college - the other buildings being
beside it - adjoined by a bath and encompassed by gardens. It
is at once a college and a pleasant place of retreat.
The Lord of this city is Qutb al-Din, who is also Lord of the
cities of Dara, Maridin, and Ra's al-'Ain. He is a kinsman of
the two sons of Babek. These countries are subject to various
rulers, after the fashion of the kings of the Arab nations in
Spain. All these rulers embellish themselves with titles connected
with religion [Din], and you will hear only awesome
by-names and appellations that for the wise are without profit.
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) XJ1
In this, the subjects and their kings are the same, and the rich
share the habit with the poor. Not one of them is known by
a cognomen that fits him, or is described by an epithet of which
he is worthy. Not one save Salah al-Din [Saladin], Lord of
Syria, the Hejaz, and the Yemen, and famous for his virtue
and justness. Here the name is in harmony with the subject,
and the words fit the meaning. All other titles are but a gust
of air, and testimonials made void. The taking on of religious
titles: what troubles they involve! 'Kingly titles out of place,
like a cat ambitious to mimic the lion's rush.'111
We return to the story of our journey - may God bring near
its end. We stayed in Dunaysar until we had said the midday
prayers of Friday the 4th of Rabi' (al-Awwal). The people in
the caravan had lingered there in order to see its market, for
every Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, there is a much
frequented market-day to which come the people of these parts
and of the adjacent villages. For continuous along the whole
road, right and left, are villages and tall khans. This market,
to which the people of these regions throng, is called the Bazar
[bazaar]. The market days are all fixed.
We left after the Friday prayers and passed a large village,
with a fort, called Tell al-'Uqab [the Hill of the Eagle], which
belongs to Christians who pay tribute for Muslim protection
[dhimmi]. This village reminded us of the villages of Andalusia
in its beauty and freshness, being surrounded by gardens, vineyards,
and all kinds of trees. Beside it flows a wide-coursed
river on which spreads the shade of the gardens lined along it.
There we saw sucking pigs, like sheep in their number and
their tameness towards the people there. Then, at the end of
the day, we came to another village called al-Jisr [the Bridge],
that now belongs to some clients (of the Muslims) who are
one of the various sects of the Rum; and there we passed the
night of Saturday, the 5th of Rabi'. With the dawn we betook
ourselves from it, and, before noon on that day, came to the
city of Ra's al-'Ain.
272 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
An account of the city of Ras al-'Ain
May God protect it
This name [the font of water] is a most fitting designation,
and in this place are the most excellent properties, for God
Most High has given vent to springs in its grounds that pour
forth fresh water. They divide into branches and flow in channels
spread through the green meadows like strips of silver
stretching across a sheet of emerald, beset with trees and gardens,
that are disposed along their banks till the end of their cultivated
valleys. Of these springs, two are the most copious, and
one is situated higher than the other. The higher rises from
the ground between hard stones that form something like the
hollow of a cave, large and capacious, in which the water rises
until it becomes as a vast cistern. The water then pours forth
like one of the greatest of rivers until it comes to the other
spring, with whose waters it unites. This second spring is one
of the most wonderful of the creations of Great and Glorious
God. It rises from hard stone at a depth of about four men's
statures below the ground, but the spring has opened out a
cistern of that depth, and the water, from the force of the
spring, rises until it flows over the earth's surface. Sometimes
a stout swimmer and strong diver into deep waters tries to
reach the bottom, but the water, so strong is the spring, repels
him, so that he does not reach half the depth and sometimes
even less. This we saw with our own eyes. The water is clearer
than pure water and sweeter than the spring of Salsabil, and
leaves visible all that is in it. If a dinar be thrown into it on
a dark night it will not be hidden. In it they catch a large fish
that is as tasty as any that exists. The water from this spring
divides into two branches, one going to the right, and the
other to the left. That to the right cuts through a convent built
beside the spring for the Sufis and for strangers and also called
al-Ribat [the Hospice]. That to the left flows beside the convent,
and then pours into channels that lead to the places of
ablution and other conveniences provided for the needs of man.
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 273
Then, below the convent, these two branches meet and join
with the river coming from the higher spring. On the bank
of the combined rivers hand-mills have been built, that reach
along the bank to a place in the middle of the river resembling
a dam. At the confluence of the waters of these two springs is
the source of the river al-Khabur.
Near this convent, for you can see it, is a college beside
which is a bath, and both are about to fall, being decayed and
abandoned. I do not think that there is in the world a site like
that of this college, for it is a green island, round which the
river curves on three sides, with access to it from the one (the
fourth). Front and rear it has a garden, and beside it is a waterwheel
that sends the water to a garden that is higher than the
level of the river. Indeed the whole state of this place is very
remarkable. If the villages of eastern Andalusia had such a
beautiful site or such sweet springs they would be of the very
best. God disposes of all that He creates.
As for the city itself, the interests of its Bedouin are cared
for and its urban side neglected. It has no walls to defend it,
and no finely built houses to adorn it. It has been sacrificed
as a victim to its deserts as if it were but an amulet for its
valleys. It has nevertheless all the conveniences of a town, and
has two mosques, one new and one old. The old mosque is
in the same place as the springs, and in front of it there gushes
a fresh spring, other than the two we have mentioned. It is
one of the buildings erected by 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz -
may God hold him in His favour - but the signs of age are
about it, and it announces its (coming) dissolution. The other
mosque is inside the town, and there the people assemble for
the Friday prayers. Our stay in the town that day had been
for refreshment, but in all our journey we had not been so
cheated.
On Saturday the 5th of Rabi', the 16th of June, we removed
from Ra's al-'Ain at sunset being wishful of profiting from the
darkness and coolness of the night, and evading the choking
heat of the middle day; because from that city to Harran was
274 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
two days' journey, and there were no habitations on the way.
On we fared until the morning, and alighted in the desert at
a well. We rested a little, and then set forth again when the
sun had risen on the morning of Sunday. We marched until
the afternoon and then dismounted at a well in a place where
there is a high tower with ancient ruins known as Burj Hawa
[The Tower of Eve]. There we passed (part of) the night and
then, after a short slumber, moved on until the morning,
arriving at the city of Harran with the dawn on Monday the
7th of Rabi', the 18th of June. Praise be to God for His
smoothing of the way.
A description of the city of Harran
May God protect it
This is a town with no beauty about it. It has no shade to
mitigate its feverish heat, and its climate follows from its name
[Harran=Hot]. Its water bears no acquaintance with freshness,
and its squares and outskirts never cease to burn from the heat
of its midday sun. No noontime place of rest will you find
there, and you will breathe no air that is not heavy. Thrown
into the naked waste, it has been founded in the midst of the
wilderness and, without the brightness of a city, its shoulders
have been stripped of the clothing of verdure.
But I beg the pardon of God. It is enough honour and merit
for this town that it is the ancient city connected with our
father Abraham - may God bless and preserve him. South of
the city, about three parasangs distant, is a blessed shrine which
contains a running spring that was a dwelling-place for him
and Sarah - the blessings of God upon them both - and was
their place of worship. Because of this blessed connection, God
has made the city an abode of ascetic saints and a site for
unworldly anchorites. Amongst their most eminent, we met
the sheik Abu '1-Barakat Hayyan ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, near the
mosque named after him. He lives in a zawiyah which he has
built in the south part of it. Close beside it, at the end of that
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) _2_75
side, is the zawiyah of his son 'Umar, who cleaves to it, and.
follows the path of his father, doing no wrong. In him I recognised
the character of Akhzam.112 When we came to the sheik,
who was above eighty years of age, he shook our hand and
prayed for us, and told us to find his son 'Umar. So we turned
aside for him and found him, whereupon he prayed for us.
We then bade them both farewell and departed, joyous at
meeting two men who lived for the life to come. We also met
in the old mosque the sheik and ascetic, Salmah, and found
him to be a peerless ascetic. He prayed for us, and questioned
us, and then we bade him farewell and went our way. There
is in the town another Salmah known as al-Makshuf al-Ra's
[He of the uncovered Head], who in humility to Great and
Glorious God never covers his head and from that takes
his name. When we came to the place where he lived,
we were told that he had gone forth into the desert on a
pilgrimage.
In this town are many men of goodwill who are just, kind
to strangers, and generous towards the poor. The people of
these cities, from Mosul to Diyar Bakr, Diyar Rabi'ah, and to
Syria, are of this way of being kind to strangers and bounteous
to the poor. The people of their villages are the same, and the
poor and destitute will never need amongst them. In this they
display a hereditary inclination to generosity. Indeed the attitude
of the people of these parts is remarkable. May God
advantage for them for what they are about. As for those
devoted to the worship of God, the ascetics, and the anchorites
in the hills: they are too many to be counted. May God, by
His grace and favour, profit the Muslims by their benedictions
and faithful prayers.
This town has markets that are admirably disposed and wonderfully
arranged. They are all roofed with wood, and men
within them are never out of the long shade. You pass through
them as you would pass through a house with large corridors.
At every point where four market roads meet a great dome
made of plaster has been erected and seems to indicate the
276 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
branching of these roads. Contiguous with these markets is the
venerated cathedral mosque, which is old but has been restored
and is of surpassing beauty. It has a great court, with three
domes raised on marble columns and under each dome is a
well of sweet water. Also in the court is a fourth dome, of
great size, raised on ten marble pillars, each nine spans in circumference.
In the centre of this dome is a huge marble pillar
fifteen spans in circumference. This dome was built by the
Rum. Its upper part is hollow as if it were a tall tower, and it
is said that it was a store for their furnitures of war. God best
knows. The venerated mosque is roofed with wooden rafters
and arches. The rafters are massive, and stretch the width of
the aisle which measures fifteen paces. There are five aisles,
and we have never seen a mosque with wider arches. The wall
that is contiguous with the courtyard through which entry is
made is full of doors; their number is nineteen, nine to the
right and nine to the left, the nineteenth being a huge door
that stands in their middle with its arch reaching from the top
of the wall to the bottom. It is a splendid sight, and of fine
conformation, as if it were the gate of a great city. Its many
wooden locks are beautifully worked and it is covered
with carving like the doors of the halls of palaces. In the
beauty of construction of this mosque and in the fine arrangement
of the adjoining markets, we observed a splendid
spectacle; and the harmony of design is such as is rarely found
in cities.
Harran possesses % college and two hospitals. It is a" considerable
town, with strong and formidable walls built of hewn
stones cemented together in the strongest fashion, as is the case
also in the construction of the venerated mosque. It has a strong
fortress on its eastern side, divided from it by a wide esplanade;
the fortress is also separated from the city walls by a great ditch
which, running round it, has its banks strengthened by piled
stones, resulting in great security and strength. The walls of
the fortress itself are strongly fortified.
Also to the east of the town, a small river runs between its
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 277
walls and its cemetery. Its source is a spring remote from the
town. The town has many inhabitants and is amply supplied;
it is clearly prosperous, has many mosques, is filled with conveniences,
and is the most splendid of cities. Its ruler is Muzaffar
al-Din ibn Zayn al-Din, who acknowledges the suzerainty of
Saladin. All this country, from Mosul to Nasibin and the
Euphrates is known as Diyar Rabi'ah. Its limit, from Nasibin
to the Euphrates, follows the south side of the road. Diyar
Bakr is the country which marches with it to the north, with
towns like Amid, Mayyafariqin [Martyropolis] and others too
numerous to mention. None of their kings resists Saladin, and
all are under his subjection, although they had been independent.
They remain by his grace, and if he wished, because he
walks in the way of God, he could remove them from their
possessions.
We had encamped outside the city to the east of it and by
the small river we have mentioned. We rested on Monday and
on Tuesday; and that day, after the midday prayers, we met
with Salmah Makshuf al-Ra's, whom we had failed to find
on Monday. We came upon him in his place of worship, and
saw a man of saintly aspect and devout manner, of a cheerful
and happy countenance, and kind and generous to meet. He
treated us sociably and prayed for us, after which we took our
leave and went our way, praising Great and Glorious God for
granting us the privilege of meeting His true saints and favoured
servants.
On the night of Wednesday the 9th of Rabi', after a measure
of sleep, we took to our saddles and rode until the morning,
when we alighted at an inhabited spot called Tell' Abdah. This
tell [mound] is high and broad like a table, and contains ancient
ruins. It has running water. We removed from it at sunset, and
journeyed throughout the night, passing a village called al-
Bayda which has a large new khan and is halfway between
Harran and the Euphrates. Facing it, and to the right of the
road, as you look over the Euphrates towards Syria, is the city
R
278 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of Saruj, whose story is made famous by al-Hariri in connection
with Abu Zayd. It has gardens and running waters as
described in his Maqamat ['Assemblies' or 'Seances'].
We reached the Euphrates in the morning and, crossing it
in well-found boats fitted for the passage, came on the other
side to a new-built fortress called Qal' at Najm. Around it are
the desert areas' (inhabited by the Bedouin), and it has a small
market containing necessities like fodder and bread. We stayed
there on Thursday the 10th of Rabi' al-Awwal, resting while
the caravan finished its crossing. When you cross the Euphrates,
you come within the confines of Syria and travel within the
dominion of Saladin until Damascus. The Euphrates is the boundary
between the regions of Syria and those of Rabi'ah and
Bakr. To the left of the road, as you look over the Euphrates
to Syria, is the city of al-Raqqah. Bordering it is the town of
Malik ibn Tawq known as Rahbat al-Sham and a famous city.
We moved on when the first third of the night had passed
and rode until we came to the city of Manbij with the morning
of Friday the n t h of Rabi', being the 22nd of June.
An account of the city of Manbij [Hierapolis]
May God protect it
It is a town of wide extent, and healthy of air. It is encompassed
by ancient walls of great length. Its skies are bright, its
aspect handsome, its breezes fragrant and perfumed, and while
its day gives generous shade, its night is all enchantment. East
and west, gardens thick with trees and divers fruits enfold the
town. Water flows freely through it and enters all its parts;
and God has favoured it with wells within that are sweeter
than honey and delicious to taste. Each house has a well, or
even two, and the earth is generous, throwing forth springs
of water everywhere. Its markets and streets are broad and
spacious, and its shops and booths are like khans and warehouses
in size and grandness. The highest of its markets are
roofed, and indeed the markets of most of the cities of these
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 279
regions are of this style. But a lengthy time is on the heels of
this town, and ruin has seized it. It had been one of the ancient
cities of the Rum, and the remains of their buildings there
attest their great attention to it. To the north it has a strong
fort, but it is separate from the city and remote. All the towns
of these regions have one of the Sultan's forts. The population
of Manbij is virtuous and worthy, and they are Sunnis [orthodox]
of the Shafi'ite rite, so that through them the town is
undefiled by those dissident sects and corrupt beliefs that are
found in most of this country. They are upright in their transactions
and straightforward in their affairs, and the clear path
of their religion is safe from the contradictions of schism. We
encamped outside the city in one of its gardens, and stayed
there resting a day. We departed from it at midnight, and
arrived at Buza'ah in the forenoon of Saturday the 12th
ofRabi'.
An account of the town of Buza'ah
May Great and Glorious God watch over it
Standing in a plain of fertile ground and of broad extent, it
is smaller than a city, and larger than a village. It has a market
where are found both the appurtenances of travel, and the
merchandise of a city. At its higher part there is a large and
powerful fortress. In ancient times, a king, while seeking to
capture it, had become enraged by its stubbornness, and so had
ordered the destruction of its walls and had left it, weak and
abandoned, in the desert. The town has a surface spring whose
waters flow through a broad valley with gardens radiant with
verdure and vegetation; and in its elegant splendour, it reveals
the beauty of a capital. Facing it, on the side of the valley, is
a large village called al-Bab [the Gate] that is the gate between
Buza'ah and Aleppo. Eight years ago, it was inhabited by some
Isma'iliyah heretics, whose number only God could count. The
sparks of their malevolence flew, and their mischief and wrongdoing
stopped this road, so that fury possessed the (other)
280 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
peoples of these regions who, moved by scorn and anger, collected
against them from all sides, putting them to the edge
of their swords and exterminating them to the last man. Their
roots [last remaining people] they made speed to destroy and
in this valley they piled high their skulls. God was sufficient
defence to the Muslims against their enmity and evil, and
caused their deceits to fall upon their own heads. Praise be to
God Lord of the Universe. The inhabitants of al-Bab are now
Sunnis.
We passed Saturday reposing in the valley of the city, but
moved from it at night and, faring until morn, came to the
city of Aleppo in the forenoon of Sunday the 13 th of Rabi'
al-Awwal, being the 24th of June.
An account of the city of Aleppo
May God Most High protect it
Aleppo is a town of eminent consequence, and in all ages
its fame has flown high. The kings who have sought its hand
in marriage are many, and its place in our souls is dear. How
many battles has it provoked, and how many white blades
have been drawn against it? Its fortress is renowned for its
impregnability and, from far distance seen for its great height,
is without like or match among castles. Because of its great
strength, an assailant who wills it or feels he can seize it must
turn aside. It is a massy pile, like a round table rising from the
ground, with sides of hewn stone and erected with true and
symmetrical proportions. Glory to Him who planned its design
and arrangement, and conceived its shape and outline.
The town is as old as eternity, yet new although it has never
ceased to be. Its days and years have been long, and the leaders
and the commons have said their last farewell. These are the
homes and abodes; but where are their ancient dwellers and
those that came to them? Those are the palaces and courts,
but where are the Hamdanid113 princes and their poets? All
have passed away, but the time of this city is not yet. Oh city
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 281
of wonder! It stays but its kings depart; they perish, but its
ruin is not yet decreed. Others after them have betrothed her,
and to contract her in marriage is not hard. She is desired and
it is with ease that she is possessed. This is Aleppo. How often
have its kings taken the predicate 'was', and the adverb of time
[the time of their rule] been erased while the adverb of place
[their capital] (remained). Her name was put in the feminine,
and she was decked in the ornaments of a chaste maiden, while
(woman-like) upon the treacherous she practised deceit. She
was adorned as a bride for the Sword of her State [Sayf al-
Dawlah] ibn Hamdan. Alas! Alas! her youth will not endure,
suitors she will lack, and after a time ruin will hasten upon her,
and the vanguard of misfortune will draw near to her, until
'God has inherited the earth and all upon it' [Koran XIX, 40].
There is no God but He. Glory to Him, splendid is His power.
But talk has led us from our purpose: we return now to what
we were about.
We say that amongst the honours of this castle is that, as
we were told, it was in early days a hill whither Abraham the
Friend (of God) - may God's blessings and protection enfold
him and our Prophet-was wont to repair with some flocks
he had, and there milk them and dispense the milk as alms.
The place was therefore called Halab [Ar., 'milk'. Aleppo is,
of course, the Western version of Halab]. God best knows
concerning this. In the fortress is a venerated shrine, dedicated
to him, which men visit to win blessings by praying therein.
Amongst its perfect qualities, and a necessity in the defence of
fortresses, is that water springs up within it. Two cisterns have
been built over the water and they discharge water throughout
the year, so never is there fear of thirst. Food also will
keep there for all time without impairment. In all the conditions
of defence there are no more important and certain than
these two attributes. Round the two cisterns, on the side facing
the town, is a strong double wall, at the foot of which lies
a ditch, whose bottom the eye cannot reach, where water
springs. The state of this fortress, both as regards its strength
282 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and its beauty, is grander than we can reach in description.
Its upper wall is all towers, well-disposed, with dominating
high-points and commanding galleries, throughout opened with
loopholes. Each tower is garrisoned, and inside the fortress
are the suites of the Sultan and apartments for the royal
dignitaries.
As for the town, it is massively built and wonderfully disposed,
and of rare beauty, with large markets arranged in long
adjacent rows so that you pass from a row of shops of one
craft into that of another until you have gone through all the
urban industries. These markets are all roofed with wood, so
that their occupants enjoy an ample shade, and all hold the
gaze from their beauty, and halt in wonder those who are
hurrying by. Its qaysariyyah is as a walled-in garden in its
freshness and beauty, flanked, as it is, by the venerated mosque.
He who sits in it yearns for no other sight even were it paradisaical.
Most of the shops are in wooden warehouses of excellent
workmanship, a row being formed of one warehouse
divided by wooden railings richly carved that all open on
(separate) shops. The result is most beautiful. Each row is
connected with one of the gates of the venerated mosque.
This is one of the finest and most beautiful of mosques. Its
great court is surrounded by large and spacious porticoes that
are full of doors, beautiful as those of a palace, that open on
to the court. Their number is more than fifty, and they hold
the gaze from their fine aspect. In the court there are two wells
fed by springs. The south portico has no maqsurah, so that its
amplitude is manifest and most pleasing to look upon. The art
of ornamental carving had exhausted itself in its endeavours
on the pulpit, for never in any city have I seen a pulpit like it
or of such wondrous workmanship. The woodwork stretches
from it to the mihrab, beautifully adorning all its sides in the
same marvellous fashion. It rises up, like a great crown, over
the mihrab, and then climbs until it reaches the heights of the
roof. The upper part of the mosque is in the form of an arch,
furnished with wooden merlons, superbly carved and all inlaid
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 283
with ivory and ebony. This marquetry extends from the pulpit
to the mihrab and to that part of the south wall which they
adjoin without any interval appearing; and the eyes consider
the most beautiful sight in the world. The splendour of this
venerated mosque is greater than can be described.
At its west side stands a Hanafite college which resembles
the mosque in beauty and perfection of work. Indeed in beauty
they are like one mausoleum beside another. This school is one
of the most ornamental we have seen, both in construction and
in its rare workmanship. One of the most graceful things we
saw was the south side, filled with chambers and upper rooms,
whose windows touched each other, and having, along its
length, a pergola covered with grape-bearing vines. Each window
had its moiety of the grapes that hung before it, and each
occupant could, by leaning forward, stretch forth his arm and
pluck the fruit without pain or trouble.
Besides this college the city has four or five others, and a
hospital. Its state of splendour is superb, and it is a city fit to
be (the seat of) the Caliph. But its magnificence is all within,
and it has nought without save a small river [al-Quwayq] that
flows from north to south and passes through the suburb that
surrounds the city; for it has a large suburb containing numerable
khans. On this river there are mills contiguous with the
town, and in the middle of the suburb are gardens that stretch
along its length. But whatever may be its state, inside or out,
Aleppo is one of the cities of the world that have no like, and
that would take long to describe. We lodged in its suburb,
in a khan called the Khan of Abu 1-Shukr, where we stayed
four days.
We departed on the morning of Thursday the 17th of Rabi',
the 28th of June, and a little before the late afternoon, came
to Qinnasrin where we rested awhile. We then moved to a
village called Tell Tajir, where we passed the night of Friday
the 18th. Qinnasrin is a town famous in time, but it has fallen
to ruin, and has become as if it never had a yesterday, nothing
284 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
enduring but its fading remains and its disappearing traces. But
its villages are populated and well arranged, for they stand
amongst a large tillage that stretches broad and long before
the eyes. One of the towns of Andalusia that resembles it is
Jaen, and so it is related that at the time of the conquest of
Spain (by the Arabs), the people of Qirmasrin settled in Jaen
feeling at home in its resemblance to their native town and
addressing themselves to it, as was done in most of that land
as is known.
We departed when a third of the night had passed, and rode
until after sunrise when we halted to rest at a place called
Baqidin in a large khan, strongly fortified, called the Khan of
the Turcomans. The khans on this road are like fortresses in
their unassailableness and their fortifications. Their doors are
of iron, and they present the utmost strength. We left this
place and passed the night at a place called Tamanni in a khan
strong in the manner already described. We bent our way at
dawn on Saturday the 19th of Rabi' al-Awwal, which was the
last day of June. On the Friday we had seen, to the right of
the road and two parasangs away, the lands of al-Ma'arrah.
They are all dark with olive, fig, and pistachio trees, and all
kinds of fruits; and their luxuriant gardens and well-ordered
villages stretch for a distance of two days'journeying. It is one
of the most fertile and productive regions in Islamic lands.
Beyond them are the Mountains of Lebanon, of towering
height and great length, extending along the sea coast. On
their slopes are castles belonging to the heretical Isma'ilites,
a sect which swerved from Islam and vested divinity in a man.
Their prophet was a devil in man's disguise called Sinan, who
deceived them with falsehoods and chimeras embellished for
them to act upon. He bewitched them with these black arts,
so that they took him as a god and worshipped him. They
abased themselves before him, reaching such a state of obedience
and subjection that did he order one of them to fall from
the mountain top he would do so, and with alacrity that he
might be pleased. God in His power allows to stray those
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 285
whom He wills, and guides whom He wishes. Glory to
Him to whom we turn for protection from seducement
in religion, asking His protection from the straying of the
heretics. There is no Lord but He, and only He should be
worshipped. [See note 43. These heretics are the Assassins.]
Mount Lebanon is the frontier between Muslim lands and
those of the Franks, for beyond it he Antioch, Latakia, and
others of their cities - may God restore them to die Muslims.
On the slopes of this mountain is a fortress called Hisn al-
Akrad [the fortress of the Kurds]. It belongs to the Franks,
and from it they make raids on Hamah and Hims [Horns or
Emessa] whence it can be seen. We arrived at the city of Hamah
in the high forenoon of Saturday and lodged in one of die
khans in its suburb.
An account of the city of Hamah [Epiphania]
May God Most High defend it
It is a city renowned through the lands, and long a companion
of time. It is not of wide extent, nor is it finely built,
its quarters are clustered together and its houses piled up, so
that the eyes are not cheered in looking down upon it. It is
as if she would veil and hide her glory, for you will find her
beauty concealed until you have spied out her inmost parts
and scrutinised her shades.
To the east of the city I saw a large river [the Orontes] that
in its strong course spreads out and branches, and on its banks
observed water-wheels that faced each other. Along these banks
are disposed gardens that hang their branches over the water,
the green leaves appearing like down on its cheeks as it flows
through their shade, gliding through the line of their symmetry.
On the bank that borders the suburb of the city is a
place of ablution, furnished with many rooms and with water
coming to all its parts from one of the water-wheels. In it the
bather will find no trace of defilement. On the other bank, the
one adjoining the lower city, is a small mosque whose eastern
286 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
wall is pierced with windows from which one looks upon a
view that soothes the soul, and holds the gaze enchanted.
Beside the river's course, to the north of the city, is a fortress
like that of Aleppo in construction, although inferior to it in
strength and impregnability. Water comes to it from the river
by means of conduits, and rises within it, so there is no fear
of thirst, nor need to dread the designs of the enemy.
Hamah lies in a depression, wide and long like a deep trench,
with high sides. One is like an o'ertopping mountain, with the
upper city touching the slopes of that mountainous side. On
the other side the fortress stands on a large, round, and isolated
hill. Time undertook its construction, and, from its strength,
safety from the enemy has been its lot. The lower city is below
the fortress and is conterminous with the side on which the
river flows. Both cities are small. The wall of the upper city
reaches to the tip of its higher side on the mountain and surrounds
it. The lower city has a wall that encompasses it on
three sides; for the side contiguous with the river does not need
a wall. Over the river is a bridge built of hard stone that extends
from the lower city to its suburb. This is a large suburb with
khans and houses, and it has shops where the traveller, until
such time as he is free to enter the city, may buy the things he
stands in need of.
The markets of the upper city are more crowded and handsome
than those of the lower, and they include all the products
of industry and trade. They are laid out with excellent order,
and are surpassingly well organised and divided. Its cathedral
mosque is larger than that of the lower city, and it has three
colleges and a hospital on the river bank beside the small
mosque. Outside this city is a large and extensive plain, mostly
composed of vines, but having tilled and sown land, and the
sight of it rejoices and enlarges the soul. The gardens are continuous
along the banks of the river, which is called al-'Asi
[The Rebellious], because it seems to flow from below upwards,
its course being from south to north.114 It passes to the south
of Hims [Emessa] and near to it.
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AWWAL (580) 287
We stayed in Hamah until the evening of Saturday, when
we left it and fared throughout the night. We crossed the river
al-'Asi [Orontes] at midnight by a large bridge built of stone.
On this river is the city of Rastan [Arethusa] which was
destroyed by 'Umar ibn al-Khattab - may God hold him in
His favour. Its ruins are impressive. The Rum of Constantinople
say that it contains a great buried treasure, but God best knows
of that.
We came to Hims at sunset on Sunday the 20th of Rabi'
(al-Awwal), the 1st of July, and lodged outside it in a roadside
khan.
An account of the city of Hims [Emessa]
May God Most High protect it
It is of broad extent and of oblong dimensions. Its spectacle
is a refreshment to the eyes because of its grace and beauty.
It stands in a plain of wide expanse, across which blows no
gentle breeze, and whose limits the eye can scarcely reach;
a vast, dusty plain without water or trees, or shade or fruit.
The city complains of thirst, and brings its water from afar,
for it comes by a canal from the river al-'Asi [Orontes] which
is about a mile away. On the banks of the river is a strip of
gardens, upon whose verdure the eye may dwell, marvelling
at its luxuriance. The 'Asi rises in a cave on the slopes of a
mountain that overtops the city a stage distant, and faces Ba'labakk
[Baalbek or Heliopolis] - may God restore it (to the
Muslims).
Hims is on the right of the road to Damascus. Its inhabitants
are renowned for their courage and their relentless struggles
against the enemies who surround them. In this the people of
Aleppo come after them. The most praiseful things of this
town are its fresh air and its happy breezes which are ethereal
but yet make a stout body; for in salubrity it is the brother
and partner of the air of Nejd. To the south of the city is a
powerful and impregnable castle, stubborn and implacable, and
288 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
because of its position, separate and detached from it. To its
east is a cemetery containing the tomb of Khahd ibn al-Walid
- may God hold him in His favour - who was God's drawn
sword, and of his son 'Abd al-Rahman and of 'Ubayd Allah
son of (the Caliph) 'Umar - may God hold them in His favour.
The walls of this city are of the oldest antiquity and the greatest
strength, being built of hard black stone compactly laid. Its
iron gates are of towering height, awesome to look upon, and
fearful in their beetling disdain. It is surrounded by soaring
towers, well fortified. But inside you may conceive it to be
a disordered wilderness, with shabby environs and patchedup
buildings, the sun never shining on its horizons, and
having no brightness in its markets, unthriving and without
bond.
What think you of a town that is only a few miles from
Hisn al-Akrad [the Fortress of the Kurds], the stronghold of
the enemy where you can see their fires whose sparks burn
you when they fly, and whence each day, should they wish,
the enemy may raid you on horseback? We asked one of the
sheiks of the town whether there was a hospital in it after
the style of the cities of these parts. He first said that there
was not, and then added: 'Hims is all a hospital, and proof
enough of it is the evidence of its people.' The city has one
college.
When you look upon it from a distance you will find in
its plain, in its vista, and in the form of its design, some resemblance
to the city of Ishbiliyyah [Siviglia] in Andalusia; an
image which suddenly falls to your mind. Indeed by this name
(of Hims) Siviglia was known of old. It was because of this
reason that the Bedouin of Hims settled in Siviglia as is related.
And although the resemblance is not complete, there is a
suggestion of it from one side.
We tarried in Hims that Sunday and until the early noon
of the Monday that followed, which was the 2nd of July, when
we removed. Our march we continued until evening, when
THE MONTH OF RABI AL-AWWAL (580) 289
we alighted at a ruined village called al-Mash'ar, where we
fed our beasts. At sunset we set forward and journeyed all
night and on until the sun was high on the morning of Tuesday,
the 22nd of the month (of Rabi' al-Awwal), when we
halted at a large village called al-Qarah, which belongs to
Christians who dwell there under treaty and in which there
are no Muslims. It has a large khan, like a towering fortress,
which has in its centre a big cistern filled with water that comes
to it in underground conduits from a distant spring. It is always
full. We rested in this khan until noon, when we left it for a
village called al-Nabk, where there is running water and a broad
tillage, and there we dismounted for the evening meal. After
seizing a little slumber, we bent our way and journeyed throughout
the night, coming in the morning to the Khan of the Sultan,
which was built by Saladin, the Lord of Syria. It is the zenith
of strength and handsomeness, with iron doors after their fashion
in the building of khans on this road and in accordance with
the attention with which they fortify them. Inside the khan
is running water which flows through underground conduits
to a fountain in the middle. This is like a cistern, with
outlets through which the water pours into a small basin
that runs around it and then plunges into a conduit below
the ground. The road from Hims to Damascus is little populated,
except at the three or four places where there are these
khans.
Wednesday the 23 rd of Rabi' we stayed resting in this khan
and overtaking sleep until the beginning of noon, when we
departed. We passed through Thaniyyat al-'Uqab [the Eagles'
Pass], which overlooks the plain of Damascus and its Ghutah
[the name for the surroundings of Damascus]. At this pass the
road (from Damascus) divides in two, one branch being that
on which we had come, and the other going eastward into
the desert by al-Samawah to 'Iraq. This (latter) is the more
direct, but it can only be entered upon in wintertime. From
this pass, we descended the bed of a valley between the mountains
and came to a plain, where we alighted at a place called
290 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
al-Qusayr. It has a large khan, and the river (Orontes) flows
before it. We left it in the morning, and passing between continuous
gardens of beauty beyond description, came to Damascus
in the forenoon of Thursday the 24th of Rabi' al-Awwal,
the 5th of July. Praise be to God, Lord of the Universe.
The Month of Rabi1 al-Akhir (580)
[12th of July-9th of August, 1184]
THE new moon rose on Wednesday the n t h [12th] of July
when we were in Damascus, lodging in the Dar al-Hadith
[House of Religious Tradition] west of the venerated cathedral
mosque.
An account of the city of Damascus - may God Most High
protect it. She is the paradise of the Orient, the place
where dawned her gracious and radiant beauty, the seal
of the lands of Islam where we have sought hospitality,
and the bride of the cities we have observed. She is
garnished with the flowers of sweet-scented herbs, and
bedecked in the brocaded vestments of gardens. In the place
of beauty she holds a sure position, and on her nuptial
chair she is most richly adorned
Damascus was honoured when God Most High gave asylum
there to the Messiah and his mother - may God bless and preserve
them - 'on a hill having meadows and springs' [Koran
XXIII, 50] with deep shade and delicious water. Its rivulets
twist like serpents through every way, and the perfumed
zephyrs of its flower gardens breathe life to the soul. To those
who contemplate her she displays herself in her bridal dress
calling to them: 'Come to the halting place of beauty, and
take the midday repose.'
Its ground is sickened with the superfluity of water, so that
it yearns even for a drought, and the hard stones almost cry
out to you. 'Urge on (your horse) with your foot; here is a
cool cleansing place and a drink' [Koran XXXVIII, 42]. The
gardens encircle it like the halo round the moon and contain
it as it were the calyx of a flower. To the east, its green Ghutah
292 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
stretches as far as the eye can see, and wherever you look on
its four sides its ripe fruits hold the gaze. By Allah, they spoke
truth who said: 'If Paradise is on the earth then Damascus
without a doubt is in it. If it is in the sky, then it vies with
it and shares its glory.'
A description of her venerated Cathedral Mosque115
May God Most High prosper it
For beauty, perfection of construction, marvellous and sumptuous
embellishment and decoration, it is one of the most
celebrated mosques of the world. Its general fame in this regard
renders valueless a deep description. One of the strangest things
concerning it is that the spider never spins his web therein,
nor do swallows ever enter it or alight thereon. (The Caliph)
Al-Walid ibn 'Abd al-Malik [A.D. 705-15] - may God's mercy
rest upon his soul - undertook the construction of this mosque,
and sent to the king of the Rum at Constantinople ordering
him to send twelve thousand craftsmen from his country,
offering threats in case he should delay. But he obeyed submissively,
after an exchange of letters between them, even as
is recorded in the books of history. Walid commenced the construction
and the most exhaustive attention was given to it.
All its walls were inlaid with gold mosaic called fusayfisa [Gr.,
ypcpos]; and mingled with it were all kinds of remarkable
colours in the pattern of plants throwing out branches and
arranged amongst the gold stones with the most wonderful of
exquisite work, that it is impossible to describe, and that dazzles
the eyes with its brightness and lustre. The amount spent on
it, according to Ibn al-Mu'alh 'l-'Asadi in a chapter that he
wrote in description of its building, was four hundred coffers,
each coffer containing twenty-eight thousand dinars, giving a
total of eleven million and two hundred thousand dinars [above
five and a half million sterling].
It was Walid who took that half of the church which
remained in the hands of the Christians and embraced it in
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (s8o) 293
the mosque. For it had been in two parts, the eastern belonging
to the Muslims and the western to the Christians. This was
because Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah - may God hold him in
His favour - had entered the town from the west and arrived
at the centre of the church after he had already made peace
with the Christians. But Khalid ibn al-Walid - may God hold
him in His favour - had entered by assault from the east side
of the town, and had arrived to take the eastern half of the
church. So the Muslims took possession of this eastern half and
made of it a mosque, while the half which came under the
treaty of capitulation, that is the western half, remained a church
in the hands of the Christians,116 until (the Caliph) Walid asked
them, for it in return for compensation. They refused, whereupon
he seized it from them by force, and himself began its
destruction. The Christians asserted that whosoever should
destroy it would be stricken mad, but Walid replied at once,
'I shall be the first to go mad in the service of God,' and with
his own hands began to tear it down. The Muslims made speed
to complete its destruction. The Christians had sought the protection
of 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz - may God hold him in
His favour - at the time of his Caliphate [A.D. 634-44] and had
brought forward the pact which they had received from the
Companions (of the Prophet) - may God hold them in His
favour - allowing it to remain to them. He proposed to give
it back to them, but the Muslims were disquieted at this, so
he compensated the Christians with a great sum which satisfied
them and which they accepted.
It is related that the first to lay his hand to the foundation
of the qiblah wall was the prophet Hud - upon whom be
(eternal) happiness - and so it is recounted by Ibn al-Mu'alli
in his chronicle. God best knows of this. There is no God
but He. We read in the book Fadail Dimashq [The Merits of
Damascus] that Sufyan al-Thawri - may God hold him in His
favour - declared that one prayer in this mosque is worth thirty
thousand (elsewhere). And in the traditions of the Prophet -
may God bless and preserve him - (it is said) that Great and
s
294 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
Glorious God will continue to be worshipped in it for forty
years after the destruction of the world.
A note on the dimensions and size of the Mosque, and
the number of its doors and ivindows
Its measurement in length, from east to west, is two hundred
paces, which is equivalent to three hundred cubits; and its
measurement in width from south to north is one hundred and
thirty-five paces, which is equivalent to two hundred cubits.
Its area in the Maghribi marja' [50 square cubits] is twentyfour
maraja', which is the same area as that of the mosque of
God's Prophet-may God bless and preserve him - (in Medina),
except that lengthways the latter extends from south to north.
The aisles along the south side are three in number and stretch
from east to west, and the breadth of each aisle is eighteen
paces, a pace being a cubit and a half.
The aisles are raised on sixty-eight supports: fifty-four of
these are pillars, eight are stucco pilasters interspersed between
the pillars, two are marble-covered pilasters set with them into
the wall that adjoins the court, and four are piers that are
covered with marble in a most beautiful fashion, being studded
with coloured marble mosaics arranged in rings, and illustrated
with mihrabs and rare designs. These latter stand in the central
aisle and uphold the Lead Dome together with the dome that
is beside the mihrab. The width of each pier is sixteen spans,
and the length twenty. Between each pier and the other, lengthwise,
he seventeen paces, and laterally thirteen. The perimeter of
each pier is seventy-two spans.
A colonnade ten paces wide runs round the court on three
sides, the east, the west, and the north. It has forty-seven supports,
fourteen being stucco pilasters, and the remainder pillars.
The breadth of the court, exclusive of the covered parts south
and north, is one hundred cubits. The whole of the exterior
of the mosque's roof is covered with lead slates.
The most impressive thing in this blessed mosque is the Lead
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) 295
Dome in the centre of the building beside the mihrab. It rises
high into the air with a vast circumference, and is supported
by the huge erection which is the nave and which extends from
the mihrab to the court. Over this nave are three cupolas, one
adjoining the wall against the court, one beside the mihrab,
and the other beneath (and within) the Lead Dome and between
the other two. The Lead Dome chokes the air around it, and
when you come before it you look upon an overwhelming
sight, an awe-inspiring spectacle which men have likened to
an eagle in flight, the Dome being its head, the nave its breast,
and die half of the wall of the right aisle together with the
half of that on the left, its wings. The width of this nave that
leads towards the court, is thirty paces. Men call this part of
the mosque al-Nasr [the Eagle] for this resemblance to it.
From whatever direction you look upon Damascus, you will
see the Dome towering in the air over all other eminences as
though it were suspended in space. The blessed mosque is
situated towards the north of the city.
The number of gilt and stained-glass windows is seventyfour.
In the cupola beneath the Lead Dome are ten; in the
cupola adjoining the mihrab and in the adjacent wall, fourteen;
along the length of the wall right and left of the mihrab, fortyfour;
in the cupola adjoining the wall on the court, six; and
on the outside of the wall towards the court, forty-seven.
The blessed mosque has three maqsurahs. One is the Maqsurah
of the Companions - may God hold them in His favour
-which was the first maqsurah ever built in Islam. It was
erected by (the Caliph) Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan-may
God hold them in His favour. Beside its mihrab, to the right
of him who looks to the qiblah [direction of Mecca], is the
Iron Gate by which Mu'awiyah used to enter the maqsurah
and come to the mihrab. (Also) beside this mihrab, to the right,
is the oratory of Abu '1-Darda' [the Toothless] - may God
hold him in His favour - and behind it was the palace of
Mu'awiyah - may God hold him in His favour. To-day it is
the great Coppersmiths' Row, and it runs along the south wall
296 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
of the mosque. There is no more beautiful-looking row of
shops than this, nor bigger both in length and breadth. Behind
it and close by is the cavalry barrack of Mu'awiyah which
to-day is tenanted, and in which the cloth-fullers have a place.
The length of the Maqsurah of the Companions is fortyfour
spans, and its breadth is half the length. Close by it, to
the west and in the centre of the mosque, is the maqsurah
that was built at the time that the part used as a church was
added to the mosque, as we have already related. It has a
pulpit for the khutbah and a mihrab for the prayers. The
Maqsurah of the Companions had originally been in the middle
of the Muslim part of the church and the wall (of separation)
had been in the place where the mihrab was installed in the
New Maqsurah. "When all the church became a mosque, the
Maqsurah of the Companions came to be on one side in the
eastern part, and the other maqsurah was built in the middle
where had stood the (separating) wall of the mosque before
the incorporation (of the Christian half of the church). This
New Maqsurah is bigger than that of the Companions. In the
west side, by the wall, is another maqsurah belonging to the
Hanafites, and here they assemble for study and prayer. Adjoining
it is a zawiyah girdled by wooden lattices and forming a
sort of small maqsurah. On the east side there is another zawiyah
of the same pattern, (also) like a maqsurah. It was installed for
praying in by one of the Turkish Emirs of the State, and is
joined to the east wall.
In the blessed mosque there are many zawiyahs of this type,
used by students for copying (the Koran) and for study and
for withdrawal from the press of men; and they are amongst
the advantages provided for students. In the wall abutting on
the court and enclosed by the south colonnade there are,
throughout its length, twenty doors surmounted by stuccoed
arches, the whole with hollowed mouldings in the form of
windows; and in their unbroken continuity the eyes perceive
the most beautiful and graceful spectacle. As to the colonnades
that enclose the'court from (the other) three sides, they are
THE MONTH OF RABI AL-AKHIR (580) 297
supported by columns over which are arched embrasures sustained
by smaller columns that go round the whole of the
court. This court is one of the most beautiful and splendid of
sights. Here the population congregate, for it is their place of
care-dispelling and recreation, and here every evening you will
see them, coming and going from east to west, from Bab
Jairun to Bab al-Barid [the Gate of the Mail-post], and others
you will see talking to their friends, and some reading. In this
manner they will go on, coming and going, until the end of
the last evening prayers, and then depart. Some do this in the
morning, but the largest assembly is in the evening, and he
who surveys it will conceive it to be the night of the 27th of
Ramadan the venerated for what he will observe of the multitude
of people congregating together. They do not cease from
doing this every day. The idle ones among men call them
'ploughmen'.
The mosque has three minarets. One on the west side is like
a lofty tower with large apartments and spacious chapels, all
leading to large doors and lived in by strangers of pious mode
of life. The topmost chamber was where Abu Hamid al-
Ghazali - may God hold him in His favour - prayed in seclusion,
and to-day it is inhabited by the jurisprudent and ascetic
Abu 'Abdallah ibn Sa'id of the family of Qal'at Yahsub, (the
name of their native town in Spain) from which they take
their name. He is related to the Banu Sa'id who are illustrious
for their services to the world. The second minaret is on the
west117 side after the same style, and the third is on the north
at the Gate known as the Bab al-Natifiyin [the Gate of the
Sweetmeat Sellers].
In the court there are three domes. The largest is on the
west side and is supported by eight marble columns, is tall like
a tower, ornamented with many coloured mosaics, and like a
flower garden in beauty. It is capped by a lead cupola like a
large round oven-rtop. It is said that it was the treasury for
the riches of the mosque, which has a large income from its
rents and the sale of crops, exceeding, as we were told, eight
298 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
thousand Tyre dinars [£4,000] a year, which is fifteen thousand
mu'mini dinars or thereabouts.118 Another smaller dome stands
in the middle of the court. It is hollow and octagonal and built
of marble blocks joined in remarkable fashion, and supported
by four small columns of marble. In its lower part it has a
round iron grating, in the middle of which is a copper spout
which throws out water that rises high and then bends down,
so that it is like a silver wand. Men are avid to put their mouths
under it to drink, finding it pleasant and good. They call it
the Water Cage. The third dome is on the east side raised
on eight columns in the manner of the large dome, but
smaller.
On the north side of the court is a massive gateway giving
on to a large mosque. In the middle of this is a court with a
large round marble basin into which water continuously plays
from a white, octagonal, marble bowl set in the middle of the
basin on the top of a tubed column up which the water rises.
This place is called al-Kallasah [the Lime-Kiln],119 and there
to-day prays our companion, the jurisprudent, ascetic, and
traditionalist Abu Ja'far al-Fanaki of Cordova. In great numbers
men come to follow him in prayers, to receive his benedictions,
and to hear his fine voice.
On the east side of the court is a gateway which gives access
to one of the most beautiful of mosques, of the most excellent
planning and the most elegant construction. The Shi'ites declare
that it is the shrine of 'AH ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him
in His favour - which is one of their more remarkable fabrications.
A thing of note is that facing this mosque, on the west
side of the court, in the corner where the end of the north
colonnade meets the beginning of the west colonnade, is a
place whose upper part is covered with a veil and in front of
which hangs a curtain. Most men say that it is the place where
dwelt 'A'ishah - may God hold her in His favour - and that
there she related the traditions. The entry into Damascus of
'A'ishah-may God hold her in His favour - l i k e that of
'Ali - may God hold him in His favour - (is disputable),
THE MONTH OF RABI AL-AKHIR (580) 299
although in the case of 'AH - may God hold him in His favour
-they have in excuse a legend in which they relate that he
was seen in a dream praying there. The Shi'ites accordingly
built a mosque in this place. But as for the place connected
with 'A'ishah - may God hold her in His favour - there is no
authority attached to it. We but mention this because of its
notoriety in the mosque.
The blessed cathedral mosque, both inside and out, is inlaid
with gilded mosaics, is embellished with the most superb
architectural ornament, and is miraculously executed. Twice
it suffered fire and was destroyed and twice rebuilt. Most of
its marble went, and its splendour changed. The parts best
preserved to-day are the qiblah side and the three cupolas
alongside it. Its mihrab is the most wonderful in Islam for
its beauty and rare art, and the whole of it gleams with gold.
Within it are small mihrabs adjoining its wall and surrounded
by small columns, voluted like a bracelet as if done by a turner,
than which nothing more beautiful could be seen, some of
them being red as coral. The glory of the qiblah of this blessed
mosque and the three cupolas adjoining it, irradiated by the
gilded and coloured windows whose every colour is reflected
on the qiblah wall as the rays of the sun pour through them,
is such as to dazzle the eyes. It is all so grand as to beggar
description, and words cannot express a part of what the mind
can picture. May God by His favour long preserve it for the
profession of the faith of Islam and of His word.
In the east corner of the New Maqsurah, inside the mihrab,
is a large cupboard containing one of the Korans of (the Caliph)
'Uthman-may God hold him in His favour. It is the copy
(of the definitive recension) which he sent to Syria.120 This
cupboard is opened daily after the prayers, and people seek
God's blessing by touching and kissing the Book; and the press
around it is very great.
The mosque has four portals. The south door is called Bab
al-Ziyadah [Door of Increase], and opens on to a large and
spacious vestibule, with immense pillars, where the bead-sellers
300 THE TRAVELS OF IBN
and others have shops. It is an impressive sight. From it the
way leads to the cavalry barrack, and to the left as you leave
is the Coppersmiths' Row which has been the palace of (the
Caliph) Mu'awiyah - may God hold him in His favour - bearing
the name al-Khadra' [the Green (Palace)]. The east door
is the biggest of them and is called Bab Jayrun. The west door
is known as Bab al-Barid [Door of the Mail-post], and the
north door is called Bab al-Natifiyyin [Door of the Sweetmeatsellers].
At the east, west, and north doors there are also huge
vestibules all having great doors that were entrances to the
(Christian Church) and which remain in their former state.
The most imposing to look upon is the vestibule connected
with the Bab Jayrun. Going forth from this door, one comes
to a long and broad portico at the front of which are five
arched doorways with six tall columns. To the left is a large
and splendid shrine where the head of Al-Husayn ibn 'Ah -
may God hold them both in His favour - was kept until it
was moved to Cairo. Beside it is a small mosque called after
(the Caliph) 'Umar ibn Abd al-'Aziz - may God hold him in
His favour. In the shrine itself is running water.
In front of the portico are steps whereby descent is made to
the vestibule, which is like a vast ditch ending in a door of
immense height, whose summit the gaze falls short of. Flanking
the door are pillars that are like palm-trees in height and
mountains in size. Along both sides of this vestibule are columns
that sustain circular galleries ranged with perfumers' and other
shops; and still above these are other long galleries with rooms
and apartments for hire that look down on the vestibule. They
are covered by a flat roof where the tenants of these rooms and
apartments pass the night. In the centre of the vestibule is a
large round marble basin over which is an (open-topped) dome
sustained by marble columns and with a deep lead band around
its upper part. It is exposed to the elements for no upper vault
bends over it. In the centre of the marble basin is a brass spout
which throws out water with much force, so that it rises into
the air more than a man's height and no * * * *. Around this
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) 301
spout are other smaller ones that hurl high the water which
issues from them like silver wands or like branches of that tree
of water. The spectacle is more wonderful and delightful to
see than can be described.
To the right of him who leaves by the Bab Jayrun, in the
wall of the portico in front of him, is a gallery in the form of
a large archway set with yellow arches in each of which opens
a small door to the number of the hours of the day. An engineering
contrivance has been arranged whereby at the end of
each hour of the day two brass balls fall each from the mouths
of two brazen falcons set above two brass cups, one below
each bird. One falcon is beneath the first door, and the other
beneath the last (and twelfth). The cups are perforated so that
when the balls fall into them, they return through the inside
of the wall to the gallery. You may see the two falcons stretching
forth their necks with the balls (in their mouths) towards
the cups, and throwing them down sharply with splendid precision,
so that the imagination might conceive it to be a piece
of sorcery. When the balls fall into the cups, a noise is heard
from them, and the yellow door corresponding to that hour
closes upon the instant. Thus it happens as each hour of the
day comes to a close, until all the doors are shut and the (twelve)
hours are ended, when the process returns again to the beginning.
At night there is another arrangement. In the archway
that bends over these (twelve small) arches are twelve perforated
brass discs at each of which, inside the wall of the
gallery, is set a plate of glass. All this is arranged behind the
(hour) arches mentioned above. Behind each glass is a lamp
which is turned by water on an hourly system, so that when
an hour has passed the light from the lamp illumines the glass
and throws its rays upon the disc in front of it, making it appear
to the eyes as a red circlet. The lamp then changes on to another
disc until the hours of the night are ended and all the discs
have been reddened. Inside the gallery is a person trained in
its management, who is charged with supervising the movement,
reopening the doors and returning the balls to their
302 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
places. It is what men call the water-clock [manjanah=Gr.
pocyyocvov].
In the vestibule at the West door are the greengrocers' and
perfumers' shops, and it has a row of fruit-shops. At its upper
end is a massive door to which one climbs by a flight of steps.
It has columns soaring into the sky. At the foot of the steps
are two round fountains, one to the right and the other to the
left, which both have five spouts pouring water into a long
marble trough. In the vestibule at the north door are zawiyahs
on platforms and enclosed by wooden balustrades, where
teachers instruct children. To the right of him who leaves,
inside the vestibule, is a convent built for the Sufis, with a
cistern in its middle. It is said that it had been the house of
'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz - may God hold him in His favour -
and there is a story to it which we shall presently relate. This
cistern has running water in it, and there are ablution places to
whose cubicles the water flows. Also to the right of him who
leaves the Bab al-Barid is a Shafi'ite college which has in its
centre a cistern of running water, and ablution places of the
style described.
In the court (of the Great Mosque) between the domes we
have mentioned, are two columns that stand a little apart from
each other. Their capitals are deep and of brass, fretted and
beautifully engraved, and on the middle night of (the month
of) Sha'ban they are hung with lamps so that they appear as
lighted chandeliers. The people of this town gather together
on this night more than they do on the night of the twentyseventh
(and last day) of the venerated (fasting-month of)
Ramadan.
In this venerated mosque, after the morning prayers, there
daily assembles a great congregation for the reading of one of
the seven sections of the Koran. This is unfailing, and it is the
same after the evening prayers for the reading of what is called
the Kawthariyah [The Abundance of God], when they read
from the surah al-Kawthar [Koran CVIII] until the end of the
book. To this assembly of the Kawthar come all who do not
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) ^
well know the Koran by heart; and all such participants receive
a daily allowance, more than five hundred persons being able
to live from it. This is one of the virtues of this venerated
mosque, in which from morn till eve the Koran is read unceasingly.
In it lectures are delivered to students, and the teachers
receive a liberal stipend. The Malikites have a zawiyah for study
in the west side, and there the students from the Maghrib, who
receive a fixed allowance, assemble. The conveniences of this
venerated mosque for strangers and students are indeed many
and wide.
The strangest thing to tell of this mosque concerns the column
which stands between the old and the new maqsurahs. It has
a fixed waqf [endowment] for the benefit of those who lean
against it in meditation or study. We saw beside it a jurisprudent
from Seville, called al-Muradi. In the morning, at the
end of the assembly for the reading of a seventh section of the
Koran, each man leans against a column, while in front of him
sits a boy who instructs him in the Koran. The boys also have
a fixed allowance for their reciting, but those of their fathers
who are affluent prohibit their sons from accepting it, although
the remainder do so. This is one of the virtues of Islam.
For orphan boys, there is in the town a large school with a
generous* endowment from which the teachers draw enough
to sustain themselves, and disembursements are made from it
to support and clothe the children. This also is one of the
uncommon things to tell of the virtues of these lands. The
instruction of boys in the Koran in all these eastern lands consists
only of making them commit to memory, writing they
learn through the medium of poetry and other things. The
Book of Great and Glorious God is thus kept undefiled from
the markings and rubbings out of the boys' efforts. In most
(of these) lands the Koran teacher and writing master are
separate persons, and from his lesson in Koran reading the
student is dismissed to his calligraphy. In this they follow an
excellent method, which produces a good hand, for the instructor
in that subject is occupied with no other, and while he puts
304 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
all his efforts into the teaching of it, the pupil does the same in
learning it; and finds it easy for he faithfully copies his preceptor.
Round this venerated mosque, one at each side, stand four
reservoirs, and each is like a large house. They are enclosed by
lavatories to all of which runs water from them. Lengthways
through the court runs an oblong basin of stone with many
spouts along its length pouring forth water. One of these reservoirs,
the largest, is in the vestibule of the Bab al-Jayrun, and
it has more than thirty lavatories. In addition to the long reservoir,
along its wall, are two large round tanks that are so big
as almost to take up the width of the building that contains
this reservoir. They are at a distance from each other, and the
circumference of both is about forty spans. Water spouts forth
in both of them. The second reservoir is in the vestibule of the
Bab al-Natifiyyin beside the school. The third is to the left of
him who goes forth from the Bab al-Barid, and the fourth to
the right of him who emerges from the Bab al-Ziyadah. These
reservoirs are among the great advantages afforded to strangers
and others.
Damascus is full of fountains, and it is rare for a street or
market to be without one. The conveniences in the town are
more than can be described. May God in His power preserve
it within the lands of Islam.
A note on the venerated shrines of Damascus and its great
antiquities
The first of these is the one that contains the head of Yahya
ibn Zakariya' [John the Baptist, son of Zacharias] -upon whom
be (eternal) peace. This is buried in the south aisle of the
venerated mosque in front of the right-hand corner of the
Maqsurah of the Companions - may God hold them in His
favour. Over it is a wooden chest, that stands out from the
column, and on which is a lamp that seems to be of hollow
crystal, and like a large drinking vessel. It is not known whether
it is the glass of 'Iraq or Tyre, or some other ware.
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) 305
The birthplace of Abraham - may God bless him and our
venerated Prophet - is on the slopes of Mount Qasiyun near
a village called Barzah, which is one of the most beautiful of
villages. This mountain enjoys an ancient renown for sanctity,
for the prophets - the blessings of God upon them - climbed
it in order to make their ascent (to heaven). It lies to the north
of the city, and is a parasang distant. The blessed birthplace is
a long and narrow cave, over which has been erected a large
and lofty mosque, divided into many oratories in the form of
commanding upper chambers, and surmounted by a tall minaret.
From this cave Abraham-may God bless and preserve
him - saw first the stars and then the moon and then the sun,
as God Most High has described in His glorious and sublime
Book [Koran VI, 77-9]. Behind the cave is the place where
he would go to pray. All this is related by the hafiz [one who
has committed the Koran to memory] and Syrian traditionalist,
Abu '1-Qasim ibn Hibat Allah ibn 'Asakir the Damascene
in his history, The Story of Damascus, which consists of more
than a hundred volumes. He also mentions that between Bab
Faradis [the Gate of Paradise], which is one of the city's gates
north of the blessed mosque and close to it, and Mount Qasiyun
are the tombs of seventy thousand prophets. Others say that
the seventy thousand were martyrs, and that the prophets
buried there were seven hundred. God best knows.
Outside the city is the ancient cemetery where are buried
the prophets and men of piety, and its blessedness is renowned.
On the side that abuts on the gardens is a low piece of land
adjoining the cemetery and said to be the burial place of seventy
prophets - may God protect them and prevent any other men
from being buried in that place and protect too the tombs
around them. It is never without water, and there has formed
a pool of it, all because of the wish of God Most High for purity.
Also on Mount Qasiyun, to the west, and a mile or more
away from the blessed birthplace (of Abraham), is another cave
called The Cave of the Blood, because above it on the mountain
is the blood of Habil [Abel] who was killed by his brother
306 I Hi. IKAViiLa Or 1UJN JUHAYK
Qabil [Cain] son of Adam - God's blessings upon him. The
blood reaches from about halfway up the mountain to the
cave, and God has preserved red traces of it on stones on the
mountain. The scraping on them has changed them, but they
are like a way on the mountain, and end at the cave. On the
upper half of the mountain121 there are no traces that resemble
them. It is said that they are the same colour as the stones of
the mountain, but they are only from the place where the
murderer killed his brother and dragged him up to the cave.
It is one of the miracles of God Most High, and His miracles
are beyond computation. We read in the chronicle of Ibn al-
Mu'alli al-Asadi that in this cave prayed Abraham, Moses,
Jesus, Lot, and Job - upon them and upon our noble Prophet
be the choicest blessings and peace. Over it stands a mosque
of perfect construction up to which one climbs by steps. It is
like a round, high tower and is enclosed by a wooden lattice.
Within are apartments and conveniences for residence, and it
is opened (to the public) every Thursday. In the cave (or
grotto), which is broad, there are lighted wax candles and
rush lamps.
At the top of the mountain is a grotto called the Grotto of
Adam - may God bless and preserve him - which has a building
over it and is a blessed spot. Below, at the foot of the
mountain, is another called the Cave of Hunger where it is
said that seventy prophets died of hunger. They had possessed
one loaf that they continued to press on each other, passing it
from hand to hand until fate overtook them - God's blessings
upon them. Over this cave too has been built a mosque in
which we saw lamps that are lit (night and)122 day. To all these
shrines are attached endowments consisting of gardens, arable
lands, and houses, to the extent that all that is in the country
is almost wholly comprised of these pious bequests. For every
mosque, school, or convent newly erected, the Sultan will
assign to it a religious endowment that will support it and
those that dwell therein as well as its officials. These also are
among the generous deeds that are enduring. Amongst the
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) 307
princesses who possess the means, some order the building of
a mosque, or an asylum for the poor, or a school, spending on
them large sums, and assigning to them endowments from
their properties; and there are Emirs who do the same. In this
blessed path they reveal a readiness to do good that will be
rewarded by Great and Glorious God.
At the edge of this mountain, where the western plain with
its gardens comes to an end, is the blessed hill mentioned in
the Book of God Most High [Koran XXIII, 50] as being the
dwelling of the Messiah and his mother - God's blessings upon
them both. It is one of the most remarkable sights in the world
for beauty, elegance, height, and perfection of construction,
for the embellished plaster-work, and for the glorious site. It is
like a towering castle, and one climbs to it by steps. The blessed
dwelling is a small grotto in its middle, like a small chamber,
and beside it is another room said to be the oratory of al-Khidr
[Elijah] - may God bless and preserve him. Men hasten forward
to pray at these two blessed spots, especially in the blessed
dwelling. This has an iron door that closes on it. The mosque
encloses the hill, where there are circular paths and a fountain
than which no more beautiful could be seen. Water is brought
to it from the top of the hill, and pours into a conduit in the
wall that is connected with a marble basin, into which the
water falls. A better sight could not be seen. Behind the fountain
are ablution places into every room of which runs water,
which flows round the side adjoining the wall that has the
conduit.
This blessed hill is the limit of the town's gardens, and the
dividing place of its water which here forms seven tributaries,
each one taking its own way. The largest of these is
called Thawra, and it passes under the hill, through whose base
it has cut through the hard stone until it has opened an underground
course wide like a cave. Sometimes a boy or man,
being a bold swimmer, will plunge from the hill-top into the
river and then will be pushed along (by the current) under
the water until he passes through the channel beneath the hill
308 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
and comes out at its foot on the other side. It is indeed a great
hazard.
From this hill one may look over all the western gardens of
the town, and there is no prospect like it for beauty, comeliness,
and spacious vista. And below it flow these seven rivers,
passing through divers ways and entrancing the eyes with the
beauty of their joinings and separations and their gush and
flow. The nobility of the site of this hill, and all its beauties,
are greater than a describer can comprehend even in the highest
flights of his praise. Amongst the famous places of the world
its state is eminent and commanding.
Close to the foot of the hill is a large village called al-Nayrab,
which is hidden in the gardens, for only the tops of its buildings
are seen. It has a cathedral mosque of unsurpassed beauty
whose roof is wholly set with mosaics of many coloured
marbles which the beholder would conceive to be a carpet of
silk brocade. It has a fountain of exquisite beauty and a place
of ablution with ten doors and water running in it and around
it. Above this village, to the south, lies a considerable village,
and one of the finest, called al-Mizzah, which has a large congregational
mosque and a fountain of spring water. Al-Nayrab
has a bath, as indeed have most of the villages of Damascus.
To the east of the city, and on the right of the road leading
to the birthplace of Abraham - upon whom be (eternal) happiness
- is a village called Bayt Lahiyah, by which they mean
(the house of) idols. Its church is now a blessed mosque. There
Azar [Terah] the father of Abraham carved the idols and gave
them shape, but the Friend (of God) Abraham - the blessings
of God upon him and our noble Prophet - came and broke
them. To-day it is a mosque, and in it the people of the village
congregate for their Friday prayers. Its ceiling is overlaid
throughout with mosaics of coloured marble, with devices and
rare designs making him who looks upon it conceive it to be
a carpet of the most perfect embellishment. It is one of the
venerated holy sites.
To this hill are attached many pious endowments, comprising
THE MONTH OF RABI AL-AKHIR (580) 309
gardens, arable lands, and houses (whose revenues) are assigned
to their various uses. Some are allotted under the heading of
expenses for the subsistence of visitors who stay there, some
for clothing under the heading of covering for the night, and
some for food. There are allocations to cover all needs, including
those of the resident guardian as imam and the muezzin charged
with the service of the place, who draw a fixed monthly stipend
from this source. It is a great institution. The present guardian
is one of the marabits [marabouts or monks] from Massuf123
and one of their chief men, called Abu 1-R.abi' Sulayman ibn
Ibrahim ibn Malik, who has standing with the Sultan and the
leading personages of the realm. He receives five dinars monthly,
exclusive of the revenue of the hill. Kindness is impressed on
his features and stamped on him. He is an incumbent of one
of those benefices that provide Maghrib strangers lonely in
these lands with means of support, such as an imamate in a
mosque, lodgement in a school with expenses paid, an appointment
to a zawiyah in a cathedral mosque and gaining a livelihood
there, assisting in the sectional reading of the seven parts
of the Koran, or the curatorship of a blessed shrine and receiving
a benefice from its endowments, and such-like ways of
living of the same blessed pattern as would take long to describe;
and the needy stranger, so long as he has come for righteous
purposes, will be cared for without being given cause to blush.
The other strangers who are not in this state and who have
a trade or craft, are also found divers means of livelihood, such
as being a watchman in a garden, supervisor of a bath, or
keeper of the clothes of the bathers, manager of a mill, custodian
of boys, conducting them to school and returning them
to their homes, and many other occupations. In all this they
trust only strangers from the Maghrib, for their fame for
honesty is high and their repute has spread. The people of the
town do not trust their own fellow citizens. This is one of the
gifts of God Most High towards strangers. Praise and thanks
to Him for what He has granted to His servants.
Should one of the holders of these benefices wish to have
T
310 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
audience of the Sultan, the ruler will receive him and treat him
liberally, granting him a salary paid according to his ability
and office. These virtues are part of the natural character of
these people and their king, both of old and now. The discussion
has led us successively to another question than that
which we were on, but the excursus was needful. God is the
guarantor of real help. There is no Lord but He.
To the west of the city is a large cemetery called The Tombs
of the Martyrs. Here He many Companions of the Prophet,
followers of the Companions, and saintly imams - may God
hold them in His favour. Amongst the famous tombs of the
Companions - may God hold them in His favour - is the tomb
of Abu '1-Darda and that of his mother Umm al-Darda - may
God hold them in His favour. Another blessed place bears the
ancient epitaph, 'In this place are the tombs of many Companions
- may God hold them in His favour - amongst whom
are Fadalah ibn 'Ubayd and Sahl ibn al-Hanzaliyyah who
were of those who swore allegiance to die Apostle of God
[Muhammad] - may God bless and preserve him - beneath
the tree [Koran XLVIII, 18], and the maternal Uncle of the
Believers, Mu'awiyah ibn Abu Sufyan-may God hold him
in His favour - whose convex grave is in that place.' I read
in Fada'il Dimishq [The Merits of Damascus] that the Mother of
the Believers Umm Habibah, sister of Mu'awiyah - may God
hold them in His favour - is buried in Damascus. At this place
there is also the tomb of Wathilah ibn al-Aqsa', one of die
Choice Ones.124
In the place adjoining diis blessed spot is an epitaph which
says, 'This is the tomb of Aws ibn Aws al-Thaqafi', and in
the neighbourhood of this place, close by, is die tomb of Bilal
ibn Hamamah, muezzin of the Apostle of God - may God bless
and preserve him - and at the top (of the headstone) of the
blessed tomb is an epitaph with his name - may God hold him
in His favour. Prayers said in this blessed place are answered,
as has been experienced by many saints and godly men who
have been blessed by their visit to these tombs. There are many
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) 311
Companions and other saintly men whose names have been
effaced and of whom the memory has passed away. Also in
this place are the shrines of many of the family of the Prophet,
men and women - may God hold them in His favour - whose
edifices have been adorned by the Shi'ites and which have
large pious endowments.
One of the most embellished of these shrines is that named
after 'AH ibn Abi Talib - may God hold him in His favour -
over which has been built a splendid mosque of most elegant
construction. Fast by it is a garden filled with oranges with
water pouring into it from a spring fountain. All the mosque
is draped with curtains, large and small, hanging from its sides.
In the mihrab is a huge stone that had been split in half, but
has been put together so that there is no sign at all of the
cleavage. The Shi'ites say that it split for 'AH - may God hold
him in His favour - either from a blow from his sword or by
a divine order done at his hands. It is not recorded that 'Ali -
may God hold him in His favour - ever entered this town but,
Oh my God, they declare that it was in a dream. Perhaps for
them dreams have more validity than the events of consciousness.
This stone gave occasion for the erection of this shrine.
In these lands, the Shi'ites have strange manifestations. They
are more numerous than the Sunnis, and have filled the land
with their doctrines. They have divers sects, among whom are
the Rafidites who are blasphemers [see note 58], the Imamites,
the Zaydites, who say that the Imamate is exclusive to the house
of 'Ali, the Isma'ilites, and the Nusayrites who are infidels for
they attribute divinity to 'Ali -may God hold him in His favour.
God is above what they say. Then there are the Ghurabites
who say that 'Ali - may God hold him in His favour - more
resembled the Prophet-may God bless and preserve himthan
a raven does a raven and trace this assertion to the Faithful
Spirit [the angel Gabriel] - upon whom be (eternal) peace. But
God is far above what they say. Other sects there are that it is
impossible to enumerate. God has allowed them to go astray,
and with them many of His creatures. We beg God to protect
312 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
us from error in religion, and in Him we take refuge from
the schisms of the heretics.
God placed these Rafidites under the power of a Sunni sect
called al-Nubuwiyah,126 who reverence the futuwah [manly
qualities or mystical heroism of the Prophet] and all virile
matters. Whoever is admitted to their order because of a virtue
which they recognise in him, they invest with the trousers (of
manliness) and admit him to their number. They do not find
it fitting that any of them should cry for help when in distress.
In this they follow a strange practice. If one of them swears
by the manly qualities, he will hold his oath sacred. They kill
these Rafidites wheresoever they find them, and in the matter
of showing contempt or friendship, their ways are very strange.
One of the venerated shrines is that of Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah,
chief of the Khazraj and a Companion of the Apostle of God
- may God bless and preserve him. It is in a village called al-
Manihah, east of the city and distant four miles. Over his tomb
is a small mosque of fine architecture, and the tomb is in its
centre with this inscription at the top: 'This is the tomb of
Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah, chief of the Khazraj and a Companion of
the Apostle of God - may God bless and preserve him.' Among
the shrines of those of the family of the Prophet - may God
hold them in His favour - are those of Umm Kulthum the
daughter of 'Ah ibn Abi Talib - may God hold them both in
His favour. She is called 'the little Zaynab', Umm Kulthum
being a nickname given her by the Prophet - may God bless
and preserve him - because she resembled his daughter Umm
Kulthum - may God hold her in His favour. God best knows
concerning this. Her venerated tomb is in a village south of
Damascus and a parasang distant, called Rawiyah. Over it is
a large mosque with houses outside it. It has pious endowments.
The people of these parts know it as 'the tomb of the Lady
Umm Kulthum'. We went to it and passed the night there,
gaining blessings from seeing it. God will profit us in this.
In the cemetery west of the city are many tombs of the
relatives of the Prophet - may God hold them in His favour.
THE MONTH OF RABI' AL-AKHIR (580) m
Over two of them is a mosque, and it is said that they are the
tombs of the sons of al-Hasan and al-Husayn - may God hold
them in His favour. There is another mosque containing a tomb
said to be that of Sukaynah, daughter of al-Husayn - may God
hold them in His favour-but it may be another Sukaynah
of the Prophet's family. Amongst the shrines there is also the
tomb in the cathedral mosque of al-Nayrab, in a room in the
eastern part. It is said to be that of Umm Maryam - may God
hold her in His favour. In the village of Darayah is the tomb
of Abu Muslim al-Khawlani - may God hold him in His
favour - over which is a dome to indicate it. In this village
there is also the tomb of Abu Sulayman al-Darani - may God
hold them in His favour. This village lies to the west of Damascus
and is distant from it four miles. Amongst the tombs
that we did not see, but which were described to us, were
those of Seth [Gen. v. 3; 1 Chron. i. 1; Luke iii. 38] and Noah
[Gen. v. 29] on whom be (eternal) peace. These are in the Baqa',
two days' journey from Damascus. Someone who measured
the tombs told us that he found that of Seth to be forty arms'
lengths [ba*] and Noah's thirty. Beside Noah's tomb is that
of a daughter of his. There is an edifice over these tombs,
attached to which are many pious bequests, and it has a
stipendiary Intendant.
Also among the blessed shrines in the western cemetery, near
the Bab al-Jabiyah, is that of Uways al-Qarani - may God hold
him in His grace - and those of 'Umayyid Caliphs - God's
mercy rest upon their souls. It is said that these are at the Bab
al-Saghir [the Little Gate] near the cemetery, and that over
them to-day is an inhabited house. The venerated shrines in
this city are more than can be recorded, and we have but
outlined those that are celebrated and known.
Another of the famous shrines in Damascus is the Masjid
al-Aqdam [Mosque of the Footprints], two miles south of the
city, on the side of the highway to the Hejaz, the coast, and
Egypt. In this mosque is a small chamber containing a stone
on which is inscribed: 'A certain pious man in his sleep saw
314 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the Prophet - may God bless and preserve him - who said to
him, "Here is the tomb of the brother of Moses - may God
bless and preserve him." ' The Kathib al-Ahmar [the Hill of
Red Sand] is on this road and near this place, between Ghaliyah
and Ghuwayliyah, as it comes to us in the tradition; these are
two (separate) places. The state of blessedness of this mosque
is very great, and it is said that the light never fades from the
place. The tomb is reported to be where the inscribed stone
lies. It possesses many endowments. As for the footprints, they
are impressed on the stones along the road to the mosque and
you will find a footprint on each stone. The number of footprints
is nine and it is said that they are those of Moses - upon
whom be (eternal) peace. God best knows the truth of this.
There is no God but He.

A collocation of notes on the conditions of the city (of
Damascus)
May God cause it to prosper in. Islam
This city has eight Gates: Bab Sharqi [East Gate] is to the
east. It has a white minaret, and it is said that Jesus - upon
whom be (eternal) peace - will descend there (when He comes
in glory), according to the tradition which says that He will
descend at the white minaret east of Damascus. Next to this
Gate is Bab Tuma [(St.) Thomas' Gate] which also is to the
east. Then comes Bab al-Salamah [Gate of Safety], then Bab
al-Faradis [Gate of Paradise] which is to the north, then Bab
al-Faraj [Gate of Consolation], then Bab al-Nasr [Gate of
Victory] which is to the west, then Bab al-Jabiyah [Gate of
the Water-Trough] also to the west, then Bab al-Saghir [the
Little Gate] to the south-west.
The Great Mosque lies towards the northern side of the city.
The city is surrounded by suburbs save on the east side, and
a little of the adjacent south. The suburbs are large, but the
city itself is not excessively big, and inclines to be long. Its
streets are narrow and dark, and its houses are made of mud
and reeds, arranged in three storeys one over the other, so that
fire speedily takes hold of them. Damascus contains as many
people as three cities, for it is the most populous in the world.
Its beauty is all outside, not in.
Inside the city is a church held in great consideration by the
316 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Rum. It is called Mary's Church, and after the temple in
Jerusalem they have none more esteemed than this. It is an
elegant structure with remarkable pictures that amaze the mind
and hold the gaze, and its spectacle is wonderful indeed. It is
in the hands of the Rum, who are never molested within it.
There are about twenty colleges in the city, and two hospitals,
one old and the other new. The new is the finer and
bigger, and receives a daily allowance of about fifteen dinars.
It has a staff who maintain a register that records the names of
the sick and the items they require of medicine, food, and
other things. Early each morning the physicians come to the
hospital to visit the sick and order the preparation of the proper
medicines and food according as suits each person. The other
hospital is managed in the same way, but more people use the
new. The old one stands west of the venerated mosque. There
is also a system of treatment for confined lunatics, and they
are bound in chains. We take refuge in God from this trial
and sore affliction. Some of them let fall some pleasant witticisms
according to what we would hear. One of the drollest
I heard was of a man who had taught the Koran. The son of
a notable in the town, a youth bearing some traits of beauty
called Nasr Allah [the Help of God], was in the habit of reading
it to him, and the man became infatuated with this youth.
His passion increased until his brain became disordered and he
was taken to the hospital, and his sickness and disgrace became
notorious. His father used to visit him and once said to him,
'Go, and get back to the part of the Koran you were at,' and
the man, jesting with the boldness of the possessed, replied,
'What part of it have I retained? Nothing of the Koran remains
in my memory save "when there comes the Help of Allah" '
[Koran CX, i ] . Men laughed at him and at what he said, and
we beg of God that he and all Muslims might be forgiven.
He remained in this state until he died; may God grant him
His forbearance.
These hospitals are among the great glories of Islam, and so
are the colleges. One of the finest-looking colleges in the world
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) JI7
is that of Nur al-Din - may God's mercy rest upon his soul -
and in it is his tomb - may God murnine it. It is a sumptuous
palace. Water pours into it through an aqueduct in the middle
of a great canal, filling an oblong fountain and finally falling
into a large cistern in the centre of the building. The eyes are
enchanted by the beauty of the sight, and all who see it renew
their supplications for Nur al-Din-may God's mercy rest upon
his soul.
As for the convents which they call khawaniq, they are many
and are used by the Sufis. They are elaborately decorated palaces,
with water flowing to all their parts forming the most agreeable
sight one could see. The members of this order of Sufis
are the kings of these parts, for God has sufficed them of the
goods and favours of the world, and freed them from thoughts
of winning their livelihood that they might apply them to His
worship, lodging them in palaces that remind them of the
palaces of heaven. Those happy ones of them who have received
God's help, enjoy, by His grace, the favours of this world and
the next. They follow a noble path, and their social conduct
is admirable. The style of their ritual in worship is remarkable,
and excellent is their custom of assembling to listen to
impassioned (dance) music. In these ecstasied and abstracted
states the world forsakes them, such is their rapture and transport.
In a word, all their affairs are wonderful, and they hope
for a future life of bliss and felicity.
One of their most splendid convents is a place called al-Qasr,
an enormous structure rising alone into the skies. In its upper
storey are apartments than which I have never seen more beautiful
for their lofty site. It is half a mile distant from the city,
and has an extensive garden connected with it. It had once
been die pleasure-lodge of a Turkish king. The story goes that
he was one night taking his ease in it when some Sufis passed
by, and some of the wine which the Turks were accustomed
to drink in the castle was poured out for them. They raised
the matter to Nur al-Din, who immediately demanded it from
its owner as a gift and then gave it in perpetual endowment
318 THE TRAVELS Or IBN JUBAYR
to the Sufis. Wonder lasted long at bounty like this, which
remained an enduring monument to the merits of Nur al-Din
- may God's mercy rest upon his soul.
The virtues of this pious man were great, and he was indeed
among the ascetic kings. He died in the month of Shawwal
in the year 569 [15th of May, 1174]. After him came Saladin
to power, and the virtues of his way are known. His state
among kings is great, and a lasting monument to his honour
is his raising of the customs tax on the Hejaz road, giving a
grant in compensation to its ruler. For long times this accursed
tax had lasted before God annulled it at the hand of this just
Sultan - may God prosper him. Amongst the merits of Nur
al-Din - may God's mercy rest upon his soul - was his assigning
to the strangers from the Maghrib who were employed in
the Malikite zawiyah of the blessed cathedral mosque many
pious endowments including two mills, seven gardens, arable
lands, a bath, and two shops in the perfumers' market. I was
told by one of the Maghrabis who supervised this, one Abu
'1-Hasan 'Ah ibn Sardal al-Jayyani [from Jaen in Spain],
known as al-Aswad [the Black], that if properly controlled
these endowments yield five hundred dinars a year. Nur al-Din
- may God's mercy rest upon his soul - showed much favour
towards these people. May God reward him for the good he
did. For the readers of the Book of Great and Glorious God
he prepared an endowed house in which they might live.
The conveniences for strangers in this city are beyond computation,
more especially for those who commit to memory
the Book of Great and Glorious God and those devoted to
study, to whom the attitude of this town is most extraordinary.
All these eastern cities are of this fashion, but this city is more
populous and wealthy. Whoever of the young men of the
Maghrib seeks prosperity, let him move to these lands and
leave his country in the pursuit of knowledge and he will find
many forms of help. The first of these is the release of the
mind from the consideration of livelihood, and this is the
greatest and most important. For when zeal is present the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) 3ig
student will find the way clear to exert his utmost endeavour,
and there will be no excuse for lagging behind, save in the
case of those addicted to idleness and procrastination, and to
them this exhortation is not addressed. We speak only to the
zealous, who in their own land find that the search for the
means of living comes between them and their aim of seeking
knowledge. Well then the door of this East is open, so enter
it in peace industrious youth and seize the chance of undistracted
(study) and seclusion before a wife and children cling
to you and you gnash your teeth in regret at the time you
have lost. God is the Helper and the Guide. There is no God
but He. I have given counsel to those I found listening, and
called to those I heard answering. He who is directed by God
is on the right path. Glorious is His power. Exalted is His
majesty.
If in all these eastern lands there were nothing but the readiness
of its people to show bounty to strangers and generosity
to me poor, especially in the case of the inhabitants of the
countryside (it would be enough). For you will find admirable
their eagerness to show kindness to guests, which is enough
to bring them honour. It sometimes comes to pass that one
of them offers his piece (of bread) to a poor man, upon whom
refusing he will cry and say, 'Had God seen in me any good,
this needy man would have eaten my food.' In this they reveal
a noble heart. One of their admirable traits is dieir respect for
the pilgrim, despite the shortness of the distance to Mecca and
the ease and facility with which they could make the journey.
When the pilgrims return, they stroke them with their hands
and press upon them to secure their benedictions.
One of the strangest things told us about this is that when
the pilgrims from Damascus, together widi those from the
Maghrib who had joined them, returned to the city in this
year of 580, a vast concourse of people, men and women,
went form to meet them, shaking the hands of the pilgrims
and touching them, giving dinars to the poor amongst them
that diey met, and offering them food. One who witnessed
320 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
it told me that many women met pilgrims and gave them
bread which if they bit the women would snatch from their
hands and hasten to eat it in order that they might be blessed
in the pilgrims' having tasted it. In place of it they gave them
dirhams, and did other remarkable things, the opposite of what
we were accustomed to in the Maghrib. At the time of the
reception of the pilgrims at Baghdad the same thing was done
to us, or something near to it. But if we sought to relate this
matter exhaustively we should depart from the purpose of our
narrative, so we have given a glimpse that offers some indication,
and that shall content us in the place of diffuseness.
Any stranger in these parts whom God has rendered fit for
solitude may, if he wishes, attach himself to a farm and live
there the pleasantest life with the most contented mind. Bread
in plenty will be given to him by the people of the farm, and
he may engage himself in the duties of an imam or in teaching,
or what he will, and when he is wearied of the place, he
may remove to another farm, or climb Mount Lebanon or
Mount Judi and there find the saintly hermits who nothing
seek but to please Great and Glorious God, and remain with
them so long as he wishes, and then go where he wills. It is
strange how the Christians round Mount Lebanon, when they
see any Muslim hermits, bring them food and treat them kindly,
saying that these men are dedicated to Great and Glorious God
and that they should therefore share with them. This mountain
is one of the most fertile in the world, having all kinds
of fruits, running waters, and ample shade, and rarely is it
without a hermit or an ascetic. And if the Christians treat the
opponents of their religion in this fashion, what think you of
the treatment that the Muslims give each other?
One of the astonishing things that is talked of is that though
the fires of discord burn between the two parties, Muslim and
Christian, two armies of them may meet and dispose themselves
in battle array, and yet Muslim and Christian travellers
will come and go between them without interference. In this
connection we saw at this time, that is the month of Jumada
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) 321
'1-Uk, the departure of Saladin with all the Muslims troops
to lay siege to the fortress of Kerak, one of the greatest of the
Christian strongholds lying astride the Hejaz road and hindering
the overland passage of the Muslims. Between it and Jerusalem
lies a day's journey or a little more. It occupies the
choicest part of the land in Palestine, and has a very wide
dominion with continuous settlements, it being said that the
number of villages reaches four hundred. This Sultan invested
it, and put it to sore straits, and long the siege lasted, but still
the caravans passed successively from Egypt to Damascus, going
through the lands of the Franks without impediment from
them. In the same way the Muslims continuously journeyed
from Damascus to Acre (through Frankish territory), and likewise
not one of the Christian merchants was stopped or hindered
(in Muslim territories).
The Christians impose a tax on the Muslims in their land
which gives them full security; and likewise the Christian merchants
pay a tax upon their goods in Muslim lands. Agreement
exists between them, and there is equal treatment in all cases.
The soldiers engage themselves in their war, while the people
are at peace and the world goes to him who conquers. Such
is the usage in war of the people of these lands; and in the
dispute existing between the Muslim Emirs and their kings it
is the same, the subjects and the merchants interfering not.
Security never leaves them in any circumstance, neither in peace
nor in war. The state of these countries in this regard is truly
more astonishing than our story can fully convey. May God
by His favour exalt the word of Islam.
Damascus has a castle where the Sultan lives. It stands apart,
to the west of the city opposite the Bab al-Faraj [Gate of Consolation],
one of the city's gates. The Sultan's cathedral mosque
is there, and the Friday service is held in it. Fast by it and outside
the city are two horse-courses, so green as to seem to be
rolls of silk-brocade. They are enclosed by a wall, with the
river running between them, and bordering them is a large
wood of poplars forming a very pleasant sight. The Sultan goes
322 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
out to them to play sawalajan [a kind of polo],126 and to race
his horses. There is no place like them for the eye to wander
in. Every evening the Sultan's sons visit them to practise archery,
race horses, and play sawalajan.
In this city and its suburbs there are about a hundred baths,
and it has around forty ablution houses in all of which flows
water. For the stranger, there is no better city in all these lands
than this, for its conveniences are manifold. What we have
mentioned of them is enough. May God by His favour keep
it Muslim territory.
The markets of Damascus are the finest in the world and
the best arranged, and the most handsomely constructed. Especially
is this so with the qaysariyahs which are tall as caravanserais
and furnished with iron gates like those of a castle. Each qaysariyah
is distinguished by its shape and iron gates. The city
has another market called Al-Suq al-Kabir [the Great Market],
which extends from Bab al-Jabiyah to Bab Sharqi [along the
street called Straight]. In it is a very small chamber used as an
oratory. To the south is a stone on which it is said that Abraham
- may God bless and preserve him - broke the idols which his
father had brought to sell.127
The tradition concerning the house named after (the Caliph)
'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz, which is to-day a Sufi convent and
stands in the vestibule of the Bab al-Natifiyyin and which we
have mentioned before, is a very curious one. It is that the
man who bought and furnished the house and gave it large
endowments, and who instructed that he should be buried in
it and that every Friday all the Koran should be read over his
tomb, assigning to those who attended every Friday a ritl1**
of white bread, the equivalent of three Maghribi ritls, was a
foreigner called al-Sumaysati [the Samosatian],129 Sumaysat
[Samosat] being a foreign city (on the Euphrates). This man
was distinguished for his piety and asceticism. The origin of
his prosperity and wealth, as was told to us, (was as follows).
One day, in the vestibule and beside the house of which we
are talking, he came upon a black man, sick and abandoned,
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) 323
uiicared for and neglected; and to merit a heavenly reward and
win recompense from Great and Glorious God, he undertook
the nursing, serving, and attention of this unfortunate. When
his death drew nigh, the sick man called his nurse the Samosatian
and said unto him, 'You were kind to me, acted as a
servant to me, treated me gently in my sickness, and pitied
my condition and my being a stranger in a strange land. I wish
therefore to reward you in addition to the reward that Great
and Glorious God, if He wills, will grant you on my behalf in
the life to come. I was one of the pages of the Caliph al-Mu'tadid
the 'Abbaside, and was known as Zimam al-Dar [The Intendant
- a eunuch - in charge of the Palace] and possessed esteem and
standing. But the Caliph became enangered with me over some
affair and I was driven forth and came to this city where, by
God's will, I was smitten with this affliction. Then God in His
mercy caused you to come to my help. So now I appoint you
my trustee and by virtue of that charge you, when I am dead
and you have washed me, to go, with the blessings of God Most
High, to Baghdad and there enquire with circumspection after
the house of the Sahib al-Zimam, the Caliph's page. When
you have been directed to it, then use all artifice to rent it,
and in this I pray God to give you help. When you are in
residence, go to' - and he named a place, giving him indications
to it - 'and there dig a certain depth. Then pull away
a board that you will find lying crossways under the earth and
take what you will find buried beneath. Use this in your own
interest, and in the good and charitable works that God may
direct you to, and so, if He wills, bring blessings upon yourself
The testator - God's mercy on his soul-then died and
the trustee, with his testament, left for Baghdad. God helped
him in the hiring of the house and he came to the place described
where he removed a priceless treasure of vast quantity and
enormous value. He hid it among bundles of merchandise that
he had brought and (with it) left Baghdad for Damascus. There
he bought this house named after 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz -
may God hold him in His favour - and converted it into a
324 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
convent for the Sufis, embellishing it and buying farms and
houses as endowments for it, placing it all to the benefit of the
Sufis. He enjoined that he should be buried in it, and that the
whole of the Koran should be read over his tomb every Friday,
assigning to all those who attended it that which we have
described. In this strangers and the poor find much benefit,
and the convent is crammed with readers every Friday. When
the reading of the Koran is over, they pray for him and then
depart, each one being given a ritl of bread as described. To
the deceased there remains a fine memorial and the good (that
he has done). May God's mercy and approbation rest upon him.
The Kawthar, which we have mentioned, is also read in the
cathedral mosque every day following the afternoon prayers,
and is especially for those who have not yet learnt the Koran
by heart. Its origin is also due to a rich man's dying and enjoining
in his will that his tomb should be in the venerated cathedral
mosque, and giving endowments that yielded one hundred
and fifty dinars a year for the benefit of those who had not
memorised the Koran. They read from the surah of the Kawthar
to the end of the Koran, and every three months forty dinars
is divided among them.130
It is related that a king of former times died and also left
injunctions that his tomb be in the cathedral mosque, in the
qiblah and in a place where it would not be seen. He assigned
huge endowments that yielded annually a thousand and four
hundred dinars, or even more, for the benefit of the daily
readers of a seventh part of the Koran. The place of assembly
for the readers of this blessed seventh portion, which happens
after the morning prayers each day, is in the eastern part of
the Maqsurah of the Companions - may God be pleased with
them - and it is declared that in this place is the tomb of the
king. The reading of the seventh portion must not be done
beyond that area which is contiguous with the south wall
towards the east wall. Great and Glorious God will not fail
to reward those who do good.
All these noble bequests have remained unchanged with the
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) 32.5
passing of days. May God profit the benefactors. Let these
requests suffice (to illustrate) a land where men are guided to
such acts to gain the approbation of Great and Glorious God.
For the poor who are accustomed to sit on the east side of the
venerated cathedral mosque, and who have no place of retreat,
there is an endowment founded by some of those who seek
a heavenly reward and have been guided by God in their
bequests. But it would take long to recount the charitable and
benevolent acts by which God has protected the stranger in
these parts.
It is a custom of the people of Damascus, and of these other
virtuous lands, a custom which we hope for them is acceptable
to Great and Glorious God, to make it their purpose every
year on the day of'Arafah to stand in their cathedral mosque
following the afternoon prayers, their imam with them and
their heads uncovered, praying to their Lord and seeking the
blessings of the hour in which the deputation to Great and
Glorious God and the pilgrims to His Sacred House stand upon
(Mount) 'Arafat. They stand praying and beseeching increasingly
to Great and Glorious God, entreating His favour for
the sake of the pilgrims to His Sacred House, and so continue
until the set of the sun's disc. They compute the hour of the
return of the pilgrims from 'Arafat, and then themselves disjoin,
weeping at'their being kept from that sublime standing
ground on 'Arafat, and beseeching Great and Glorious God
to bring them to it, and not to let them lack the blessings of
His acceptance of their (intended) act.
One of the grandest and most remarkable sights in the world,
among its imposing edifices of miraculous art and perfection,
and admitted to be beyond description even in the most eloquent
of tongues, is (achieved by) climbing to the top of the
Lead Dome that we have already mentioned in this narrative
as rising up in the centre of the venerated cathedral mosque,
and entering into its interior, and then turning a reflective gaze
on its superb structure, with the cupola poised within it like
a hollow sphere inside another larger than itself. We climbed
u
326 THE TRAVELS Or InN JUXJAYK.
to it with a company of our Maghrib companions in the forenoon
of Monday the 18th of Jumada '1-Ula (first ascending)
a stairway in the western colonnade of the court where had
anciently been a minaret. We walked along the roof of the
venerated mosque, which is all lead slabs arranged in the manner
we have described, each slab being four spans long and three
wide, although it sometimes happened that some were smaller
or bigger, until we came to the dome. This we climbed by
means of a ladder fixed to it, and we were nearly carried away
by giddiness. "We therefore crawled round the platform that
encircles it. It is of lead, and is six spans wide. We could not
stand on it because of the fearfulness of our position, and made
speed to enter the inside of the dome through one of the grated
windows that open in the lead-work. Then we observed a spectacle
that sends the senses reeling, and that the mind cannot
fully comprehend in the grandeur of its attributes. We walked
around a platform of large wooden planks encircling the small
inner cupola that stands inside the Lead Dome in the fashion
we have described. Here are windows through which one may
look down at the mosque and those within it; and we saw
men as if they were boys in school. This cupola is round like
a sphere, and its exterior is of wood strengthened by stout
wooden ribs bound by iron bands, each rib curving over the
cupola and all meeting at a central wooden disc at the summit.
Inside this cupola as seen from the interior of the venerated
mosque, are wooden panels fitted together and joined in wondrous
fashion. They are all gilded in the most beautiful form
of that work, adorned with many colours, exquisitely carved,
dazzling the eyes with the refulgence of the gold. Minds are
baffled at the manner of their assembly and adjustment, so
extreme is the height. One of these wooden panels we saw
lying inside the cupola and it was not less than six spans in
length and four in width, but in their place above they seem
to the eye as if the circumference of each of them were a span
or two spans at most, so great is the height.
The Lead Dome enfolds this cupola. It also is strengthened
THE MONTH OF JUMADA L-ULA (580) 327
by huge ribs of solid wood, bound in the middle by iron bands.
These ribs number forty-eight, and the distance between each
is four spans. They bend round in remarkable fashion and their
ends meet at a central wooden disc at the summit. The circumference
of this Leaden Dome is eighty paces, which is two
hundred and sixty [forty] spans. Its state is greater than description
can attain, and what we have described is but a glimpse
from which the remainder can be conceived.
Under the long nave called the 'eagle', which is below these
two domes, is a huge canopy which acts as roof to the maqsurah,
and between the one and the other is an ornamental
stucco ceiling. This is set with countless wooden beams, entwining
and arching over each other and so arranged as to present
a stupefying spectacle. Engaged in the whole length of the wall
are die pilasters supporting the two domes, and in that wall
are stones each of which weigh many qintars [1 qintar=ioo
rids] and such that an elephant could not move them, much
less any other animal. The greatest marvel is how they came
to be raised to such a prodigious height, and how human ability
achieved it. Glory to God who inspired His servants to such
glorious works, enabling them to produce what is not in human
nature to do, and revealing His miracles through the hands of
those of His creatures whom He wishes. There is no God
but He.
The two domes rest on a circular base composed of massive
stones. On this stand short, solid pilasters formed of big, hard
stones. A window opens between each pilaster, and the windows
run all round the circle. The two domes appear to the
eye to be one, but we have alluded to their being two, one
being inside the other, the uppermost being the Lead Dome.
Amongst the wonders that we noticed in these two domes was
that we saw in them no spider spinning its web, although for
a long time there had been no inspection by anyone, nor any
persons engaged to clear their surfaces. In similar places spiders
are present in great numbers. We had previously been assured
that in the venerated mosque no spider spun its web, nor would
328 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the bird called khuttaf [swallow] enter it. We have mentioned
this before in our narrative.
We left and went down, consumed with wonder at this
stupendous spectacle, so miraculously constructed and beyond
description's reach. Men say that on the face of the world there
is no more wonderful structure to look upon, none loftier or
more marvellously built, than this dome, save what is reported
of the Dome (of the Rock) in Jerusalem, which is said to be
still higher in the skies than this. In a word, the spectacle and
consideration of the superb aspect of its form, and its vast proportions
when observing it both by climbing and by entering
it, is more astounding than what is told of the wonders of
the world. Power belongs to the One God, the Conqueror,
there is no God but He.
The people of Damascus and other peoples of these lands
observe a curious ceremonial in their funerals. They walk in
front of the bier with reciters who chant the Koran with
moving voices and tearful notes that tear the heart for grief
and compassion. They lift up their voices which strike the
ears and move the eyes to tears. They pray over the bier in
the cathedral mosque, in front of the maqsurah, and every bier
must go to this mosque. When they come to the door they
cease their intoning and enter to the place where prayers will
be said over the bier. But if the departed be one of the imams
of the mosque or one of its keepers, then a distinction is made
for him, and they come into the place of prayer still chanting
the Koran.
They sometimes assemble for the ceremony of condolence
in the west cloister of the court, beside the Bab al-Barid, and
recite the prayers one by one and then sit down. In front of
them are copies of the Koran which they read while the
managers of the obsequies raise their voices to announce the
venerated and leading men of the city as they arrive at the
ceremony, vesting them with imposing appellations of distinction,
which they confer on all alike, and all referring to din
[religion]. You will hear whatever you wish: Sadr al-Din,

'1-Din, Jamal al-Din, Majd al-Din, Fakhr al-Din, Sharaf al-Din,
Mu'in al-Din, Muhyi '1-Din, Zaki '1-Din, Najib al-Din, without
a limit to similar false titles. Particularly in the case of
jurisprudents you may have such designations as Sayyid al-
'Ulama, Jamal al-'Immah, Hujjat al-Islam, Fakhr al-Shari'ah,
Sharaf al-Millah, Mufti '1-Fariqayn and such-like pretentious
epithets without end. Each will then repair to his shari'ah,131
haughtily sweeping his train, with aloofness and disdain. When
they have finished, and have ceased reciting the Koran and that
part of the ceremony is ended, their preachers rise one by one
according to their degree and exhort, invoke pious memories,
warn, of the deceits of the world, put men upon their guard,
recite some fitting lines of poetry, and then end with words of
consolation for the bereaved, and prayers for him and the
deceased. The speaker will then sit and be followed by another
in the same style until they have all ended and gone their ways.
Ofttimes there is such an assembly that is profitable to whoever
attends it.
The people of these parts address each other as Mulai [Lord]
and Sayyid [Sir], and use the expressions 'Your servant' and
'Your Excellency'. When one meets another, instead of giving
the ordinary greeting he says respectfully, 'Here is your slave,'
or 'Here is your servant at your service.' They make presents
of honorifics to each other. Gravity with them is a fabulous
affair.
Their style of salutation is either a deep bow or a prostration,
and you will see their necks in play, lifting and lowering,
stretching and contracting. Sometimes they will go on like this
for a long time, one going down as the other rises, their turbans
tumbling between them. This style of greeting, mclining
as in prayer, we have observed in female slaves, or when handmaids
make some request. How strange are these men. How
can they assume the titles of anklet-wearers [women]. They
apply themselves with assiduity to things that proud souls disdain,
and practise abuses of the capitation, which Muslim law
330 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
forbids. In this direction they have many vain customs. What
odd people! If they treat each other in this way, reaching such
an extravagance of epithets in their common intercourse, how
do they address their Sultans and comport themselves with
such? The tail is equal to the head with them, and they do not
distinguish between the governor and the governed. Glory to
God who created men of all kinds. He has no partner. There
is no God but He.
A singular habit in all these lands is their walking, great and
small, with their hands behind their backs, one hand holding
the other. They make their deep inclinations of greeting in this
fashion, which has an air of obedience, in token of humbleness
and modesty, as if they had been treated with violence,
and had had their hands bound behind their backs. They deem
this posture to set them apart as persons of distinction and
honour, as well as giving liveliness to their limbs and relief
from fatigue. The venerable among them is he who draws his
train a span along the ground, or puts ais hands behind his
back the one over the other. They have adopted this manner
of walking as obligatory, and every one of them has embellished
himself with this bad practice and seen it to be good.
I beg the pardon of God for them.
But in the etiquette of shaking hands they have usages which
renew their security (with God) and invite God's pardon (for
their other faults), according to the preaching of the tradition
transmitted from the Prophet of God - may God bless and preserve
him - on the matter of hand-shaking. They employ them
after the prayers, more especially after the morning and afternoon
prayers. When the imam salutes (the congregation) and
has ended the prayers, the people go to him and shake his hand
and then advance on each other, shaking hands with those to
right and left of them. They then leave this pardon-bringing
service with the grace of Great and Glorious God. We have
already mentioned in this narrative how they employ this habit
of shaking each other's hands when they observe the new moon,
and how they pray for each other the blessings and happiness
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-ULA (580) w
of the new month, and that they might be accompanied by
felicity and well-being during that month and those that will
follow. That also is a beneficial practice, for which God will
advantage them because of the prayers for each other, the
renewal of affection, and the shaking of each other's hands by
the Faithful. (All this is from) the mercy and favour of God
Most High.
We have also spoken, in another place in this journal, of the
righteous path of the Sultan of these lands, Salah al-Din [Saladin]
Abu '1-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub, of his memorable deeds in
affairs of the world and of religion, and of his zeal in waging
holy war against the enemies of God. Because north of this
land there is none belonging to Islam, most of Syria being in
the hands of the Franks, God in Flis mercy gave to the Muslims
here this Sultan, who never retires to a place of rest, nor long
abides at ease, nor ceases to make his saddle his council-chamber.
We have been staying in this city for two months, yet when
we alighted at it he had already gone forth to the siege of the
fortress of Kerak, of which also we have made mention, and
he still invests it - may God Most High assist him to conquer it.
We listened to one of the jurisprudents and leading men of
Damascus, who acknowledged the righteousness of this Sultan
and who attended his audiences. He spoke of him in the presence
of a gathering of learned men and jurisprudents, describing three
acts of virtue in three stories, and we have seen fit to record
them here. One concerns the magnanimity of his disposition.
He had just forgiven the crime of someone who had offended
against him and said, 'For my part, I would rather miss the
mark in being merciful than strike home in (deserved) punishment.'
Here is the forbearance that was the aim of Ahnaf.
Again at a symposium of poetry held in his presence, where
the bounty and excellencies of ancient kings were talked of,
he declared: 'By Allah, did I give the world to him who came
to me in hope, I would not deem it too much; and if I emptied
to him all that is in my treasury, it would not console him for
the hot blush on his cheek as he asked of me.' Here indeed
332 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
was the way of al-Rashid or of Ja'far in generosity. In another
instance, a favourite and much-liked slave appealed to him
against a cameleer, complaining that the man had sold him an
unsound camel, or had restored to him a camel with an
unsoundness that had not been there before. The Sultan
answered, 'What can I do for you? The Muslims have a qadi
who decides between them; over both the chief men and
the people the justice of our laws extends, and its injunctions
and its interdicts we must alike obey. I am but the servant
of the law and its Shihnah', which is the word for chief of
police, 'and justice will decide for you or against you.' In this
settlement we see the manner that was 'Umar's. These stories
are enough to shed glory on the Sultan. May God, by His
favour, grant that Islam and the Muslims may long enjoy his
preservation to them.
The Month ofjumada 'l-Akhirah (580)
[9th of September-7th of October, 1184]
May God grant us His blessings
THE new moon rose on the night of Sunday the 9th of
September according to the foreigners, while we were in
Damascus - may God protect it - on the point of departure to
Acre - may God restore it to us - to seek a passage by sea with
some Christian merchants in the ships they had got ready for
the autumn sailing which they called 'al-salibiyah'.132 May God
let us know His avouched grace, giving us of His care and
protection, in His power and strength. Glory be to God, the
All-Merciful, the Benefactor, the Giver of wealth and benefits.
There is no God but He.
We left Damascus on the evening of Thursday the 5th of
the said month, which was the 13 th of September, in a large
caravan of merchants travelling with their merchandise to Acre.
One of the strangest things in the world is that Muslim caravans
go forth to Frankish lands, while Frankish captives enter
Muslim lands. In this regard, as we were leaving, we observed
a singular event. When Saladin was laying siege to the fortress
of Kerak, already mentioned in this diary [p. 311], the Franks,
having been summoned from all sides, had marched upon him
in great strength and sought to arrive before he did at the place
of water, and also to intercept his supplies from Muslim
country. But the Sultan, leaving the fortress, led his whole
force against them and arrived before them at the watering
place. The Franks shunned his path, and, following a rough
road on which most of their animals perished, directed themselves
towards the fortress of Kerak. The Sultan had closed
to them all other roads leading to their own country, and
there was left to them no other but the road by the fortress
through the desert. Thus, because of the circuitous route that
334 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
must be followed, their supplies were distant from them. Seizing
the opportunity, and taking advantage of the opening that
fell to him, Saladin schemed an incursion on their country.
Unexpectedly he arrived at the city of Nablus and attacked
it with his soldiers and took it. He took prisoner all within it,
and seized with it fortified places and villages. The hands of
the Muslims were filled with prisoners beyond number, both
Franks and a sect of the Jews known as al-Samarah [Samaritans]
descended from al-Samiri [Koran XX, 87]. Large numbers were
put to a speedy death, and the Muslims acquired plunder it is
not possible to estimate, with all the goods, provisions, baggage,
furnitures, cattle and horses, and such-like. The victorious Sultan
allowed the Muslims to take what they could, and conceded
it to them. Each hand held what it gained, and became rich
and prosperous. The army erased all traces of the Frankish lands
through which it passed, returning victorious, with booty and
in safety. Many Muslim prisoners they had also freed. It was
a raid the like of which had not been heard of in the land.133
We left Damascus when the foremost Muslims had already
come, each bearing the booty he had laid his hands on. The
prisoners tallied thousands, and their number we could not
ascertain. The Sultan reached Damascus the first Saturday after
our departure, and we learnt that he will rest his soldiers
a little and then return to the fortress of Kerak. May God assist
him, and in His power and glory, cause it to fall to him. We
ourselves went forth to Frankish lands at a time when Frankish
prisoners were entering Muslim lands. Let this be evidence
enough to you of the temperateness of the policy of Saladin.
We passed the night of Friday in Darayah, a village belonging
to Damascus, and a parasang and a half from it. We removed
from there at daybreak on Friday to a village called Bait Jann,
which lies amongst the hills. Thence we left, on the morning
of Saturday, for the city of Banyas. Halfway on the road, we
came upon an oak-tree of great proportions and with widespreading
branches. We learnt that it is called 'The Tree of
Measure', and when we enquired concerning it, we were told
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 335
that it was the boundary on this road between security and
danger, by reason of some Frankish brigands who prowl and
rob thereon. He whom they seize on the Muslim side, be it
by the length of the arms or a span, they capture; but he whom
they seize on the Frankish side at a like distance, they release.
This is a pact they faithfully observe and is one of the most
pleasing and singular conventions of the Franks.
A note on the city of Banyas [Belinas]
God Most High defend it
This city is on the frontier of the Muslim territories. It is
small, but has a fortress below the walls of which winds a river
that flows out from one of the gates of the city. A canal leading
from it turns the mills. The city had been in the hands of the
Franks, but Nur al-Din - may God's mercy rest upon his soul
-recovered it [in 1165]. It has a* wide tillage in a contiguous
vale. It is commanded by a fortress of the Franks called Hunin*
three parasangs distant from Banyas. The cultivation of the vale
is divided between the Franks and the Muslims, and in it there
is a boundary known as 'The Boundary of Dividing'. They
apportion the crops equally, and their animals are mingled
together, yet no wrong takes place between them because of it.
We departed from Banyas on the evening of the same Saturday
for a village called al-Masiyah, near to the Frankish fort
we have mentioned. We passed the night in it, and removed
on Sunday at daybreak. Between Hunin and Tibnin we passed
a valley thick with trees, most of which were bay. The valley
was of great depth, like a deep ravine whose sides come together
and whose heights reach to the skies. It is known as al-Astil.
Should soldiers penetrate it, they would be lost, there being
no refuge or escape for them from the hand of those that lay
in wait for them. Its descent and ascent, on both sides, is toilsome.
Marvelling at the place, we passed it, travelling close
beside, and came to one of the biggest fortresses of the Franks,
*Chastian Neuf.
33^ THE TRAVELS OF IBN
called Tibnin. At this place customs dues are levied on the caravans.
It belongs to the sow known as Queen134 who is the
mother of the pig who is the Lord of Acre - may God destroy it.
We camped at the foot of this fortress. The fullest tax was
not exacted from us, the payment being a Tyrian dinar and
a qirat [one-twentieth part] of a dinar [about eleven shillings]
for each head. No toll was laid upon the merchants, since they
were bound for the place of the accursed King [Acre], where
the tithe is gathered.135 The tax there is a qirat in every dinar
(worth of merchandise), the dinar having twenty-four qirat.138
The greater part of those taxed were Maghribis, those from
all other Muslim lands being unmolested. This was because
some earlier Maghribis had annoyed the Franks. A gallant company
of them had attacked one of their strongholds with Nur
al-Din - may God have mercy upon him - and by its taking
they had become manifestly rich and famous. The Franks
punished them by this tax, and their chiefs enforced it. Every
Maghribi therefore paid this dinar for his hostility to their
country. The Franks declared: 'These Maghribis came and went
in our country and we treated them well and took nothing
from them. But when they interfered in the war, joining with
their brother Muslims against us, we were compelled to place
this tax upon them.' In the payment of this tax, the Maghribis
are pleasingly reminded of their vexing of the enemy, and thus
the payment of it is lightened and its harshness made tolerable.
We moved from Tibnin - may God destroy it - at daybreak
on Monday. Our way lay through continuous farms and
ordered settlements, whose inhabitants were all Muslims, living
comfortably with the Franks. God protect us from such temptation.
They surrender half their crops to the Franks at harvest
time, and pay as well a poll-tax of one dinar and five qirat for
each person. Other than that, they are not interfered with, save
for a light tax on the fruits of trees. Their houses and all their
effects are left to their full possession. All the coastal cities
occupied by the Franks are managed in this fashion, their rural
districts, the villages and farms, belonging to the Muslims. But
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 337
their hearts have been seduced, for they observe how unlike
them in ease and comfort are their brethren in the Muslim
regions under their (Muslim) governors. This is one of the misfortunes
afflicting the Muslims. The Muslim community bewails
the injustice of a landlord of its own faith, and applauds the
conduct of its opponent and enemy, the Frankish landlord, and
is accustomed to justice from him.137 He who laments this state
must turn to God. There is comfort and consolation enough
for us in the exalted Book: 'It is nothing but a trial; Thou
makest to err with it whom Thou pleasest, and guidest whom
Thou pleasest' [Koran VII, 155].
On the same Monday, we alighted at a farmstead a parasang
distant from Acre. Its headman is a Muslim, appointed by the
Franks to oversee the Muslim workers in it. He gave generous
hospitality to all members of the caravan, assembling them,
great and small, in a large room in his house, and giving them
a variety of foods and treating all with liberality. We were
amongst those who attended this party, and passed the night
there. On the morning of Tuesday the 10th of the month,
•which was the 18th of September, we came to the city of Acre
- may God destroy it. We were taken to the custom-house,
which is a khan prepared to accommodate the caravan. Before
the door are stone benches, spread with carpets, where are the
Christian clerks of the Customs with their ebony ink-stands
ornamented with gold. They write Arabic, which they also
speak. Their chief is the Sahib al-Diwan [Chief of the Customs],
who holds the contract to farm the customs. He is known as
al-Sahib [the Director or Master], a title bestowed on him by
reason of his office, and which they apply to all respected persons,
save the soldiery, who hold office with them. All the dues
collected go to the contractor for the customs, who pays a vast
sum (to the Government). The merchants deposited their baggage
there and lodged in the upper storey. The baggage of
any who had no merchandise was also examined in case it contained
concealed (and dutiable) merchandise, after which the
owner was permitted to go his way and seek lodging where
338 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
he would. All this was done with civility and respect, and without
harshness and unfairness. We lodged beside the sea in a
house which we rented from a Christian woman, and prayed
God Most High to save us from all dangers and help us to
security.
A note on the city of Acre
May God exterminate (the Christians in) it and restore it (to the Muslims)
Acre is the capital of the Frankish cities in Syria, the unloading
place of'ships reared aloft in the seas like mountains' [Koran
LV, 24], and a port of call for all ships. In its greatness it
resembles Constantinople. It is the focus of ships and caravans,
and the meeting-place of Muslim and Christian merchants from
all regions. Its roads and streets are choked by the press of men,
so that it is hard to put foot to ground. Unbelief and unpiousness
there bum fiercely, and pigs [Christians] and crosses
abound. It stinks and is filthy, being full of refuse and excrement.
The Franks ravished it from Muslim hands in the first
[last] decade of the sixth [fifth] century,138 and the eyes of
Islam were swollen with weeping for it; it was one of its
griefs. Mosques became churches and minarets bell-towers,
but God kept undefiled one part of the principal mosque,
which remained in the hands of the Muslims as a small mosque
where strangers could congregate to offer the obligatory
prayers. Near its mihrab is the tomb of the prophet Salih -
God bless and preserve him. and all the prophets. God protected
this part (of the mosque) from desecration by the unbelievers
for the benign influence of this holy tomb.
To the east of the town is the spring called 'Ayn al-Baqar
[the Spring of the Cattle], from which God brought forth the
cattle for Adam139 - may God bless and preserve him. The
descent to this spring is by a deep stairway. Over it is a mosque
of which there remains in its former state only the mihrab,
to the east of which the Franks have built their own mihrab;
and Muslim and infidel assemble there, the one turning to his
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 339
place of worship, the other to his. In the hands of the Christians
its venerableness is maintained, and God has preserved in it a
place of prayer for the Muslims.
Two days we tarried at this place, and then, on Thursday
the 12th of Jumada, corresponding with the 20th of September,
we set forth across country to Sur [Tyre]. On our way we
passed by a great fortress called al-Zab [al-Zib or Casal Imbert]
which dominates the continuous villages and farms, and by a
walled town called Iskandarunah [Iscandelion]. We sought a
ship which we had learnt was bound for Bijayah [Bougie] and
on which we wished to embark. And so we alighted at this
town on the evening of that same Thursday, for the distance
between the two cities (of Acre and Tyre) is thirty miles. We
lodged in a khan in the town prepared for the reception of
pilgrims.
A note on the city of Sur [Tyre]
May God Most High destroy it
This city has come proverbial for its impregnability, and he
who seeks to conquer it will meet with no surrender or humility.
The Franks prepared it as a refuge in case of unforeseen emergency,
making it a strong point for their safety. Its roads and
streets are cleaner than those of Acre. Its people are by disposition
less stubborn in their unbelief, and by nature and habit
they are kinder to the Muslim stranger. Their manners, in other
words, are gentler. Their dwellings are larger and more spacious.
The state of the Muslims in this city is easier and more peaceful.
Acre is a town at once bigger, more impious, and more unbelieving.
But the strength and impregnability of Tyre is more
marvellous than is told of. It has only two gates, one landwards,
and the other on the sea, which encompasses the city save on
one side. The landward gate is reached only after passing
through three or four posterns in the strongly-fortified outer
walls that enclose it. The seaward gate is flanked by two
strong towers and leads into a harbour whose remarkable
340 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
situation is unique among maritime cities. The walls of the
city enclose it on three sides, and. the fourth is confined by
a mole bound with cement. Ships enter below the walls and
there anchor. Between the two towers stretches a great chain
which, when raised, prevents any coming in or going forth,
and no ships may pass save when it is lowered. At the gate
stand guards and trusted watchers, and none can enter or go
forth save under their eyes. The beauty of the site of this port
is truly wonderful. Acre resembles it in situation and description,
but cannot take the large ships, which must anchor outside,
small ships only being able to enter. The port of Tyre
is more complete, more beautiful, and more animated. Eleven
days we tarried in the city, entering it on Thursday, and leaving
it on Sunday the 22nd of Jumada, which was the last day
of September; this was because the ship in which we had hoped
to sail we found to be too small, so that we were unwilling
to set forth in it.
An alluring worldly spectacle deserving of record was a
nuptial procession which we witnessed one day near the port
in Tyre. All the Christians, men and women, had assembled,
and were formed in two lines at the bride's door. Trumpets,
flutes, and all the musical instruments,140 were played until she
proudly emerged between two men who held her right and
left as though they were her kindred. She was most elegantly
garbed in a beautiful dress from which trailed, according to
their traditional style, a long train of golden silk. On her head
she wore a golden diadem covered by a net of woven gold,
and on her breast was a like arrangement. Proud she was in
her ornaments and dress, walking with little steps of half a span,
like a dove, or in the manner of a wisp of cloud. God protect
us from the seduction of the sight. Before her went Christian
notables in their finest and most splendid clothing, their trains
falling behind them. Behind her were her peers and equals of
the Christian women, parading in their richest apparel and
proud of bearing in their superb ornaments. Leading them all
were the musical instruments. The Muslims and other Christian
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 341
onlookers formed two ranks along the route, and gazed on
them without reproof. So they passed along until they brought
her to the house of the groom; and all that day they feasted.
We thus were given the chance of seeing this alluring sight,
from the seducement of which God preserve us.
We then returned by sea to Acre and landed there on the
morning of Monday the 23 rd of Jumada, being the first day
in October. We hired passages on a large ship, about to sail
to Messina on the island of Sicily. My God Most High, in His
power and strength, assure the easing and lightening (of our
way).
During our stay in Tyre we rested in one of the mosques
that remained in Muslim hands. One of the Muslim elders of
Tyre told us that it had been wrested from them in the year
518 [27th of June, 1124], and that Acre had been taken twelve
[actually twenty] years earlier [24th of March, 1104], after a
long siege and after hunger had overcome them. We were told
that it had brought them to such a pass - we take refuge in
God from it - that shame had driven them to propose a course
from which God had preserved them. They had determined
to gather their wives and children into the Great Mosque and
there put them to the sword, rather than that the Christians
should possess them. They themselves would then sally forth
determinedly, and in a violent assault on the enemy, die
together. But God made His irreversible decree, and their
jurisprudents and some of their godly men prevented them.
They thereupon decided to abandon the town, and to make
good their escape. So it happened, and they dispersed among
the Muslim lands. But there were some whose love of native
land impelled them to return and, under the conditions of a
safegusxd which was written for them, to live amongst the
infidels, 'God is the master of His affair' [Koran XII, 21].
Glorious is God, and great is His power. His will overcomes
all impediments.
There can be no excuse in the eyes of God for a Muslim to
stay in any infidel country, save when passing through it, while
w
342 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
the way lies clear in Muslim lands. They will face pains and
terrors such as the abasement and destitution of the capitation
and more especially, amongst their base and lower orders, the
hearing of what will distress the heart in the reviling of him
[Muhammad] whose memory God has sanctified, and whose
rank He has exalted; there is also the absence of cleanliness,
the mixing with the pigs, and all the other prohibited matters
too numerous to be related or enumerated. Beware, beware
of entering their lands. May God Most High grant His beneficent
indulgence for this sin into which (our) feet have slipped,
but His forgiveness is not given save after accepting our penitence.
Glory to God, the Master. There is no Lord but He.
Among the misfortunes that one who visits their land will
see are the Muslim prisoners walking in shackles and put to
painful labour like slaves. In like condition are the Muslim
women prisoners, their legs in iron rings. Hearts are rent for
them, but compassion avails them nothing.
One of the beneficent works of God Most High towards
the Maghrib prisoners in these lands of Frankish Syria is that
every Muslim of these parts of Syria or elsewhere who makes
a will in respect of his property devotes it to the liberation of
the Maghribis in particular because of their remoteness from
their native land and because, after Great and Glorious God,
they have no other to deliver them. They are strangers, cut
off from their native land, and the Muslim kings of these parts,
the royal ladies, and the persons of ease and wealth, spend their
money only in this cause. Nur al-Din - God have mercy on
him-during an illness which had struck him, swore to distribute
twelve thousand dinars for the ransoming of Maghribi
prisoners. When he was cured of his sickness, he sent their
ransom, but with them were despatched a group who were
not Maghribis, but who were from Hamah, one of his provinces.
He ordered their return and the release of Maghribis
in their place, saying, 'These men can be ransomed by their
kindred and their neighbours; but the Maghribis are strangers
and have no kindred (here).'
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 343
Consider now the beneficent work of God Most High
towards these Maghrib people. He decreed that they should
have in Damascus two of the most considerable and wealthy
merchants, who were deep in riches. One was named Nasr ibn
Qawam and the other Abu 1-Durr Yaqut, lord of al-'Attafi.
Their business is all along this Frankish coast, and there is
mention of no one else but them. They have agents who take
a share in the profits. Their caravans come and go with their
merchandise and stores, bringing great riches; and their influence
over the Muslim and Frankish princes is great. Great and
Glorious God assigned to them the part of ransoming the
Maghribi prisoners with their wealth and that of the bequeathments;
for these are made in their name on account of the
fame of their probity and integrity and the vast sums of their
own wealth that they have spent in this cause. No Maghribi
can secure release from captivity save at their hands, and for
a long time they have been prodigal of their wealth and efforts
in releasing God's servants the Muslims from the hands of His
enemies the infidels. May God Most High not fail to reward
those who perform these righteous deeds.
By an unhappy chance, from the evils of which we take
refuge in God, we were accompanied on our road to Acre
from Damascus by a Maghribi from Buna in the district of
Bougie who had been a prisoner and had been released by the
agency of Abu '1-Durr and become one of his young men.
In one of his patron's caravans he had come to Acre, where
he had mixed with the Christians, and taken on much of their
character. The devil increasingly seduced and incited him until
he renounced the faith of Islam, turned unbeliever, and became
a Christian in the time of our stay in Tyre. We left to Acre,
but received news of him. He had been baptised and become
unclean, and had put on the girdle of a monk, thereby hastening
for himself the flames of hell, verifying the threats of torture,
and exposing himself to a grievous account and a longdistant
return (from hell). We beg Great and Glorious God
to confirm us in the true word in this world and the next,
344 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
allowing us not to deviate from the pure faith and letting us,
in His grace and mercy, die Muslims.
This pig, the lord of Acre whom they call king, lives secluded
and is not seen, for God has afflicted him with leprosy.1*1 God
was not slow to vengeance, for the affliction seized him in his
youth, depriving him of the joys of his world. He is wretched
here, 'but the chastisement of the hereafter is severer and more
lasting' [Koran XX, 127]. His chamberlain and regent is his
maternal uncle, the Count, the controller of the Treasury to
whom the revenues are paid, and who supervises all with
firmness and authority. The most considerable amongst the accursed
Franks is the accursed Count, the lord of Tripoli and
Tiberias.142 He has authority and position among them. He is
qualified to be king, and indeed is a candidate for the office.
He is described as being shrewd and crafty. He was a prisoner
of Nur al-Din's for twelve years or more, and then ransomed
himself by the payment of a great sum in the time of the first
governorship of Saladin, to whom he admits his vassalage and
emancipation.
The caravans from Damascus branch away through the territory
of Tiberias because its road is smooth, but mule caravans
go through Tibnin, which road although rough is direct. The
lake of Tiberias is sweet. Its breadth is four or five parasangs,
and although statements about its length vary, the nearest to
the truth is that it is about six parasangs, albeit we did not see
it. There is a dispute as well about the width. In Tiberias there
are the tombs of many prophets - God's blessings upon them -
such as those of Shu'ayb, Sulayman, Yahuda, Rubil, Shu'ayb's
daughter the wife of Moses the Interlocutor, and others -
God's blessings upon them all. Nearby is Jabal al-Tur [Tabor].
Between Acre and Bait al-Maqdis [Jerusalem] lies three days'
journey, and between Damascus and Jerusalem eight. Jerusalem
is to the south-west143 of Acre in the direction of Alexandria.
May God restore it to the Muslims, and cleanse it, by His
strength and power, from the hands of the polytheists [the
believers in the Trinity].
THE MONTH OF JUMADA 'L-AKHIRAH (580) 345
The cities of Acre and Tyre have no gardens around them,
and stand in a wide plain that reaches to the shores of the sea.
Fruits are brought to them from the orchards that are in the
neighbourhood. They possess broad lands and the nearby mountains
are furnished with farmsteads from which fruits are
brought to them. They are very rich cities. At the eastern
extremity of Acre is a torrent course, along the banks of which
extending to the sea is a sandy plain, than which I have seen
no more beautiful sight. As a course for horses there is none
to compare with it. Every morning and evening the Lord of
the town rides over it, and there the soldiers parade - destroy
them, God. Beside Tyre's landward gate is a fresh spring down
to which a stairway leads. The wells and cisterns of the town
are many, and there is no house without one. May God Most
High, in His grace and favour, restore to it and to its sister
(cities) the word of Islam.
On Saturday the 28th of Jumada, being the 6th of October,
with the favour of God towards the Muslims, we embarked
on a large ship, taking water and provisions. The Muslims
secured places apart from the Franks. Some Christians called
'bilghriyin' [from the Italian pe//egn'm'=pilgrims] came aboard.
They had been on the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and were too
numerous to count, but were more than two thousand. May
God in His grace and favour soon relieve us of their company
and bring us to safety with His hoped-for assistance and beneficent
works; none but He should be worshipped. So, under the
will of Great and Glorious God, we awaited a favouring wind
and the completion of the ship's stowing.
The Month of Rajah the Unique (580)
[8th of October-6th of November, 1184]
May God let us know His grace and favour
THE new moon rose on the night of Tuesday, corresponding
with the 9th of October, while we were aboard the
ship in the port of Acre, awaiting the completion of the stowing
and our sailing in the name of God Most High with His
favour and beneficent indulgence and by His generous will.
Our stay there was prolonged twelve days, through the failure
of the wind to rise. The blowing of the winds in these parts
has a singular secret. It is that the east wind does not blow
except in spring and autumn, and, save at those seasons, no
voyages can be made and merchants will not bring their goods
to Acre. The spring voyages begin in the middle of April,
when the east wind blows until the end of May. It may last
longer or less according to what God Most High decrees. The
autumn voyages are from the middle of October, when the
east wind (again) sets in motion. It lasts a shorter time than
in the spring, and is for them a fleeting opportunity, for it
blows for (only) fifteen days, more or less. There is no other
suitable time, for the winds then vary, that from the west prevailing.
Voyagers to the Maghrib, to Sicily, or to the lands of
the Rum, await this east wind in these two seasons as they
would await (the fulfdment of) an honest pledge. Glory to
God, creating in His wisdom, and miraculous in His power.
There is no God but He.
During all this time that we were on the ship, we passed
the nights ashore and sometimes had to search for our vessel.
When therefore at daybreak of Thursday the ioth of Rajab,
the 18th of October, the ship set sail, we, according to our
habit, were ashore passing the night. The day was not fair for
the Rum to prepare for the sea, and we had lost our prudence
THE MONTH OF RAJAB THE UNIQUE (580) 347
and forgotten the proverb concerning the preparation of water
and provisions, 'A man should not leave his saddle'. So when
we came to morning we could not see the ship, nor was there
any trace of it. At once we hired a large boat with four oars
and put off to follow the ship. It was most perilous, but God
preserved us, and we overtook the ship at eventide, praising
Great and Glorious God for His benefits. The beginning of
that day was the distressful part of this long voyage, but its
end, God be praised, brought comfort. In all circumstances,
let us praise and render gratitude to God. Steadily we sailed
on, under a propitious wind of varying force, for five days.
Then the west wind came out of ambuscade and blew into
the ship's bows. The captain and ruler of the ship, a Genoese
Rumi, who was perspicacious in his art and skilled in the duties
of a sea-captain, made shift to elude this wind by tacking right
and left, and sought to return not on his tracks. The sea was
calm, and gentle. At midnight, or near to it, on the night of
Saturday the 19th of Rajab, being the 27th of October, the
west wind fell on us and broke a spar of the mast known as
the 'ardimun' [Italian, artimone],lii throwing half of it, with
the attaching sails, into the sea. God saved us from its falling
on the ship, for in size and bulk it resembled a mast. The
mariners hastened forward and lowered the sail on the mainmast,
stopping the ship's progress. The sailors needed for the
long-boat tied to the ship were called, and they pulled to the
half-spar and its sails that had fallen into the sea and brought
them out. We were delivered from a state which only God
Most High can know of. They began to raise the main-sail,
and on the artimone set a sail called the 'dallun' [Gr., 6oAcov].X45
We spent a grey night until the dawn gleamed. Great and
Glorious God had granted us security. The mariners began to
fashion another spar from some wood which they had ready.
But the west wind was at the beginning of its perversity, and
we wavered between hope and despair; yet there triumphed
our faith in the beneficent offices of God Most High and in
His hidden favour and known grace. Glory to Him for He is
348 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
worthy of it; great is His power and exalted is His majesty.
There is no God but He.
On Wednesday the 23rd of the month the east wind blew:
gently, languidly, and mildly; and our spirits rejoiced, for we
hoped it would increase and grow stronger; but it was a dying
breath. A thin mist then veiled the sea, whose waves were
calmed so that it became like a 'palace made smooth with glass'
[Koran XXVII, 44]. In all four quarters there scarce was air
to breathe. So we remained, playing on the surface of the
water, which seemed to the eye to be a sheet of molten silver;
or we might be wandering between two sides. This is the wind
the sailors call the 'ghalini' [Gr., ycxAT)vr| = calmness].
The night of Thursday the 24th of Rajab, the 1st of November
according to the non-Arabs, was a festival for the Christians,
and they celebrated it with lighted candles. Hardly one of them,
big or little, male or female, but carried a candle in his hand.
Their priests led them in prayers on the ship, then one by one
rose to preach a sermon and recall the articles of their faith.
The whole ship, from top to bottom, was luminous with
kindled lamps. In this manner we passed most of that night,
and when we came to the morn, the same still wind was with
us, and remained until the night of Sunday the 27th of the
month. A north wind then rose, the ship resumed its course,
and our spirits were cheered. Praise be to God.
The Month of Sha'ban the Honoured (580)
[7th of November-5th of December, 1184]
May God let us know His benignity
THE new moon was obscured to us, and we reckoned that
the days of Rajab were completed on the night of Thursday
the 8th of November. From the time of our sailing from
Acre, we had been twenty-two days on the sea, and therefore
were wanting in felicity and felt only wretchedness and despair.
But we hoped for the benign offices of Great and Glorious
God, and for His unrevealed bounty, which by His grace and
favour, is vouched unto us. The provisions of the travellers
were becoming scarce, but by the charity of God in this ship
they were as if in a city filled with all commodities. All they
might wish to buy could be found: bread, water, and all kinds
of fruit and victuals, such as pomegranate, quince, water-melon,
pear, chestnut, walnut, chick-pea, broad-bean raw and cooked,
onion, garlic, fig, cheese, fish and many other things it would
be too long to describe. All this we saw being sold. Throughout
all these days we had seen no land - may God soon dispel
our cares - and two Muslims died - God have mercy on them.
They were thrown into the sea. Of the (Christian) pilgrims
two died also, and then were followed by many. One of them
fell alive into the sea, and the waves carried him off more
quickly than a flash of Hghtning. The captain of the ship
inherited the effects of the departed Mushms and Christian
pilgrims, for such is their usage for all who die at sea. There
is no way for the (true) heir of the dead to gain his inheritance,
and at this we were much astonished.
At daybreak on Tuesday the 6th of the month, the 13 th of
November, mountains appeared to us out of the sea. The west
wind had mounted and blew fiercely and without intermission;
then the wind blew changingly from east and west, and drove
350 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
us to one of those mountains, and we anchored beside it. We
asked concerning the place, and learnt that it was one of the
(Eastern) Roman islands [of the Greek archipelago]. There are
more than three hundred and fifty of these islands and they
are under the governance of the ruler of Constantinople. The
Rum are as wary of the inhabitants of these islands as they
are of the Muslims, for no amity exists between them. "We
remained in the anchorage all that Tuesday, and the beginning
of Wednesday. Some people from the island, after obtaining
a safe-conduct, came to the ship, and for a few hours sold bread
and meat to those upon it.
On Wednesday we put to sea, having been on board the
ship for eight and twenty days. The following Thursday there
appeared to us the island of Crete. This island is also under the
sovereignty of the ruler of Constantinople. It is more than
three hundred miles long, and we have previously mentioned
it on our sea-journey to Alexandria. Along its length we journeyed,
having it to our right. All the way the sea was agitated
and the wind unfavourable, while with proper resignation we
awaited relief from Great and Glorious God, and expected -
exalted is His majesty-that by His grace and favour, we
should receive His covenanted aid and easement.
On Saturday the ioth of Sha'ban, which was the 17th of
November, we parted from the coast of Crete, and made speed
under a favourable north wind. It roared and blew so that the
ship flew on its wings the sails. The sea became possessed of
the devil and was greatly commoted. Its waves surged and
foamed, so that their raging crests we conceived to be snowy
mountains. Our spirits were yet gladdened, and hope triumphed
over despair.
During the twenty-six days in which we had not seen land,
we had made conjectures, and talked soothingly of death for
fear that we should exhaust our provisions and water, and come
upon the twin disasters, hunger and thirst. Some said that we
had strayed on our course towards the Gharb coast of Africa
and others thought that we had diverged to the mainland of
THE MONTH OF SHA'BAN THE HONOURED (580) 3JI
the territory of Constantinople and its vicinity; still others said
Lattakiyah in Syria, and others Damietta on the coast of Alexandria.
We were fearful that the wind would drive us to one
of the desert islands of (Eastern) Rome and there we would
have to winter, or even be forced by the situation to live in
one of its houses. In none of the prospects was there any happy
choice until God should bring us relief and remove our sadness
and despair, fortifying our spirits after the hardships we
had suffered and the afflictions we had endured. His abundance
comes from God, who says:
'The sea is bitter of taste, intractable:
No need of it have I.
Is it not water and we earth?
Why then do we endure it?'1*6
Now, by the grace of God Most High, we may bend our
looks for the happy sight, if God wills, of the coast of Sicily.
At midnight on Sunday the nth, the wind changed to the
west and brought on us the tempest from that side. Strongly
the wind blew and took us northward. On the morning of
Sunday the storm had increased, and the sea was raging, throwing
up waves like mountains. They struck the ship such blows
that, with all its size, it tossed like a tender twig. It was as
high as the walls of a city, yet the waves reared up and flung
into its midst a shower of water like drenching rain. With the
darkening night the buffeting increased and our ears were
smitten by the bellowing. The fury of the wind became a
grave affair; the sails were lowered and only the small dallun
were left, at half-mast. Despair of this world fell upon us, and
we bade life farewell in peace. Waves came upon us from all
sides and we thought we were destroyed. O night on which
sable locks would go grey, recorded amongst the grey nights
and first in the number of our adventures and misfortunes.
Long for us was that night, long like the night of Sul.147
Morning had scarcely come when to our misfortune we saw
the coast of Crete on our left. Its mountains had (earlier) been
352. THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
before us, and we had left them behind to our right. But the
wind had taken us from our course, and we who had thought
to have passed it were mistaken. We had gone astray from
the known and auspicious way whereby the coast of Crete
should have been on our right when facing Sicily. We submitted
ourselves to fate, and swallowing our chokings at this
vexation, said:
'He whose wants are satisfied, will either curse or repine.'
Meanwhile the sun had brightened, and the sea had somewhat
settled, and we stood constant to our aim of anchoring
on that coast until God should fulfil His decrees and execute
His judgement. All (modes of) travel have their (proper)
season, and travel by sea should be at the propitious time and
the recognised period. There should not be a reckless venturing
forth in the months of winter as we did. First and last the
matter is in the hands of God; but beware, beware of embarking
on such hazards; although caution is useless in the face of
destiny. God is sufficient unto us and the best protector.
When we were off the coast, the wind helped us a little so
that we drew away from it and left it on our right. We returned
near to our intended course, and made progress part of the
night of Tuesday the 13 th. We had been on the ship thirtyfour
days. The sails were set 'musallabah' [square-rigged],
which the Rum deem to be the best method of sailing, since
they cannot but catch the wind which comes aft of the ship
on its course [see note 132]. On the morning of Tuesday we
found the same conditions, with the wind helping us, wherefore
we rejoiced and were glad. There then appeared ships
sailing in our direction, and we were enlivened to know that
we were on the course intended. Praise and thanks to God in
all conjunctures. The wind then changed, and blew from the
west with violence. After taking us along part of Wednesday
night and Wednesday itself, it drove us despite ourselves to
a harbour at the tip of one of the Rumani [Greek] islands
[Zante?]. A strait of twelve miles separates it from the mainland.
We arrived at this place on the morning of Thursday
THE MONTH OF SHA'BAN THE HONOURED (580) 353
the 15th of Sha'ban the Honoured, being the 22nd of November.
Praise be to Great and Glorious God for the safety He has
granted us. There followed us to the harbour five ships, two
of which had sailed from the coast of Alexandria about fifty
days before but had been taken astray by the wind. Four days
we tarried in that harbour, and our people renewed their water
and provisions, for the habitations were at hand. The islanders
came and to people on the ship sold bread, meat, oil, and whatever
victuals they had. Their bread was not of wheat entirely,
but was mixed with barley and baked to blackness. People
rushed for it, despite its dearness - and indeed there was nothing
cheap for sale - and thanked God for what He had granted.
When in this harbour, we had been forty days on board. Praise
be to God in all conjunctures. During our stay in it the west
wind abated not at all, but blew as violently as possible. Praise
be to God Most High that it did not find us moving on the
high seas. Praise be to God for His benign offices.
We sailed from this harbour on Tuesday the 19th of Sha'ban,
the 26';h of November, under a good and favourable wind,
rejoicing at it, and perceiving the beneficent work of Great
and Glorious God, and the benevolence of His decrees. There
is no God but He. We continued on our way until Thursday
the 22nd of Sha'ban, the 29th of November, when the wind
changed and blew from the west. A cloud rose with crashing
thunder, driven by a furious wind and preceded by dazzling
Hghtning. On to us in the ship it poured a continuous shower
of hail that dismayed our spirits; but soon it was over and our
disquiet was relieved. But the night of Friday we passed in
desolation; and despair in its lurking hole was revealed to us.
Then when dawn shone and daylight came, we saw the coast
of Sicily before us. Oh joyous news; may if be that adversity
return not again.
By right-time on Saturday the 1st day of December, we
were less than a third or half the way from the coast. But every
ending is already recorded and settled (by destiny). How many
hopes does misfortune pass by? There was not a moment before
354 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
a wind struck in our faces and drove us back. It stopped our
eyes from seeing and continued to rage so that it nearly broke
and shattered the (ship's) wood. The sails were lowered from
the mast, and placing our souls in the care of their Creator,
we stopped on our course. Rain clouds chased after us; and
they and the night and the sea threw us into a threefold
obscurity. The swollen waves beat incessantly upon us, their
shocks making the heart to leap. Our souls threw away all
desires and prepared to meet Fate. That tenebrous night we
passed under the blows of the tempest, suffering terror, and
enduring vicissitudes, oh what vicissitudes! On the morning
of Saturday we came upon a violent day which multiplied the
miseries of the night. The wind and the waves threw us where
they willed, and we resigned ourselves to fate, grasping tenaciously
at our hopes (of the life to come). Then at eventide
we were overtaken by the favour of God Most High, when
the wind softened, the sea calmed, and the face of the sky
blazed bright. By the morning of Sunday the 2nd of December,
the 25th of Sha'ban, our despair had changed to confidence,
and men's faces stared about as if they had but risen from the
shroud. The wind helped us a little, and we looked again for
any trace of land in sight, and made conjectures as to where
and when. Great and Glorious God is truly good to those who
worship Him, and secures us with His known gracious favour
and habit. There is no God but He.
The Month of Ramadan the Venerated (580)
[6th of December, 1184.-4.tl1 of January, 1185]
May God in His grace and favour let us share His blessings and during
it accept our prayers. There is no Lord but He
THE new moon rose on the night of Friday the 7th of
December while we were going back and forth off the
mainland [Italy]. God granted us a light east wind by which
we travelled gently on until we came to this place opposite
the mainland. Here we observed many farms and habitations,
and learnt that it was part of Calabria and belongs to the Lord
of Sicily, for his territories on the mainland extend two months'
(journey) from this place. Many of the (Christian) pilgrims
went ashore to escape the hunger that had smitten those on
the ship, our provisions being exhausted. It is enough to tell
you that we made do with a ritl [5 lb.] of dried biscuit which
we divided amongst four of us and moistened with a little
water. "With this we were content. Every pilgrim who landed
sold what remained of his provisions, and the Muslims, in sympathy
with fellow travellers, bought what they could, despite
the dearness which reached a dirham of pure (silver) for a biscuit.
What think you of a voyage of two months on board
a ship over a distance we had thought to cross in ten or fifteen
days at most. The prudent was he who brought victuals for
thirty days, but the rest brought enough for only twenty or
fifteen. A singular circumstance of our sea journey was that
while on board we had seen the new moon of three months:
Rajab, Sha'ban, and Ramadan the present month.
On the morning of the 1st day of this month we observed
before us the Mountain of Fire, the famous volcano of Sicily,
and rejoiced thereat. May God Most High reward us for what
we have endured, and end (our days) with the best and most
356 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
magnificent of His favours. May He animate us in all circumstances
to gratitude for what He has bestowed on us. A favourable
wind then moved us from that place, but on the evening
of Saturday the 2nd of the month its force increased and drove
the ship with such speed that in but an instant it had brought
us to the mouth of the strait. Night had fallen. In this strait the
sea is confined to a width of six miles and in the narrowest
place to three. The sea in this strait, which runs between the
mainland and the island of Sicily, pours through like the 'bursting
of the dam'148 and, from the intensity of the contraction
and the pressure, boils like a cauldron. Difficult indeed is its
passage for ships. Our ship continued on its course, driven by
a strong wind from the south, the mainland on our right and
the coast of Sicily on our left.
When it came to midnight on Sunday the 3rd of the blessed
month (of Ramadan), and we were overlooking the city of
Messina, the sudden cries of the sailors gave us the grievous
knowledge that the ship had been driven by the force of the
wind towards one of the shore lines and had struck it. At once
the captain ordered that the sails be lowered, but the sail on
the mast called the 'ardimun' [artimone] would not come down.
All their efforts they exerted on it, but they could do naught
with it, because of the strain of the wind. When they had
laboured in vain, the captain cut it with a knife piece by piece,
hoping to arrest the ship. During this attempt the ship stuck
by its keel to the ground, touching it with its two rudders,
the two shafts by which it steers.149 Dreadful cries were raised
on the ship, and the Last Judgement had come; the break that
has no mending and the great calamity which allows us no
fortitude. The Christians gave themselves over to grief, and
the Muslims submitted themselves to the decree of their Lord,
finding only and clinging and holding fast to the rope of hopefulness
in the life to come. In turn the wind and the waves
buffeted the ship until one of its rudders broke. The captain
then threw out one of the anchors, hoping to take hold with
it, but to no purpose. He cut its rope and left it in the sea.
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (58o] 3„
When we sure that (our time) had come, we braced ourselves
to meet death, and, summoning our resolution to show goodly
patience, awaited the morn or the time of destiny. Cries and
shrieks arose from the women and the infants of the Rum.
All with humbleness submitted themselves (to the will of God),
and 'men were despoiled of their manhood'.160
We, meanwhile, were gazing at the nearby shore in hesitance
between throwing outselves in to swim and awaiting, it might
be, relief with the dawn from God. We formed the resolve to
remain. The sailors lowered the long-boat into the sea to remove
the most important of their men, women, and effects. They
took it one journey to the shore, but were unable to return,
and the waves threw it in pieces on the beach. Despair then
seized our spirits; but while we were suffering these vicissitudes,
dawn shone and aid and succour came from God. We made
certain, of our eyes, and there before us was the city of Messina
less than half a mile away.
We marvelled at the power of Great and Glorious God in
the management of His designs, and said:
'Many are taken off in death upon the threshold of their
house.'
The sun then rose and small boats came out to us. Our cries
had fallen on the city, and the King of Sicily, William himself,
came out with some of his retinue to survey the affair. We made
speed to go down to the boats, but the violence of the waves
would not allow them to reach the ship. We at last descended
into them at the end of the terrible storm. Our deliverance on
to the shore was like that of Abu Nasr from destiny.161 Some
of the chattels belonging to men had been destroyed, but 'they
took comfort that although without plunder, they had returned
in safety'.162 The strangest thing that we were told was that
this Rumi King, when he perceived some needy Muslims staring
from the ship, having not the means to pay for their landing
because the owners of the boats were asking so high a price
for their rescue, enquired, this King, concerning them and,
learning their story, ordered that they be given one hundred
358 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
ruba'i of his coinage in order that they might alight. All the
Muslims thus were saved and cried, 'Praise be to God, Lord
of the Universe.'
The Christians took from the ship all that they had had
therein. The next day the waves had shattered it and thrown
it in pieces on the shore: a lesson to those who saw, and 'a sign
to those who pondered' [Koran XV, 75]. Wonder fell upon
us for our deliverance; and to Great and Glorious God we
renewed our thanks for His beneficent offices and gracious
decrees, and for preserving us from the falling of this fate upon
us on the mainland, or on one of the islands inhabited by the
Rum where, even had we been saved, we should have been
for ever slaves. Help us, Great and Glorious God, to render
thanks for these gifts and favours, and for this merciful solicitude
and compassion. All this is in His power, and it is His
faculty to be kind and beneficent. There is no God but He.
Another sign of the loving-kindness and benevolence of Great
and Glorious God towards us in this disaster was the presence
of this Rumi king. But for that, all within the ship would
have been robbed of everything, or all the Muslims might have
been placed in servitude, for such was their custom. The arrival
of the King at this city was on account of his fleet, which was
being built and which proved a saving mercy to us. Praise be
to God for His avouched and beneficent care. There is no
God but He.
Recollections of the city of Messina in the island of Sicily
May God restore it (to the Muslims)
This city is the mart of the merchant infidels, the focus of
ships from the world over, and thronging always with companies
of travellers by reason of the lowness of prices. But it
is cheerless because of the unbelief, no Muslim being settled
there. Teeming with worshippers of the Cross, it chokes its
inhabitants, and constricts them almost to strangling. It is full
of smells and filth; and churlish too, for the stranger will find
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 359
there no courtesy. Its markets are animated and teeming, and
it has ample commodities to ensure a luxurious life. Your days
and nights in this town you will pass in full security, even
though your countenance, your manners [lit. 'hand'] and your
tongue are strange.
Messina leans against the mountains, the lower slopes of
which adjoin the intrenchments of the town. To its south is
the sea, and its harbour is the most remarkable of maritime
ports, since large ships can come into it from the seas until
they almost touch it. Between them and the shore is thrown
a plank over which men come and go and porters take up the
baggage; thus no boats are needed for loading and unloading
save for ships anchored far out.
You will observe ships ranged along the quay like horses
lined at their pickets or in their stables. This is all because of
the great depth here of the sea which forms the strait, some
three miles wide, that separates the island from the continent.
On the coast opposite to Messina, is the town known as Rayah
[Reggio], the capital of a large province.
This town of Messina is at the extremity of Sicily, an island
having many towns, cultivated places, and hamlets that it would
take long to name. Its length is seven days' journey, and its
width five. On it is the aforementioned volcano, draped in
clouds so high it is, and for ever, summer and winter, covered
by snow.
The prosperity of the island surpasses description. It is enough
to say that it is a daughter of Spain in the extent of its cultivation,
in the luxuriance of its harvests, and in its well-being,
having an abundance of varied produce, and fruits of every
kind and species.
But it is filled with the worshippers of the Cross, who promenade
in its upper districts and live at ease in its sheltered
parts. The Muslims live beside them with their property and
farms. The Christians treat these Muslims well and 'have taken
them to themselves as friends' [Koran XX, 41], but impose on
them a tax to be paid twice yearly, thus taking from them the
360 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
amplitude of living they had been wont to earn from that land.
May Almighty and Glorious God mend their lot, and in His
goodness, make a happy recompense their heritage.
The mountains are covered with plantations bearing apples,
chestnuts and hazel-nuts, pears, and other kinds of fruits. There
are, in Messina, no Muslims save a small number of craftsmen,
so the Muslim stranger there will feel lonely.
The finest town in Sicily and the seat of its sovereign, is
known to the Muslims as al-Madinah, and to the Christians
as Palermo. It has Muslim citizens who possess mosques, and
their own markets, in the many suburbs. The rest of the Muslims
live in the farms (of the island) and in all its villages and
towns, such as Syracuse and others. Al-Madinah al-Kabirah
['the great City' - Palermo], the residence of their King,
"William, is however the biggest and most populous, and
Messina is next. In al-Madinah, God willing, we shall make
our stay; and thence we hope to go to whichever of the western
countries that Great and Glorious God shall at His will determine.
Their King, William, is admirable for his just conduct, and
the use he makes of the industry of the Muslims, and for
choosing eunuch pages who all, or nearly all, concealing their
faith, yet hold firm to the Muslim divine law. He has much
confidence in Muslims, relying on them for his affairs, and the
most important matters, even the supervisor of his kitchen being
a Muslim; and he keeps a band of black Muslim slaves commanded
by a leader chosen from amongst them. His ministers
and chamberlains he appoints from his pages, of whom he has
a great number and who are his public officials and are described
as his courtiers. In them shines the splendour of his realm for
the magnificent clothing and fiery horses they display; and there
is none of them but has his retinue, his servants, and his followers.
This King possesses splendid palaces and elegant gardens,
particularly in the capital of his kingdom, al-Madinah. In
Messina he has a palace, white like a dove, which overlooks
the shore. He has about him a great number of youths and
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 361
handmaidens, and no Christian King is more given up to the
delights of the realm, or more comfort and luxury-loving.
William is engrossed in the pleasures of his land, the arrangement
of its laws, the laying down of procedure, the allocation
of die functions of his chief officials, the enlargement of the
splendour of the realm, and the display of his pomp, in a
manner that resembles the Muslim Kings. His kingdom is very
large. He pays much attention to his (Muslim) physicians and
astrologers, and also takes great care of them. He will even,
when told that a physician or astrologer is passing through his
land, order his detainment, and then provide him with means
of living so that he will forget his native land. May God in
His favour preserve the Muslims from this seduction. The
King's age is about thirty years. May God protect the Muslims
from his hostility and the extension of his power.
One of the remarkable things told of him is that he reads
and writes Arabic.183 We also learnt from one of his personal
servants that his 'alamah1^ is: 'Praise be to God. It is proper
to praise Him.' His father's 'alamah was: 'Praise be to God in
thanks for His beneficence.' The handmaidens and concubines
in his palace are all Muslims. One of the strangest things told
us by this servant, Yahya ibn Fityan, the Embroiderer,166 who
embroidered in gold trie King's clothes, was toat the Frankish
Christian women who came to his palace became Muslims,
converted by these handmaidens. All this they kept secret from
their King.166 Of the good works of these handmaidens there
are astonishing stories.
It was told to us that when a terrifying earthquake167 shook
the island this polytheist [a Muslim would deem William to
be so, since he accepted the dogma of the Trinity] in alarm
ranged round his palace, and heard nothing but cries to God
and His Prophet from his women and pages. At sight of him,
they were overcome with confusion, but he said to them: 'Let
each invoke the God he worships, and those that have faith
shall be comforted.'
The pages, who are the leaders of his state and the managers
362 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
of his affairs, are Muslims, there being none who do not, voluntarily
and for a heavenly reward, fast in the holy month [of
Ramadan], and give alms that they might be nearer to God.
They redeem prisoners and bring up their young ones, arranging
for their marriage and giving them assistance, and doing all
the good they can. All this is done by Great and Almighty God
for the Muslims of this island and is one of the mysteries of
His care for them.
In Messina we met one of their leading and most distinguished
pages called 'Abd al-Massih, whose wish (to see us) had been
conveyed to us. He entertained us with regard and generosity,
and then spoke openly to us, revealing his close-guarded secrets.
He had first looked about his audience-room, and then, in
self-protection, dismissed those servants about him whom he
suspected. He then questioned us about Mecca-may God
hallow it - and about its venerable shrines, and those of Holy
Medina and of Syria. As we told him he melted with longing
and fervour, and asked if we would give him some blessed
token we had brought from Mecca and Medina-may God
hallow them - and begged us not to be sparing of what we
could give him. 'You can boldly display your faith in Islam,'
he said, 'and are successful in your enterprises and thrive, by
God's will, in your commerce. But we must conceal our faith,
and, fearful of our lives, must adhere to the worship of God
and the discharge of our religious duties in secret. We are
bound in the possession of an infidel who has placed on our
necks the noose of bondage. Our whole purpose therefore is
to be blessed by meeting pilgrims such as you, to ask for their
prayers and be happy in what precious objects from the holy
shrines they can give us to serve us as instruments of faith,
and as treasures on our bier (in token of the life to come).'
Our hearts melted in compassion for him, and we prayed that
his end might be happy, and gave him some of our treasures
as he wished. Profusely he expressed his thanks and gratitude,
and told us in confidence of his colleagues the other pages,
who have a notable repute for good works. In the release of
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 363
prisoners they most acquire merit in God's eyes, and all their
servants are of a like temper.
Another singular circumstance concerning these pages is that
when in the presence of their Lord and the hour for prayer is
at hand they will leave the chamber one by one that they might
make their prayers. They sometimes do so in a place where
the eye of their King might follow them, but Almighty and
Glorious God conceals them. They thus continue to labour in
their purpose, covertly advising the Muslims in their unending
struggle for the faith. May God, in His grace, advantage them
and bring them to a happy end.
In Messina, the King has a shipyard containing fleets of
uncountable numbers of ships. He has a similar yard at al-
Madinah [Palermo].
We lodged (in Messina) at an inn, and stayed there nine
days. Then, on the night of Tuesday the 12th of the holy
month (Ramadan) and the 18th of December, we embarked
on a small ship sailing to al-Madinah. We steered close to the
shore, so that we might keep it within sight. God sent us a
light breeze from the east that most pleasantly urged us on our
way. So we sailed along, bending our gaze on the continuous
cultivations and villages, and on the fortresses and strongholds
at the tops of the lofty mountains. To our right we saw nine
islands [Aeolian or Lipari], rising up like lofty mountains in
the sea, close to the shores of Sicily. From two of them [Vulcano
and Stromboli] fire issues unendingly, and we could see the
smoke ascending from them. At the close of night a red flame
appeared, throwing up tongues into the air. It was the celebrated
volcano. We were told that a fiery blast of great violence
bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and makes the
fire. Often a great stone is cast up and thrown into the air by
the force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and
settling at the bottom. This is one of the most remarkable of
stories, and it is true.
As for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal
al-Nar [Mountain of Fire—Etna], it also presents a singular
364 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
feature in that some years a fire pours from it in the manner
of the 'bursting of the dam' [see note 148]. It passes nothing
it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its
surface and then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of
all things for His marvellous creations. There is no God but He.
On the evening of Wednesday following the Tuesday we
have chronicled, we came to the port of Shafludi [Cefalu],
between which and Messina lies a day and a half's sailing.
Recollections of the town of Shafludi [Cefalu] in the island
of Sicily
May God restore it (to the Muslims)
Cefalu is a coastal town, with an ample produce from its
soil and with many commodities, beset with vine and other
trees, and having well-ordered markets. A community of Muslims
lives there. Set over the town is a mountain, on whose
large circular summit is a fortress, than which I have never
seen any more formidable. They hold it in readiness for any
sea attack that a fleet from the lands of the Muslims - may
God render them victorious - might make upon them unawares.
We sailed from Cefalu at midnight, and came to the town
of Thirmah [Termini] in the early forenoon of Thursday, after
an easy voyage. The two towns are five and twenty miles from
each other. At Termini we changed from that ship to another
which we chartered, that the sailors accompanying us might be
of the country (throughjjwhich we should travel).
Recollections of the town of Thirmah [Termini] in the
island of Sicily
May God deliver it (to the Muslims)
Better situated than the place we have just described, this
town is strongly fortified, and surmounts and towers above
the sea. The Muslims have a large suburb, in which are their
mosques. The town has a high and impregnable fort, and in
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 365
its lower part is a thermal spring which serves the citizens as
baths. It enjoys an extreme fertility and abundance of victuals;
indeed, the whole island in this regard is one of the most
remarkable in God's creation. We passed Thursday the 14th
anchored in a river below the town into which the tide from
the sea flowed and ebbed,168 and there we stayed the night
of Friday. The wind then changed to the west, and we had
no way to sail.
Between us and our destination, al-Madinah, the town known
to the Christians as Palermo, lay five and twenty miles, and
we feared that we would be held long at Termini. But we
thanked God Most High for His gracious favour in having
(already) brought us in two days across a passage that stayed
other ships, as we were told, twenty or thirty days and more;
and on the morning of Friday in the middle of the holy month,
we rose deterrnined to journey overland by foot. We discharged
our design, and, carrying some of our effects, and
having left some of our companions to guard the chattels
remaining in the ship, we set forth.
We travelled along a road like a market so populous it was,
with men coming and going. Groups of Christians that met us
themselves uttered the first greetings, and treated us with
courtesy. We observed in their attitude and insinuating address
towards the Muslims that which would offer temptation to
ignorant souls. May God, in His power and bounty, preserve
from seducement the people of Muhammad - God's blessings
upon him.
We came at last to Qasr Sa'd [Solanto Castle], which lies
a parasang from Palermo, and being seized with fatigue, turned
aside and passed the night in it. The castle is on the seashore,
and is lofty and ancient, for it was built in the time of the
Muslim occupation of the island. It always was, and still is,
by the grace of God, inhabited by pious (Muslims). Around
it are numerous tombs of ascetic and pious Muslims, and it is
known for its grace and blessedness, being visited by men from
all countries. Opposite it is a spring known as 'Ayn al-Majnunah
366 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
[the Spring of the Mad Woman]. The castle has a strong iron
door. Inside are the living quarters, and commanding belvederes,
and well-planned suites; the place indeed has all the
conveniences of living. At its summit, is one of the finest
mosques in the world. It is an oblong building with long
arcades spread with spotless mats of a workmanship such as
I have never seen better; and within it are hung forty lamps
of brass and crystal. In front of the mosque is the broad road
which girdles the upper part of the castle. In the lower part
is a well containing sweet water.
We passed the most pleasing and agreeable night in that
mosque, and listened to the call to prayer, which long we had
not heard. We were shown high regard by the residents of
the mosque, amongst whom was an imam who led them in
the obligatory prayers and, in this holy month, the tarawih
[special and additional prayers of twenty prostrations, performed
in the month of Ramadan].
Near this castle, about a mile away in the direction of
Palermo, is a similar castle known as Qasr Ja'far, which contains
a spring of sweet water.
We noticed on this road churches prepared for the Christian
sick.159 In their cities they have them after the model of the
Muslim hospitals, and we have seen their like at Acre and
Tyre. We marvelled at such solicitude.
After the morning prayers, we bent our way to al-Madinah.
On arrival we made to enter, but were stopped and directed
to a gate near the palace of the Frankish King - may God
relieve the Muslims of his dominance. We were then conducted
to his Commissioner that he might question us as to
our intentions, as they do in the case of all strangers. Over
esplanades, through doors, and across royal courts they led us,
gazing at the towering palaces, well-set piazzas and gardens,
and the ante-chambers given to the officials. All this amazed
our eyes and dazzled our minds, and we remembered the words
of Almighty and Glorious God: 'But that all mankind would
become one people (i.e. infidels), we would have given those
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 367
who denied merciful God silver roofs for their houses, and
stairways to mount to them' [Koran XLIII, 33, gold and silver
having no value in the sight of God].
Amongst the things we observed was a hall set in a large
court enclosed by a garden and flanked by colonnades. The
hall occupied the whole length of that court, and we marvelled
at its length and the height of its belvederes. We understood
that it was the dining-hall of the King and his companions,
and that the colonnades and the ante-chambers are where his
magistrates, his officials, and his stewards sit in presence.
The Commissioner came out to us, walking majestically
between the servants who surrounded him and carried the train
of his robes. We looked upon a stately old man with long
white moustaches, who questioned us in supple Arabic as to our
design and our country. We told him, and he showed pity
for us, and, with repeated salutations and invocations, ordered
that we be allowed to depart. He gave us much cause to
wonder. His first question to us had been for news of Constantinople
and what we knew of it, but alas we had nothing
we could tell him. We shall give news of it later.
One of the strangest examples of seducement into waywardness
that we witnessed happened as we left the castle, when
one of the Christians seated at the gate said to us: 'Look to
what you have with you, pilgrims, lest the officials of the
Customs descend on you.' He thought, of course, that we
carried merchandise liable to customs duty. But another
Christian replied to him saying, 'How strange you are. Can
they enter into the King's protection and yet fear? I should hope
for them (to receive) nothing but thousands of rubayyat. Go
in peace, you have nothing to fear.' Overwhelmed with surprise
at what we had seen and heard, we departed to an inn
where we took lodgings on Saturday the 16th of the holy
month and the 22nd of December. On leaving the castle, we
had gone through a long and covered portico down which
we walked a long way until we came to a great church. We
learnt that this portico was the King's way to the church.
368 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Recollections of al-Madinah [Palermo], the capital of
Sicily
May God restore it (to the Muslims)
It is the metropolis of these islands, combining the benefits
of wealth and splendour, and having all that you could wish
of beauty, real or apparent, and all the needs of subsistence,
mature and fresh. It is an ancient and elegant city, magnificent
and gracious, and seductive to look upon. Proudly set between
its open spaces and plains filled with gardens, with broad roads
and avenues, it dazzles the eyes with its perfection. It is a wonderful
place, built in the Cordova style, entirely from cut stone
known as kadhan [a soft limestone]. A river splits the town,
and four springs gush in its suburbs. The King, to whom it is
his world, has embellished it to perfection and taken it as the
capital of his Frankish Kingdom - may God destroy it.
The King's palaces are disposed around the higher parts, like
pearls encircling a woman's full throat. The King roams through
the gardens and courts for amusement and pleasure. How many
- may they not long be his - palaces, constructions, watchtowers,
and belvederes160 he has, how many fine monasteries
whose monks he has put in comfort by grants of large fiefs,
and how many churches with crosses of gold and silver! May
it be that God will soon repair the times for this island, making
it again a home of the faith, and by His power delivering it
from fear to security. For He can perform what He desires.
The Muslims of this city preserve the remaining evidence of
the faith.161 They keep in repair the greater number of their
mosques, and come to prayers at the call of the muezzin. In
their own suburbs they live apart from the Christians. The
markets are full of them, and they are the merchants of the
place.162 They do not congregate for the Friday service, since
the khutbah is forbidden. On feast-days (only may) they recite
it with intercessions for the 'Abbasid Caliphs.163 They have
a qadi to whom they refer their law-suits, and a cathedral
mosque where, in this holy month, they assemble under its
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 369
lamps. The ordinary mosques are countless, and most of them
are used as schools for Koran teachers. But in general these
Muslims do not mix with their brethren under infidel patronage,
and enjoy no security for their goods, their women, or
their children. May God, by His favour, amend their lot with
His beneficence.
One point of resemblance between this town and Cordova -
for one thing always resembles another in some direction - is
its having in the middle of the new city an old one known as
the Qasr al-Qadim [the old Castle], just as there is in Cordova
- God protect it. In this old castle are mansions like lofty castles
with towers hidden in the skies, bewildering the sight with
their splendour.
One of the most remarkable works of the infidels that we
saw was the church known as the Church of the Antiochian.164
We examined it on the Day of the Nativity [Christmas Day],
which with them is a great festival; and a multitude of men
and women had come to it. Of the buildings we saw, the spectacle
of one must fail of description, for it is beyond dispute
the most wonderful edifice in the world. The inner walls are
all embellished with gold. There are slabs of coloured marble,
the like of which we had never seen, inlaid throughout with
gold mosaic and surrounded by branches {formed from) green
mosaic. In its upper parts are well-placed windows of gilded
glass which steal all looks by the brilliance of their rays, and
bewitch the soul. God protect us (from their allurement). We
learnt that its founder, after whom it was named, spent hundredweights
of gold on it. He had been vizier to the grandfather
of this polytheist King. This church has a belfry supported by
columns of coloured marble. It was raised cupola over cupola,
each with its separate columns, and is therefore known as the
Columned Belfry, and is one of the most wonderful constructions
to be seen. May God, in His kindness and benevolence,
soon exalt it with the adhan ['call to prayers', i.e. make it a
Muslim mosque].
The Christian women of this city follow the fashion of
370 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Muslim women, are fluent of speech, wrap their cloaks about
them, and are veiled. They go forth on this Feast Day dressed
in robes of gold-embroidered silk, wrapped in elegant cloaks,
concealed by coloured veils, and shod with gilt slippers. Thus
they parade to their churches, or (rather) their dens [a play
on the words kanais, 'churches', and kunus, 'dens'], bearing all
the adornments of Muslim women, including jewellery, henna
on the fingers, and perfumes. We called to mind - in the way
of a literary witticism - the words of the poet: 'Going into the
church one day, he came upon antelope and gazelle.'
We invoke God's protection for this description which enters
the gates of absurdity and leads to the vanities of indulgence,
and seek protection also from the bewitchment that leads to
dotage. In truth He is the Lord of power and forgiveness.
Seven days we spent in this city, living in a hostel used by
Muslims. We left it on the morning of Friday the 22nd of
this holy month and the 28th of December, bound for Trapani,
where there are two ships, one waiting to sail to Andalusia
and the other to Ceuta. We had sailed to Alexandria in this,
and both were carrying pilgrims and Muslim merchants.
Through a line of continuous villages and farms we trended,
observing land, both tilled and sown, such as we had never
seen before for goodness, fertility, and amplitude. We compared
it to the 'qanbaniyah' [Latin, campania, 'countryside', a
relic of the Roman occupation] of Cordova, but this soil is
choicer and more fertile.
We passed one night only on the road at a place called
'Alqamah [Alcamo], a large and spacious town with markets
and mosques. Its inhabitants, and those of the farms we had
passed on our way, were Muslims all. Leaving 'Alqamah at
daybreak on Saturday the 23 rd of the holy month and the 29th
of December, we passed, not far from it, a castle called Hisn
al-Hammah [the Castle of the Baths]. It is a large place with
many thermal springs which God throws up from the ground
charged with special elements, and so hot that the body can
hardly bear them. We passed one on our road and, dismounting
THE MONTH OF RAMADAN THE VENERATED (580) 371
from our animals, refreshed our bodies by bathing in it.
We arrived at last at Trapani in the late afternoon of that day
and lodged in a house that we hired for the purpose.
Recollections of the town of Atrabanish [Trapani] in the
island of Sicily
May God restore it (to the Muslims)
Trapani is a small city enclosed by walls, and white as a dove.
It possesses an excellent harbour, most suited for shipping, and
is therefore much used by the Rum, particularly those who sail
to the Barr al-'Adwah [the coast of Africa].165 Between it and
Tunis is only a day and a night's journey, and the voyage
is never stayed, winter or summer, save when the wind is
unfavourable. Otherwise, the crossing by that course is very
short.
Trapani is furnished with markets and baths and all the commodities
needed in a town. But it lies in the throat of the sea,
which encompasses it on three sides. It is joined to the land
by only a narrow strip, and the yawning sea waits to engulf
the rest. Its people indeed say that the sea will assuredly swallow
it. May the end of its days be remitted. But the future is veiled
from all save God Most High.
The low prices, resulting from the wide cultivation, make
life easy and comfortable in this town, where the Muslims and
the Christians have each their mosques and their churches. Near
to its eastern corner and mclining to the north, is a great mountain
of immense height. At its summit is an isolated crag, on
which is a Rumi stronghold connected to the mountain by
a bridge. Near to it on the mountain the Rum have a large
town, the women of which are said to be the fairest of all the
island. God grant that they be made captives of the Muslims.
On the mountain are vineyards and cornfields, and we learnt
that it has some four hundred springs. It is called Jabal Hamid
[Mount St. Julian],166 and its ascent is quite easy on one side,
its people saying that through it Sicily may be conquered. God
372 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
grant that it be. But in no case will they allow a Muslim to
ascend, to it, and for this reason they have prepared this strong
fortress. Should they apprehend aught, they would collect their
women inside it and cut the bridge, leaving a great ditch
between them and those on the heights of the adjacent
mountain.
It is a strange fact that this town should have all these springs,
as described, while Trapani, lying in the plain, should have no
water save in a well at some distance from it, and in the not
deeply sunk wells of its houses where it is brackish and cannot
be swallowed.
At Trapani we found the two ships waiting to sail to the
west. We hope, if God wills, to embark on the one bound for
Spain. May God with His favour vouch unto us His accustomed
beneficent offices.
To the west of Trapani, and about two parasangs from it,
are three small close-lying islands called Malitimah [Maritimo],
Yabisah [Levanzo], and al-Rahib [Favignana], which was
named after a monk who lived on its summit in a fortresslike
building that serves as a place of ambush for the enemy.
The other two islands are uninhabited, and in this lives no one
but the monk we have mentioned.
The Month of Shawwal (580)
[5th of January-2nd of February, 1185]
May God grant us His grace and favour
THE new moon commenced on the night of Saturday the
5th of January, according to testimony given to the Hakim
of Trapani to the effect that the new moon of the month of
Ramadan had been seen on the night of Thursday and that
the people of the capital of Sicily, already described, had begun
the fast on that Thursday.167 The people therefore began their
festival of the ending (of the month of fasting) after taking
count from that Thursday. We prayed, on this holy feast-day,
in a mosque in Trapani with a group of its inhabitants who had
refrained, for a proper reason, from going to the musalla [place
of prayer, where the khutbah was recited. See note 1 6 3 ] . "We
offered up the traveller's prayer.108 May God restore every
stranger to his homeland. The remainder of the people, with
timbal and horn, went to the musalla with their magistrate.
We marvelled at this, and at the Christian's tolerance of it.
Having agreed on the price of our passage in the ship going,
within, the will of God, to Spain, we turned our minds to provisions
for the journey. But God alone can assure our help and
easement, for there arrived an order from the King of Sicily
stopping all ships from sailing from the shores of his island.
It seems that he is preparing a fleet, and no ships may sail until
the fleet has left. May God frustrate his designs, and may he
not achieve his ends. The Genoese owners of the two ships
hurried aboard to protect themselves from the Wali, but he
relaxed as the result of a bribe the Genoese gave him, so that
they remained in their ship and awaited a wind on which to
sail.
At this time there came from the west the sad news that the
Lord of Majorca had seized Bajayah [Bougie].169 May God
y
374 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
grant that it be not so, and give, in His grace and favour,
success and quiet to the Muslims.
The people of Trapani are making conjectures as to the
destination of the fleet this tyrant is preparing. As to its numbers,
some say there are three hundred sail, between galleys
and dromonds, while others say there are more, and that a
hundred ships carrying victuals are to accompany it. May God
frustrate it, and turn fortune against it. Some men say its
destination is Alexandria - may God guard and defend it - and
others Majorca - God defend it170 - while yet others say Africa
- God defend it - in defiance of the Treaty, being urged thereto
by the bad news from the west; but this conjecture is the most
unlikely, for the King appears to respect the Treaty.171 May
God lend His aid against him, and not for him.
There are others who see the levy as intended solely for
Constantinople the Great, because of the momentous news
which has come concerning it; news which inspires the soul
with bodings of strange events, proving incontestably the
truth of the traditions transmitted from the Chosen One
[Muhammad]172 - God's blessings upon him. The report had
it that the sovereign of Constantinople [Manuel Comnenos]
had died and left the kingdom to his wife, who had a young
son. But his cousin had usurped the throne, killed the widow,
and seized the boy. A son of the rebel had been enjoined to
kill the boy, but, his heart being moved to compassion, he had
released the youth, who after many hazards, had been brought
by destiny to this island.173 He arrived in wretched state as a
menial, being servant to a monk, and concealing his royal figure
in a lackey's cloak. But the secret came out and the affair was
disclosed, for the cloak was of no avail. When by order of
William King of Sicily the youth was brought before him and
questioned, he declared that he was the serf and servant of the
monk. But a party of Genoese on their way to Constantinople
confirmed his identity and proved that it was he. There were
besides, the signs and indications of royalty that shone from
him, amongst which, as it was related to us, was the following:
THE MONTH OF SHAWWAL (580) 375
It happening that King William went forth on one of his
feast-days, the people had disposed themselves to greet him,
and the youth in question was placed amongst the personal
suite. All bowed deeply in humility and deference to the King
that his looks might fall upon them: all save the youth, who
did not incline deeply in salutation. Then was it known that
his royal dignity had held him from giving the reverence of
a subject. King William took great care of him, bestowing on
him a dwelling-place and keeping him under most careful protection
for fear that his cousin the rebel might do him mischief
unawares.
He had a sister famed for her beauty with whom the usurping
cousin had become enamoured. Yet he could not marry
her, for the Rum do not take their kinswomen in marriage.
But impetuous love, blind and deafening desire, and the transports
that lead their possessor to bliss and then desert him,
impelled him to take her and go with her to the Emir Mas'ud,
Prince of Darub [Cilician Gates] and of Quniyah [Iconium, or
modern Konia] and the lands of the foreigners adjoining Constantinople.
Of the zeal of this Emir for Islam we have already
spoken in these writings. It is enough to tell you that the Prince
of Constantinople still pays tribute to him, and propitiates him
by ceding some neighbouring territories.
In the presence of the Emir, he embraced, together with his
(beloved) cousin, the creed of Islam; and a golden crucifix
which had been heated by fire, he trampled beneath his feet.
This, according to their fashion, is the surest way of renouncing
the Christian religion and giving allegiance to the faith of Islam.
He then married his cousin and achieved the object of his desire.
Finally, he took the Muslim armies to Constantinople and
entered it with them, slaying of its inhabitants some fifty thousand
of the Rum. He was aided in his enterprise by the
Aghr n, who are a sect of the people of the Book. They
speak Arabic, and for all other sects of their race they bear a
concealed enmity. They do not allow the eating of pork. The
citizens weakened themselves by their dissensions, and God
376 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
struck the spring of strife between them so that the Muslims
seized Constantinople.174
Its countless riches were taken to the Emir Mas'ud, who
placed over forty thousand Muslim horsemen in the city, which
now adjoined the Muslim lands. This conquest if it be true, is
one of the greatest portents of the Day of Judgement. God
best knows of hidden things.
We found this story to be spread about the island on the
tongues of the Muslims and Christians alike, who believe it,
and have no doubts about it. News of it had been brought by
some Rum ships which had arrived from Constantinople, and
the first question of the King's Commissioner when we were
brought before him on our entry into Palermo had been
whether we had news of Constantinople. "We knew nothing,
and did not understand the meaning of the question until later.
They then enquired concerning the question of the King of
Constantinople, this youth, and the rebel's pursuit of him, for
he has spies who seek to kill him; indeed, because of this the
youth is kept near to the Prince of Sicily, so closely guarded
that an eye-glance can hardly fall on him. We were told that
he is a tender shoot of youth with the rosy hue of a stripling,
slender and with a royal splendour about him. He studies with
diligence the Arabic and other tongues, is distinguished for his
kingly bearing, and is sagacious, despite his youthful age and
inexperience.
Now, as it is reported, the Sicilian King intends to despatch
the fleet to Constantinople,175 in shame for this youth and what
befell him. But however these designs may fare, Almighty and
Glorious God will drive him back with losses, showing him
the unblessed nature of his way, and raising tempests to confound
him. For as He desires so can He accomplish. This news
from Constantinople - God grant that it be true - is one of the
greatest miracles and awaited manifestations of the world. God
indeed is all-powerful in His decrees and in what He predetermines.
The Month of Dhu 'l-Qa'dah (A.H. 580)
[3rd of February-4th of March, 1185]
May God accord us His grace and favour
THE new moon rose on the night of Monday the 4th of
February, while we awaited in Trapani the end of winter
and the sailing of the Genoese ship in which we hoped to travel
to Andalusia. Pray God - Mighty and Glorious is He, and to
be praised-may bless our aim, and help us with His grace
and favour in our designs.
During the time of our stay in this town, we learnt painful
things about the grievous state of the Muslims in this island
concerning their relations with the worshippers of the Cross -
may God destroy them - their humiliation and abasement, their
state of vassalage under the Christians, and the duress of the
king, bringing the calamities and misfortunes of apostasy on
those of their women and children for whom God had ordained
such suffering.
The King sometimes used force as a means of making some
of their sheiks renounce their faith. There is the story of recent
years concerning one of the learned doctors in Muslim law in
the capital of their tyrant king. He is known as Ibn Zur'ah,
and was so pressed by the demands of the officials that he
declared his renunciation of Islam and plunged into the Christian
religion. He diligently memorised the New Testament, studied
the usages of the Rum, and learnt their canon law, until he
was accepted into the body of priests who give judgement on
law-suits between Christians. When a Muslim case arose, he
would give judgement on that too, based on his previous
knowledge of the Muslim religious law; and thus recourse was
made to his decisions under both codes. He owned a mosque
opposite his house which he converted into a church. God protect
us from the results of apostasy and false ways. With all
378 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
this, we heard that he but concealed what was really his true
faith; and it may be that he took advantage of the exception
allowed for in God's words, 'Save he who, being under compulsion,
yet in his heart believes' [Koran XVI, 106].
During the last few days there has come to this town the
leader and Lord of the Muslim community in this island, the
Qa'id Abu '1-Qasim ibn Hammud,176 commonly known as
Ibn al-Hajar. This man belongs to that noble house on the
island of which the eldest son successively assumes the Lordship
(of the Muslims). We were further told that he is an
upright man, liking good, loving his kind, full of acts of charity
such as ransoming prisoners, and distributing alms to travellers
and stranded pilgrims, together with many noble deeds and
generous acts.
The town became greatly disturbed on his arrival. He had
recently been out of favour with this tyrant, who had confined
him to his house, on charges preferred against him by his
enemies, who traduced him with untrue stories, including that
of corresponding with the Almohades - whom God support.
He would have been destroyed, but for the Guardian Angel,
and even then suffered a series of divestments which exacted
from him more than thirty thousand mu'mini dinars. He was
parted from all the houses and properties which he had inherited
from his forebears, and at last was without wealth. More recently
the tyrant had taken him back in his favour, and had granted
him. a post in his government. But he discharged his duties like
a slave, his person and his property impounded.
When he arrived at Trapani, he expressed a wish to meet us.
We met and he revealed to us such matters concerning his and
his people's relations with their enemies as to draw tears of
blood from the eyes and melt the heart in suffering. For instance,
he said to me, 'I have wished to be sold (as a slave), I and my
family, that perhaps the sale would free us from the state we
are in and lead to our dwelling in Muslim lands.' Reflect on
a state of affairs which could lead this man, notwithstanding
his great authority and exalted rank, his large household, his
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-QA'DAH (580) 379
sons and his (laughters, to make such a choice. For him and for
all the Muslims of this island, we begged of Almighty and
Glorious God a happy deliverance; and upon every Muslim
standing in worship before Great and Glorious God lies the
duty of offering prayers on their behalf. In tears ourselves, we
left him crying. But our spirits had been enriched by the nobleness
of his actions, his rare qualities, the soundness of his judgement,
his limitless beneficence and generosity, and the goodness
of his character and nature.
When in Palermo we had seen houses belonging to him,
his brothers, and members of his house, which were like lofty
and superb castles. The condition of these men, in a word, was
exalted, and his was so in particular. During his time here he
has performed many good deeds towards those pilgrims who
are poor or distressed, mending their affairs, and giving them
the money for the cost of their journey, as well as provisions.
May God prosper him for it, and give him by His grace, his
just reward.
The (Muslim) people of this island suffer, amongst other
tribulations, one that is very sore. Should a man show anger
to his son or his wife, or a woman to her daughter, the one
who is the object of displeasure may perversely throw himself
into a church, and there be baptised and turn Christian. Then
there will be for the father no way of approaching his son, or
the mother her daughter. Conceive now the state of one so
afflicted in his family or even in his son. The dread of thenfalling
to this temptation would alone shorten his life. The
Muslims of Sicily therefore are most watchful of the management
of their family, and their children, in case this should
happen. The most clear-sighted of them fear that it shall chance
to them all as it did in earlier times to the Muslim inhabitants
of Crete. There a Christian despotism so long visited them
with one (painful) circumstance after the other that they were
all constrained to turn Christian, only those escaping whom God
so decreed. But the word of chastisement shall fall upon these
infidels. God's will shall prevail: there is indeed no God but He.
380 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
So great is the standing of this al-Hamudi [Abu Kassim]
amongst the Christians - may God destroy them-that they
declare that if he turned Christian, not a Muslim in the island
but would follow him and imitate his act. May God protect
them all, and deliver them, in His grace and favour, from
their plight.
We came upon another striking example of their state, such
as breaks the spirit in pity and melts the heart in compassion.
One of the notables of this town of Trapani sent his son to
one of our pilgrim companions, desiring of him that he would
accept from him a daughter, a young virgin who was nearing
the age of puberty. Should he be pleased with her, he could
marry her; if not, he could marry her to any one of his countrymen
who liked her. She would go with them, content to leave
her father and her brothers, desiring only to escape from the
temptation (of apostasy), and to live in the lands of the Muslims.
Her father and brothers were disposed to this proposal,
since they themselves might find escape to Muslim lands when
the embargo that impeded them should be suspended. The man
sought after, in order to earn a heavenly reward, accepted the
offer, and we helped him to seize an opportunity which would
lead him to the felicities both of this world and the next.
We ourselves were filled with wonder at a situation which
would lead a man to give up so readily this trust tied to his
heart, and to surrender her to one strange to her, to bear in
patience the want of her, and to suffer longings for her and
loneliness without her. We were likewise amazed at the girl -
may God protect her - and at her willingness to leave her kin
for her love of Islam, and her wish 'to seize a solid handle'
[Koran II, 256; XXXI, 22]. May Almighty and Glorious God
protect and guard her and console her by uniting her to her
own and, by His grace, confer on her His favours. When her
father had consulted her as to the project she had said, 'If you
hold me back, the responsibility (before God) will be yours.'
The girl was motherless, but had two brothers and a little
sister from the same father.
The Month of Dhu 'l-Hijjah (A.H. 380)
[5 th of March-3rd of April, 1185]
May God accord us His favour and blessings
THE new moon was concealed from us by the continuing
storm, so we completed the days of the month of Dhu
l-Qa'dah, by computation, on the night of Wednesday the
6th of March. We were still in this city [Trapani], eagerly
awaiting an early departure, and the good news of a favouring
wind.. May God in His power promote our purposes and
ensure our safety. It happened that we saw the new moon on
the night of Wednesday. It had waxed, so it was known that
it had risen on the night of Tuesday, and the computation of
the month was changed thereto. At midday of Wednesday the
9th of the month, the 13th of March - which was the Day of
'Arafah, may God give us of His blessings, and the blessings
of the holy station on 'Arafat - we embarked on the ship.
May God prosper it, and grant us safety in it.
We passed the night ready for travelling - God grant that
our journey be expeditious - and on the morning of the Feast
of Sacrifice we were on the deck of the ship. May God help
us to endure tribulation in it. We are more than fifty Muslims.
May God protect all, and in His grace and favour, unite them
to their native lands. Praise be to Him who can ensure this.
We were eager to sail, but the wind was not propitious, and
for twelve days we came and went between the ship and the
shore, being each night disposed to sail. At last God allowed
us to put to sea on the morning of Tuesday the 21st of Dhu
'1-Hijyah, the 25th of March.
We sailed, by the blessings of God Most High, in three Rumi
ships which had agreed to keep course together, the foremost
keeping contact with the last. We came to the island of al-
Rahib [Favignana], which we have already mentioned in this
382 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
narrative, and which lies about eighteen miles fromTrapani. The
wind having changed, we turned aside to its port. There by
a singular coincidence we found the ship of Marco the Genoese,
which had come from Alexandria with more than two hundred
of our companions, the Maghrabi pilgrims. We had parted with
them at Mecca - may God sanctify it - in the month of Dhu
'1-Hijjah of the year 9 [A.H. 579], and had heard no news of
them since leaving them, nor had they of us. Amongst them
was a party of our company from Granada, including the jurisprudent
Abu Ja'far ibn Sa'id, our companion and guest in
Mecca at the time of our sojourn there. When they learnt of
us, they gazed upon us from the ship, clinging to its sides and
edges, raising their voices to announce the good news of our
safety and our meeting, joyful at our reunion, weeping for
happiness, lost in amazement, and marvelling at the good cheer
which had befallen them. We felt the same for them, and the
day was indeed felicitous, and following the great Feast, we
took it as a new feast. Friends visited each other, and we and
they passed the happiest and pleasantest of nights. This meeting
we took to be a happy augury of our hopes of reunion,
if Almighty and Powerful God pleases, with our native lands.
At dawn of the night of Tuesday the 22nd of the month,
God gave us a favouring wind, and we sailed in four ships,
heading, under the providence of God Most High, for the
island of Andalusia [Spain]. All that day we sailed along, our
ships urged by an easy wind, but our longings for Andalusia
almost took the place of the wind, for their excitement and
commotion. May God help and speed us. But after a day and
two nights under way, the wind changed and blew from the
west into our faces, turning us back along our tracks so that
we returned to our start at the port of the island of Favignana.
We arrived there on the night of Thursday, the 24th of the
month. We sailed from it on the evening of Friday following,
alone and without the other ships, and were alarmed by a
vehement wind which drove the ship on at speed, so that by
the morning of Sunday the 27th of the month we had come
THE MONTH OF DHU 'L-HIJJAH (580) 383
to the tip of the island of Sardinia, which, we speedily passed.
Its length is more than two hundred miles. Joyfully we
announced the good news to each other, and in a day and two
nights our ship was able to cross more than five hundred miles,
a remarkable thing. The favouring wind then stilled, and
another blew and took us, on the night of Monday the 28th
of the month, the 1st of April, towards the coast of Africa.
On Monday we anchored at an island known as Khalitah
[Galita]. It is uninhabited, but it is said that it was inhabited
of old, and is now the mark of the enemy. About thirty miles
he between it and the mainland, which is visible to the eye.
In the entrance to the port we endured rough seas, from which
God protected us, and, since the storm continued, we remained
in it awaiting relief from God Most High. Four days we stayed
there, the last being Thursday, the beginning of Muharram.
The Month of Muharram of the Year 81 (381)
[4th of April-3rd of May, 1185]
God grant us His grace and favour
THE new moon was obscured from us, and we computed
it as beginning on the night of Thursday the 4th of April.
May God grant us the blessings of this year, and its favours,
giving us of its benefits and preserving us from its evils, and
vouchsafing our reunion with our native land. He is indeed
the Listener and the Answerer. On the night of Friday following,
God sent us an east wind and on it we put to sea. It was
a soft and gentle wind, but it then became turbulent, and a
strong wind drove along the ship at the greatest speed and
smoothness. From the time of our embarking (at Trapani) we
had been unceasingly snuffing at the east in our anxiety for
a wind, but there came not a breeze, so that from its absence
we deemed it to be a thing of fable, till God overtook us with
His benevolence and benign works and sent it to us now in
the month of April. May God in His grace and favour grant
us safety. This wind accompanied us for about two days, during
which we progressed with celerity. "We passed the island of
Sardinia on our right. Varying winds then played with us, and
there we stayed, going the length and breadth of the sea and
perceiving no land until our thoughts were agitated and we
conceived that the winds would bring us to the coast of Barshlunah
[Barcelona]. May God destroy it. But God brought us
relief, and we descried the coast of the island of Yabisah [Iviza]
on the night of Saturday the 10th of the month, although we
could hardly see it from the cloud-enveloped distance. But on
Saturday it appeared clearly to us, and after undergoing difficulties
from the varying winds at its ingress, we entered the
port and anchored. The city was four miles away. Our place of
anchorage was opposite the island of Faramantirah [Formentera],
THE MONTH OF MUHARRAM (581) 385
which is separated four or five miles from Iviza and has
many inhabited villages. "We stayed in its port near two rugged
mountains which confront each other and which are called
al-Sheikh and al-'Ajuz ['The Old Man' and 'The Old Woman'].
That night, at eventide, we descried the mountains of Andalusia,
the nearest being the mountain of Daniyah [Denia] known
as Qa'un [Mongo]. We gazed upon this land, joyful to see it,
and rejoicing in approaching it. On the morning of Sunday,
the n t h of the month, we came to the port of Denia, but the
wind being from the west, we awaited Almighty and Glorious
God's fulfilment of His beneficent works, if He so willed, by
sending a favourable wind by which to spread our sails under
His mercy. And on the morning of Tuesday the 13 th, with
the favour and blessings (of God) we sailed with a light east
wind we hardly felt, begging Almighty and Glorious God to
animate its life and strengthen its force. The mountains of Denia
were now visible before us. May God complete His favour to
us, and in His power perfect His work on our behalf. By His
goodness, the wind continued and spread so that we came to
Qartagannah [Cartagena] (and landed) on the evening of
Thursday the 15th, thanking God for the safety and health He
had granted. Praise be to Him, Lord of the Universe, His
blessings upon Muhammad, Seal of the Prophets, and Leader
of the Messengers (of God).
We left after the Friday prayers on the 16th of the month,
and passed the night in the territory of Cartagena, in the tower
known as the Tower of the Three Cisterns; from it on Saturday
we fared to Murcia, thence the same day to Libralah
[Lebrilla], thence on Sunday to Lurqah [Lorca], on Monday
to al-Mansurah, on Tuesday to the plain of Qanalish [Caniles
di Baza], on Wednesday to Wadi Ash [Guadix]. On Thursday
the 22nd of Muharram [581], the 25th of April [1185], we
came to our home in Granada.
'She threw away her staff and there she stayed,
As does the traveller at his journey's end.'
386 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR.
Praise be to God for His beneficent works, and for the easement
and relief He gave us. His blessings upon the Lord of
the Messengers and of others, Muhammad, his noble Messenger
and Chosen One, and upon his family, and his Companions
who followed the true course by his guidance. May he be
preserved, exalted, and honoured.
The span of our journey, from the time of our leaving
Granada, to that of our return, was two full years and three
months and a half.
Praise be to God, Lord of the Universe.
Notes
i. A.H. = Anno Hijrah, or the 'Year of the Migration' of the prophet
Muhammad to Medina from Mecca in A.D. 622, from which date the Muhammadan
era begins. In their calendar the months are computed by the time
elapsing between consecutive new moons, and the resulting lunar years of 354
days co not coincide with our solar years with their fixed almanac months.
The lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar, and so each cycle of a
hundred Muhammadan years gains three years on a western cycle. The formula
" 3 A.H.
A.H. L62I=A.D.
IOO
gives a. rough correspondence. The lunar months occupy a different place in the
calendar each year, so that, for example, the sacred months in which the pilgrimage
must be performed will some years fall in the winter and in others in the
summer, spring or autumn. The date of the lunar month, like that of the Jewish,
gives the age of the moon.
2. The legal Muslim day begins at sunset. When therefore Ibn Jubayr says that
he left at 'the first hour of Thursday the 3rd of February' he left after sunset on
Thursday, which was the first hour of the 8th of Shawwal, which extended to
sunset of Friday the 4th of February. This adjustment must be made throughout
the book in such cases. By the same token, 'the night of Thursday' must be
rendered 'Wednesday night' in our style.
3. The text says 'al-Ghaydaq'. I have accepted Schiaparelli's emendation.
4.1 have accepted Schiaparelli's substitution of 'Qashmah' for 'Nashmah'. There
is a burgh named Casma that was part of the lands of Medina Sidonia and that
is near to the sea and on Ibn Jubayr's road to Tarifa. Moreover, the Arabic 'N'
is very easily confounded with the 'Q'.
5. Rum is the term the Arabs use to describe the Christians of the Orient, in
distinction to those of the West, whom they called Franks. The Genoese and
other Italians, although sometimes included amongst the Franks, were more
generally confounded with the Greeks as 'Rum'.
6. An Arabic mile measured 1,921 metres as compared with 1,609 in an
English mile.
7. Qusmarkah. Schiaparelli refers to Carta Catalana, 1375 (see Nordenskiold,
Periplus), which says 'Cauo sa March', and to Benincasa, 1476 (see Lelewel,
Portulan gbiiral), 'Caou sa March', both of which are close to the Arabic transcription.
388 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
8. Although the Barr all-Gharb (Land of the West) of the North African coast
usually refers to the western sector extending from the Gulf of Qabes westward,
in this case the author comprehends as well the shores of Egypt.
9. Wright edited diis 'The Islands of the Bath', but I am with Schiaparelli, who
quotes Idrissi, I, c, p. 101, and Bakri, Description de VAfrique septentrionale, ed.
de Slane, p. 85. The Carta Catalana has 'Ilia de colomi'.
10. Ai.funduk, probably derived from the Greek TTCCV8OK£10V. Up to modern
times, according to Amari, Voyage en Sicile de Muhammad ebn Djubair, the Sicilian
dialect employs the word 'funducu' to describe the simpler inn on main roads or
in villages. Many of these inns are found in the Attarin (Ar., perfume) quarters.
11. Zakat in its primitive sense denotes 'purification', whence it is used to
describe that portion of property bestowed in alms as a sanctification of the
remainder to its owner. It is a religious duty incumbent on every Muslim who
is free, adult, and possessed of property upon which zakat is due. This must have
been in his possession for a whole year. Zakat is not due on the necessaries of life
like houses, or implements of work, such as books or tools. The zakat varies
according to the type of property. Camels, cattle, horses, sheep and goats, silver,
gold, mines, and the fruits of the earth have each their particular assessment.
Articles of merchandise are appraised and, if the value exceed two hundred
dirhams, a zakat of 2 J per cent, is paid on it. When collected, zakat may be
given to paupers, the needy, debtors, slaves for the purchase of their freedom,
travellers, the collectors of zakat, or be disbursed in the service of God or for
religious warfare.
12. These mudaris or colleges were theological seminaries founded in Cairo
by Saladin to promote the orthodox Shafi doctrine of the Sunni persuasion against
the Shi'ite heresy and the speculative philosophy of the Dar al-'Ilm (House of
Learning) established by the Fatimids. The students boarded in these collegiatemosques,
whose administration seems in part to have been copied by the early
universities of Europe (see Reuben Levi, A Baghdad Chronicle, Cambridge, 1929,
p. 193). For descriptions of these celebrated academies, which were almost as
famous for their architectural beauties as for their educational merits, cf. Hitti,
History of the Arabs, pp. 410-12 and 659-61, and Stanley Lane-Poole, A History
of Egypt in the Middle Ages, p. 204.
13. Ibn al-Sabil (son of the road) is the legal term for the traveller to whom,
at need, help may be given from the Bayt al-Mal (Treasury) from funds provided
by the zakat.
14. These mu'mini dinars were struck by the first Almohade Caliph, 'Abd
al-Mu'min (1130-63). As Ibn Jubayr says, they were worth half the Egyptian
dinar. Amari, ibid., note 78, says that he examined some of these coins in the
French Cabinet des Medailles together with the French numismatist M. A. de
JNUrJib 389
Longperrier, and found that their weight was 4.75 grammes, and that the gold
was very pure. The Tyrian dinar was not quite equivalent to the Egyptian.
Dinars and dirhams were respectively the standard gold and silver coins that
were instituted by the 'Umayyad Caliph 'Abd al-Malik about the year A.D. 691.
The names derived from the Roman denarius and the Greek drachma. In transition
to the Arabic, the silver denarius of the Romans became the gold coin of
the Arabs. It weighed almost sixty grains Troy and was worth intrinsically something
under ten shillings. It is to-day the name of the equivalent of the pound
sterling in Jordan and Iraq. The drachma or dirham remained the name of the
silver coin, weighed about 47^- grains Troy, was rated at about fifteen dirhams
to the gold dinar and, at the ratio of gold and silver of those days, was worth
about eightpence. It should not be forgotten, however, that gold and silver had
a considerably higher purchasing power before the discovery of the New World
in the fifteenth century, and an ounce of gold could command an amount of
food and labour that at the beginning of the twentieth century would have been
paid by three ounces. The dirham was also the unit of the system of weight.
15. The Festival of die Sacrifice has various names: 'Id al-Adha, 'Id al-Baqr,
'Id al-Kabir in Arab lands, while in Persia it is called 'Id Qurban, and in Turkey
and Egypt 'Id Bayram. It commemorates Abraham's preparedness to sacrifice
his son Ishmael, and is part of the ceremonies connected with the Hajj or pilgrimage.
It falls on the 10th day of the Muslim month of Dhu '1-Hijjah, the twelfth
month of dieir calendar, and the month in which the pilgrimage to Mecca must
be made. Ibn Jubayr will perform bis pilgrim rites a year later.
16. Misr is the name applied to Fustat, now old Cairo. Al-Qahira, 'the Victorious',
or modern Cairo, was founded in A.D. 969 by the Fatimid Dynasty.
17. The editor of the text quotes Maqrizi, vol. II, p. 436, as saying that it was
the head of Zayd ibn Ah '1-Husayn.
18. The Tabi'un, or followers of the Companions of the Prophet, are important
in die Sunni law for the traditions of the prophet which they related.
19. Abraham is extolled as the 'Friend of God' both in the Koran (IV, 125),
and in the Bible (Isa. xli. 8 and 2 Chron. xx. 7).
20. 'Sharifah' (pi. Sharifat) is the feminine of 'Sharif', a tide bestowed on tie
descendants of Muhammad through al-Hasan, the eldest son of his daughter
Fatimah. His Majesty the late King Abdulla of Jordan was the head of the line.
21. A congregational mosque (jami') is the large mosque in the city, where
Muslims gather for the midday prayers and the allocution called the khutbah.
The smaller mosque is called masjid.
22. The prophet's fifteen to twenty wives are called 'Mothers of the Muslims'
because by Koranic injunction (XXXIII, 53) their widowhood became perpetual,
and no Arab could marry a woman he had called 'Mother'.
z
390 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
23. The 'Abbaside Caliphs and their dependents wore black clothing in mourning
for the many persons of the Prophet's family who were martyred by the
previous dynasty of 'Umayyid Caliphs.
24. The tayhsan is a scarf thrown over the turban, with one end drawn under
the chin and dropped over the left shoulder.
25. It is the prerogative of the Caliph to be prayed for in these Friday khutbahs.
When Saladin removed the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, he replaced the name of die
Fatimid in die prayers widi that of die 'Abbaside Caliph of Baghdad, whose name
is here given in full. Saladin's own name then follows as the reigning sovereign.
26. The Almohades (Muwahhadis, 'Unitarians') arose from a revolt, led by a
Berber, against the anthropomorphic tendencies then prevalent in Islam. Believing
themselves to be the only true believers, they carried fire and sword from
Morocco northward through Spain, and westward to die frontiers of Egypt, to
form a vast new empire. The grandson of the first caliph of die dynasty, 'Abd
al-Mu'min, was Ya'qub I or al-Mansur (The Victorious), who gained this sobriquet
by his defeat of Alphonso VIII of Castile, and who was ruling at the time
of these travels. The expectations here reported of the enlargement of his empire
to include Egypt and die Hejaz were never fulfilled, for his successor was utterly
defeated by die allied Christian princes of Spain, and die dynasty was soon
extinguished.
27. This Nilometer was constructed in A.D. 716 by order of the 'Umayyad
Caliph Sulayman. The octagonal column stands in a square well sixteen feet in
diameter. The waters of the Nile at their lowest cover seven cubits of die column,
and when they cover sixteen, die Wafaa 'l-Nil (Full Nile Water) is announced
by die Nile-crier, whereupon die embankments of die irrigation canals are cut
(about the 24di of August), and die occasion is made one of popular merrymaking.
The rate of taxation was determined by die height of inundation from
ancient times, as testified by Strabo when describing the Nilometer at Assuan.
28. In Koran IV, 164, it has 'and God spake direcdy unto- Moses', whence he
is called Kalim Ilah, or 'God's Interlocutor'.
29. The Arabs probably obtained die word band, 'a post-stage', by corrupting
the Latin word veredus, 'a post-horse*. The Muslim Empire had a network of
post-roads, with post-houses where horses were kept at government expense.
The lengdi of die stage varied according to die nature of die country covered,
but in Syria it was generally six miles (see Mukaddasi, 181-2).
30. Schiaparelli, p. 354, note 22, says that among the many works that bear
the tide Al-Masalik wa'l Mamalik or Routes and Countries, which Ibn Jubayr cites,
there has been preserved that of Abu 'Ubayd al-Bakri, whose text relative to
Egypt is unedited. Cf. Quatremere in Notices et Extraites, ecc XII, pp. 437 seq.
Regarding the Wall of die Old Women, see Al-Khitat of al-Maqrizi, vol. I,
pp. 38 seq. and 199 seq. Another work of this tide, and perhaps die earliest of
JNUlilD 391
Arabic geographical treatises, is that of Ibn Khurdadbih, a Persian of the ninth
century of our era who, as Chief of the Post in the province of Jibal, the Medea
of the ancients, compiled this official handbook.
31. The redoubtable Reginald de Chatillon equipped five galleys and a large
number of smaller vessels and ravaged the Muslim territories on the Red Sea.
His armament was totally destroyed in the early months of 1183 by a fleet prepared
by Saladin and commanded by the chamberlain Husam al-Din Lu'lu. See
Ibn Athir, Tarikh al-Kamil, ed. Tornberg, vol. XI, p. 323; Abu Shamah, Kitab
al-Raudatain, Cairo, 1287-8, vol. II, p. 35 (in Historiens des Croisades, Auteurs
Arabes, vol. IV, p. 230), and Al-Maqrizi, Kitab al-Suluk (in Burckhardt, Travels
in Nubia, London, 1822, p. 497). It was from his castle of Kerak that Reginald
later made his swoop on the Muslim caravan that included the sister of Saladin
and so, violating the truce, precipitated the fall of Jerusalem.
32. 'Sea of Na'm' seems to be corrupt, and the editor of the text suggests
'Sea of Yemen'.
33. Schiaparelli points out (p. 354, note 24) that the dimensions of the temple
(birba) at Ikhmim given by al-Maqrizi, Khitat, vol. I, pp. 239-40, are the same as
those of Ibn Jubayr except for the length, which he gives as a hundred and seventy
spans. Idrissi in Description de I'Afrique et de I'Espagne, pp. 46-7, talks of the birba,
but places it in the centre of the city, while Ibn Jubayr has it 'east of the city
and below the walls'. This is the one, it would seem, mentioned by Herodotus,
vol. II, p. 91, as being surrounded by palm-trees. It was dedicated to Perseus,
whom the inhabitants claimed as being of their city by descent. They told
Herodotus that the gymnastic games they regularly held were celebrated on
instructions received from him when he visited them at die time of his bringing
away the Gorgon's head from Libya. Idrissi, it seems, speaks of the one founded
by Trajan (A.D. 53-117), which is the one mentioned by Abu '1-Fida that Reinaud,
Geographic d'Aboulfeda, vol. II, p. 152 (1848), declared to have been in ruins for
some years. Al-Maqrizi says that the temple of Ikhmim was destroyed in the
year A.H. 780 (A.D. 1378-9), and Ibn Battuta, vol. I, p. i n , says in A.D. 1326
that the destruction had begun then.
34. Quss ibn Sa'idah al-Iyadi, Bishop of Najran, to whose persuasive eloquence
the youthful Muhammad had listened as spellbound, and Sahban Wa'il were
two great preachers, one Christian, the other Muslim, whose eloquence in the
early days of Islam has passed into proverb.
35. 'Aydhab was the port on the Red Sea where the pilgrims, after the desert
journey from Qus or from Aswan on the Nile, took ship to Jiddah, the port of
Mecca. It was then an important terminal port for the Yemen, Abyssinian, and
Indian trade, but it was destroyed in 1422 by the Sultan of Egypt, and Suakin
took its place. Its site has been identified at 22'2o" N., 36'32" E., twelve miles
north of Halayb.
392 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
36. For the lacuna in the text the editor has supplied Qina, and Schiaparelli
Uswan (Aswan), which latter I prefer. By that route the pilgrim would continue
up the Nile from Qus until Aswan, where he would leave the river and
turn east across the desert to 'Aydhab. Al-Maqrizi, Khitat, vol. I, p. 197, mentions
this route, as does Aub '1-Fida, Geographie, vol. II, p. 144: 'Ibn Sayd fait remarquer
qu'a Asouan, dans la direction de l'orient, commence la route des pelerins qui
vont s'embarquer a Aydab et dans les autres ports de la mer Rouge pour se rendre
a la Mekke. En partant d'Asouan les pelerins suivent la route Alouadhah; cette
route se joint avec celle qui part de la ville de Cous [Qus]. Elle porte le nom
d'Ouadhah (Ouverte), parce qui a la difference de celle de Cous elle suit un
sol uni.'
37. Qara, lit. 'upper part of the road', and so, I presume, the side of the road, the
main path being beaten hollow by the coundess treadings of the passing camels.
38. Writing in A.D. 943, Mas'udi, vol. II, p. 438, declares that the round citron
(al-utruj al-mudawwar) and the orange-tree (shajar al-naranj) had been brought
from India since A.H. 300 (A.D. 912) and were first planted in Oman, whence
they were carried by caravan from al-Basrah into 'Iraq and Syria. He observes
that the trees were becoming numerous in Syria and Palestine, but that the fruit
had lost its original flavour, perfume, and colour because of the change from the
peculiar soil, climate, and water of its native land.
39. Hisbah is the punishment applied by the Muhtasib, an official who, by
Koranic precept, 'arranges' the affairs of the good and restrains the wrongdoer'.
It consists of flagellation with a dirrah (scourge), although in this case our author
would like the sword to be used.
40. Daqal, according to Mas'udi, vol. IV, p. 27, is the 'Iraqi name for the mast
of a ship (see Glossary, Wright, p. 31).
41. The date was in fact the 1st of Rabi' al-Akhir, the 24th of July, and, as
Schiaparelli indicates, Ibn Jubayr seems to have followed the appearance of the
moon rather than the calendar.
42. Although the text says 'the above-mentioned Emir of Mecca', that prince
has not hitherto been mentioned, so we may assume some earlier lacuna in
the MS.
43. The Great Divide of Islam is between Sunni and Shi'ah. The Sunnis, who
represent by far the greater part of Islam, acknowledge the first four caliphs who
succeeded Muhammad, and belong to one of the four orthodox schools of jurisprudence:
Hanbali, Hanafi, Maliki, and Shaf'i. They follow the path or sunnah
of Muhammad as described in the 'six authentic' books of hadith (traditions), and
from this they derive their title, to which assumption the rest of Islam, although
itself having traditions, has acquiesced. The Shi'ites, or 'followers' of 'Ali, the
fourth caliph and son-in-law of Muhammad, reject the first three caliphs, Abu
Bakr, 'Umar, and 'Uthman, and regard them as usurpers who prevented 'Ah
INVJ1±1S 393
from succeeding direcdy to die Prophet. The caliphate, or imamate, which latter
title they prefer to use, they hold to be hereditary in the house of 'Ah, and while
the rest of Islam gave allegiance to the first four caliphs in Mecca, and then
successively to the 'Umayyad caliphs of Damascus and the 'Abbaside caliphs of
Baghdad, they themselves dissembled, and sometimes even proclaimed, their sole
devotion to the descendants of 'Ah. Yet even as to these, the inveterate schismatics
disputed. The majority, the Twelvers, deem the succession to have ended at die
twelfth Imam, who, disappearing without issue into a cave about the year 878,
still guides his people through his theologians and, in a state of temporary occultation,
awaits the time when he shall return as the Mahdi, or 'The Righdy-Guided
One', to restore the true Islam, to conquer the world, and then to fill it with
righteousness before the end of all things. This to-day is the religion of the masses
of 'Iraq and the State religion of Persia, where the Shah is but the surrogate of
this hidden imam. It is a doctrine which has lent itself to much imposture, and
the Mahdi of the Sudan, Muhammad Ahmad, die destroyer of Gordon, disdaining
die occupation of boatbuilding, at which his family had achieved some merit,
preferred to be one of the many pretenders to this tide, and thereby brought much
tribulation to his countrymen. The doctrine is the more dangerous because the
divinely appointed Shi'ite imam, unlike the elected Sunni caliph, not only inherits
the temporal sovereignty of Muhammad, but is impeccable and infallible beyond
even, it may be, the pontiff of Rome. It is notable that King Abdulla of Jordan,
himself the senior living member of the House of'Ah, rejects this theory of their
great prerogative, and, a sincere Sunni, subscribes to the elective principle for
the caliphate.
Another group is the Severners, which regard Isma'il as the seventh Imam,
rather than his brother Musa. These Severners, or Isma'ilis, include the Carmathians
(see p. 85), the Nusayris (p. 291), the Fatimids, the Druzes, and the
Assassins, all dangerous fanatics. The Assassins, happily, are led to-day by the
Agha Khan, who, claiming descent from this seventh Imam, receives a tenth of
the revenue of his followers, and, like his grandfather, the friend and helper of
Napier, has, by the counsel and precept he has given to his often turbulent adherents
in India and elsewhere, given signal service to the cause of peace and order. Their
'prophet', Sinan (p. 264), was the infamous Old Man of the Mountain.
Shi'ism has many other sects, and for this has earned our Sunni traveller's
strictures (p. 291).
44. Ihram, lit. 'prohibition', denotes the doffing of laical dress and the assuming
of the pilgrim garb, the rida and the izar (see Glossary, p. 396), and the abstention
from certain actions until, St the proper time, this garb is laid aside. In this state,
the pilgrim is prohibited, inter alia, from deviating from absolute chastity, from
covering the head, wearing anything sewn or having seams, cutting the beard,
hair, or nails, anointing the head, plucking a blade of grass or cutting a green tree,
and from hunting or slaying animals save the five 'noxious creatures' - a biting
394 THE TRAVELS Of IBN JUBAYR
dog, a kite, a crow, a rat, and a snake or scorpion. For any transgressions of the
rules of ihram, special expiatory sacrifices are ordained, and it is said that none
but the Prophet could be perfect in the intricacies of the matter.
45. The 'Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) consists of a visit to the sacred mosque at
Mecca, with the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'bah and the ritual running
between al-Marwah and al-Safa, at any time of the year except during the
eighth, ninth, and tenth days of the month of Dhu '1-Hijjah, those being the
days of the Hajj or Greater Pilgrimage. It is a meritorious act to perform the
'Umrah, but the sacrifices, etc., are omitted and it has not the merit of the Hajj.
46. The Talbiyat or "Waiting for Orders' is the cry which the pilgrim, on
assuming the pilgrim garb, must constantly cry out as he approaches Mecca.
In full it is:
'Here am I, oh God, here am I. (Labbayka, Labbayka.)
No partner hast Thou, here am I.
Verily praise and grace are Thine, and dominion.
No partner hast Thou, here am I.'
47. This is part of the ancient practice of associating the church visible with
a bride. Doubtless it was this that led to the covering and veiling of the Ka'bah and
its early guardianship by eunuchs.
48. The tawaffc the rite of the sevenfold circumambulation, three times at a
quick pace and four at normal speed, of the Ka'bah. It is an ancient and pagan
practice, preserved by Muhammad to conciliate his idolatrous opponents.
49. This building, the Maqam, which Ibn Jubayr later describes, once housed
the sacred standing stone of Abraham on which he stood when, with the help
of his son Ishmael, he built the Ka'bah. For both the building and the stone
itself, which in the time of Ibn Jubayr was lodged inside the Ka'bah, the author
uses the term maqam indiscriminately. When the building is intended, I have
employed a capital M.
50. In the index to the Sunna, Kitab al-Kawkab al-Durri, MS., Leiden, 607, the
tradition is given as follows: 'The water of (the well of) Zamzam is for the end
for which it is drunk. If you drink it for a cure, it will cure you; if to fill your
stomach, it will satisfy it; and if to ease a burning thirst, it will quench it. This
well is the hollow (made by the feet) of Gabriel, and with its waters God quenched
the thirst of Ishmael.'
51. The ceremony of al-Sa'i consists in running seven times between the hills
of al-Safa and al-Marwah in commemoration of Hagar, who, seeing her son
Ishmael dying of thirst, ran seven times in great perturbation along the torrent
bed until the Angel Gabriel brought forth water from the well of Zamzam.
52. Halal, lit. 'that which is loosed or untied', or, in other words, that which
is lawful as distinguished from haram or that which is unlawful. In this case it
means release from the state of ihram described at note 42.
53. When the Ka'bah was rebuilt for the eighth time by the Quraysh, they
were compelled, through lack of funds, to curtail the plan followed since the
time of Abraham and to reduce its proportions by nearly seven cubits in the
direction of al-Hatim.
54. Burton, Pilgrimage to al-Madinah and Meccah, vol. II, p. 310, note 2, explains
that the tradition, as told to him, is that a Jew, having refused to sell his house
which was on that spot, was allowed to keep it in loco as a lasting testimony to
the Prophet's regard for justice.
55. The Carmathians were an Isma'ilite sect of the Shi'ite Muslims whose
eponymous founder was Hamdan Qarmat. Towards the close of the ninth century
they became a public force, and dominated the peninsula for a hundred
years. In A.D. 930 they horrified the Muslim world by capturing Mecca and
carrying off the sacred black stone to Bahrayn. It was restored in 951 by order of
the Fatimate Caliph al-Mansur.
56. Two words in the text are uncertain, being without diacritical points.
I have accepted De Goeje's suggestion, yaftakha yadaihi bihi.
57. The comparison is irreverent, it would seem, because the author is alluding
to pigeon-towers (abraj hamam).
58. The Zaydis are the Yemen Shi'ites, who to-day number a million. Of all
the Shi'ites they are the most akin to the orthodox Sunnis and the least fanatical.
They are the followers of Zayd, the grandson of al-Husayn son of'Ah the fourth
caliph and son-in-law of Muhammad. The Rafidites are so styled because they
are 'rejectors' of the three caliphs who preceded their hero 'Ah. The adjective
sabbahm I have translated as 'blaspheming', but Mr. 'Ah Sami '1-Nashar of
Alexandria University suggests that perhaps the text should have been edited as
saba'iyun, meaning the followers of 'Abdullah ibn Saba', a Jewish convert to
Islam who first expounded the concept of the divinity of 'Ah.
59. In Muslim countries a small oratory with a niche (mihrab) to indicate the
direction of Mecca is often found near a spring or well, or at one of the receptacles
that are daily filled widi water for die use of travellers (note by Schiaparelli).
60. Instead of Jiyad, Ibn Batuta, vol. I, pp. 321, 323, Ibn Rosteh, Bibl. Geog.
Arab, vol. VII, p. 44, and al-Fakihi, Chron. Stadt Mecca, vol. I, p. 479, vol. II,
p. 14, have Ajyad. Al-Muqaddasi gives the reading of Ibnjubayr. Ajyad al-Akbar
and Ajyad al-Asghar (Ajyad the Greater and Ajyad the Lesser) are two mountain
passes near Mount Abu Qubays (Ibn Batuta, vol. I, p. 303) and Mount al-
Khandamah behind it [ibid., p. 336). ^~
61. Ibn Batuta, vol. I, p. 323, calls this Bab al-Sidrah (The Lotus Tree Gate).
62. These words must be spurious.
63. A kinsman persecutor of the Prophet, and his wife who strewed diorn
bushes in the sand where Muhammad would walk barefooted. In flames they
expiate their want of grace, or perhaps of tact (Koran CXI).
396 iHii TRAVELS Or liJJN JUHAYR
64. Accepting the variation of al-Balawi, which the editor of the text prefers.
The text itself says, 'all traces of which have to-day been destroyed'.
65. So called, according to the tradition of Muhammad, because of the two
wings Ja'far received instead of the arms he lost at the Battle of Mutah.
66. Regarding the sighting of the new moon and its official recognition, see
al-Battani, edit. Nallino, vol. I, pp. 265-6, and the addition at p. lxxv.
67. Here a posture in the daily prayers in which the head and waist are inclined
and the palms of the hands rest upon the knees. Usually a section of the daily
prayers.
68. The Shaf and watar prayers are those with respectively an even and an odd
number of rak'ahs of prayers, and that are said after the last night prayers and
before the dawn prayers. Prayers with an odd number of rak'ahs, three, five, or
seven, are especially meritorious, and indeed odd numbers are generally favoured
by Muslims, and by many it would be considered unlucky to begin a work or
embark upon a journey on a date of even number.
69. The one prescribed by law for the communal prayers.
70. The 'Chapter of Power', Koran XCVHI, which relates how 'on the night
of Power' Muhammad received his first revelations. The word al-Qadr can also
mean 'divine decree'. The night thus received its name either from its excellence
above all other nights, or because of the divine determinations sent down that
night in the form of the Koran. Some Muslims believe that the divine decrees
or predeterminations for the forthcoming year are annually fixed on this night.
Muslim doctors are not unanimous as to what night exactly it falls, but it is one
of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan.
71. See Concordance et Indices de la Tradition Musalmane, A. J. Wensinck, Tome I,
p. 406, for reference to the book and chapter, together with the author, of those
collections of traditions of Muhammad where this quotation occurs.
72. Tashriq, lit. 'drying flesh in the sun'. It is the name given to the three days
that follow the Sacrifice, and during them the flesh of the victims is dried.
73. These cairns mark the places where the devil, in the guise of an old man,
came before Adam, Abraham, and Ishmael, and was repelled by stoning. To this
mode of attack they were prompted by the resource of the Archangel Gabriel.
74. The Arabs believed that each new moon's crescent took thirty nights to
form before it appeared to sight.
75. Tarwiyah, or 'giving attention', refers to Abraham's giving attention to the
vision in which he was on this day commanded to sacrifice Ishmael his son.
Alternatively, it may have the connotation 'carrying water', referring to the
provisions made by the pilgrims on this day.
76. This Qarun is the Korah of the Bible who led the rebellion against Moses
(Num. xvi and Jude 11). Mention of him and of his riches is made in three chapters
JNUlilb ^j
of the Koran: XXVIII, 76-82, XXIX, 39, and XL, 24-5. In the Talmud it is
said that three hundred white mules were needed to carry the keys of his treasure
(note from Schiaparelli).
77. 'Lawful magic' is the technical expression in Arabic rhetoric for the art of
oratoiy, as opposed to 'unlawful magic', which comprehends the arts of divination,
sorcery, and the like.
78. The Psalms of David, with the Torah (Pentateuch) and the Evangel (not
quite the Gospel of the New Testament), are, with the Koran, the books that
are deemed by Muslims to be divinely inspired.
79. The editor of the text says: 'This date is erroneous; it is clear from those
that precede and follow that Ibn Jubayr left Mecca on Tuesday the 20th of Dhu
'1-Hij;ah, or the 3rd of April.
80. Isbahan (Isfahan) is more correctly in 'Iraq 'Ajami, which, with Khurasan,
formed part of the great Empire of Khwarizm ruled by the Seljuk Turk princes
of Khiva. 'Imad al-Din ('Ala al-Din) Tukush Shah ruled from A.D. 1172-99.
Schiaparelli points our (note 74) that the use of the definite article al before
Daqus indicates that Ibn Jubayr considered it to be an epidiet meaning 'The Brave'
rather than a Turkish surname.
81. The word 'Bdellium' (Gr. |36EAAIOV) is used by Pliny as the name of a
plant exuding a fragrant gum. It is similar to true myrrh. (See Gen. ii. 12 and
Num xi. 7.)
82. Doughty, Arabia Deserta, vol. I, p. 19, thus describes this sudden departure
on the signal that is 'eloquent in the desert night, the great caravan rising at the
instant, with sudden untimely hubbub of the pilgrim thousands; there is a short
struggle of making ready, a calling and running with lanterns, confused roaring
and ruckling of camels, and the tents are taken up over our heads. In this haste
aught: left behind will be lost, all is but a short moment, and the pilgrim army is
remounted.'
83. Rawdah (garden) after the saying of Muhammad's: 'Between my tomb and
my pulpit is a garden of the gardens of Paradise.' By synecdoctic extension, the
author sometimes uses it to refer to the whole south portico, in which the rawdah
proper is situated. This is the adytum or inner sanctuary of the Mosque at Medina.
The term is also used to indicate the tomb itself.
84. Sir Richard Burton, in Pilgrimage to al-Madinak, vol. I, p. 305, states that
in order to distinguish the superior merit of the Ka'bah in Mecca, 'men should
not kiss the tomb as at the Ka'bah'.
85. Al-Sharishi, vol. II, p. 142, gives this measurement as forty-four spans,
which perhaps is the correct one. The editor of the text wrongly offers this
alternative to the thirty spans of the east side.
86. Burton is sadly astray in a translation of this passage (ibid,, vol. I, p. 323),
even quoting this chest, which is only five spans long, as being the prophet's coffin.
398 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
87. Baki' al-Gharqad, lit. 'the place full of the roots of the buckthorn'. Burton,
Pilgrimage, etc., vol. I, p. 405, describes this tree, and declares it to be the Rhamnus
Nabeca or Zizyphus Spina Christi that is supposed to have crowned the Saviour's
head. It is a form of lotus, but Burton says that disappointed 'lotus-eaters' have
successively compared it with a bad plum, an unripe cherry, and an insipid apple.
Burton refers to Forskal's Descriptiones animalium, avium, . . . et flora Aegyptiaco-
Arabica, but gives no reference, and since an exhaustive search made therein for
me by the late Librarian of the Cambridge University Library, Mr. A. Scholfield,
Fellow of King's College, revealed no trace of the plant, I must conclude that
Burton did not check his reference.
88. The two lights referred to are his two wives, Ruqayah and Umm Kulthum,
daughters of the Prophet.
89. The Fugitives (Muhajirun) were those converts to Islam who fled with the
Prophet from the persecution of Mecca to the protection of Medina. The Helpers
(Ansar) were the early converts in Medina.
90. In the sixth year of his caliphate, according to Abulfeda and Yaqut, 'Uthman
inadvertently dropped into this well the prophetic ring, which had come to him
through the first two caliphs, he being the third. It had been used as a seal for
letters to neighbouring kings. This well therefore also bears the name Bir al-
Khatim (The Well of the Seal-ring), for the ring was never found, despite a
thorough search. It obtained its name ' Aris from a Jew in Madina, and it is also
called Bir al-Taflat (The Well of Saliva), from the Prophet's having spat in it.
The sweetening effect of this operation was no longer apparent in 1853 when
Sir Richard Burton found it to have 'a pronounced medicinal taste' (ibid., vol. I,
p. 413).
91. The Confederates were some leaders of the Jewish tribe of the Banu '1-
Nadir who had been driven out from Madina by Muhammad, and the Quraysh
and other tribes of Mecca who had rejected the Prophet. By means of this
ditch, the forces of Muhammad were able to hold Mecca from them (Koran
XXXIII).
92. According to Ibn Batuta, vol. I, p. 265, the name of this spring is 'Ain
al-Zarqa'.
93. I have accepted Schiaparelli's alternative of'began' from al-Sharishi, vol. II,
p. 141. The text has abtaiaru, 'they made haste to'.
94. So great were the conveniences, together with endowments to maintain
them, provided on this desert pilgrim route by the piety of Zubayda that it was
called Darb Zubayda (Zubayda's Way) and has been trodden by pilgrim feet for
above a thousand years. The crossing, from Madina to al-Kufa, is about six
hundred miles, and since our traveller's caravan took twenty days, they covered
an average of thirty miles a day: eloquent testimony of the efficiency of the
march discipline of the modey host and of the faculties of die road.
NOTES 399
95. Sale's translation offar al-tannur is 'the oven poured forth water', Palmer's
'the oven boiled', and Rodwell's 'the earth's surface boiled up'. But tannur can
mean 'reservoir' or 'a place where waters collect', and_^r, in reference to water,
means 'welled from the earth'. These are the significances which surely attach
to the words when talking of the Deluge.
96. The Enoch who, in Gen. iv. 17 and 18, is given as the eldest son of Cain,
and in Gen. v. 21-4 as the sixth in descent from Cain's brother Seth. The juxtaposition
of his name with that of Noah reminds us that die apocryphal Book
of Enoch is the conglomerate of literary fragments that once circulated under
the names of Noah, Enoch, and possibly Enoch's half-as-long living son
Methuselah.
97. The abstemious Arabs are great connoisseurs of water, and one of their
tests is to weigh it. Lightness is a sign of wholesomeness and digestibility.
98. The 'Abbaside Caliphs were descended from al-'Abbas, the paternal uncle
of the Prophet. This dynasty, like the present ruling houses of Jordan and 'Iraq,
was Hashemite and Qurayshite. That is, it derived from Hashim, great-grandfather
of the Prophet Muhammad, of the tribe of Quraysh. The full tide of the ruler
of Jordan is 'His Hashemite Majesty King Abdullah I'.
99. See Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, vol. II, p. 316, note 30. The significance of
die proverb here is that all you desire is under the skin of this brilliant faqih.
The proverb was one of the reasons for the arrest and execution of the assassin
of Sir Lee Stack, the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, in 1924, for he had been
heard to mutter it before the commission of the crime. In that case, of course,
the murderer used it in its hunting sense.
100. See Freytag, ibid., vol. I, p. 370, note 88. The original words referred to
Ma'an ibn Sajidah ibn 'Abdullah Shaybanita, whose 'liberalitate' had passed into
proverb.
101. The expression 'Where is the readiness . . . etc' refers to words spoken
by 'Ali, the fourth caliph, to his lukewarm followers after the taking of al-Anbar
in nordiern 'Iraq by his rival, Mu'awiyah. Malik ibn al-Ashtar was 'Ali's fighting
general.
102. Preferring the mashurah (noted) of al-Sharishi to the musawwarah (walled)
of the text. It is unlikely that this quarter of the city would be walled.
103. Tabby. The thick watered silk or moreen of this name is so called from
the quarter in Baghdad where it was made.
104. SchiapareUi omits the name of Mu'in, instead of which he reads tnin (of).
He supports this by quoting Ibn Batuta, vol. II, p. 108, and recalls that neither
in Ibn Sa'd, III, I, 11-12, nor in Tabari, I, 3,470 seq., is there any mention of
Mu'in among the sons of 'AH.
105. This cemetery is now called al-Kazimayn.
400 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
106. This misra' (hemistich) occurs among some verses attributed by Ibn
Bassam to the poet Ibn Khafajah, and published by Dozy in his R&herches, p. 340.
Note by die textual editor.
107. Samarra is the town on the Tigris to which the Caliph al-Mu'tasim, fearful
of a rising in Baghdad against his oppressive Turkish guards, removed his seat
of government in A.D. 836. It was a fatal move, for it placed the caliphs at the
mercy of their praetorians. Ibn Jubayr indulges a grim conceit in a play on
its name.
108. The word qaysariyah, deriving from the Greek KCCia&pEtoc, denotes here a
large square building containing store-rooms and shops for merchants. The name
was confined to those Arab countries that were subject to the Byzantines, e.g.
Egypt, Syria, and Morocco, and was not employed in 'Iraq. It would seem to
indicate a market building that was specially licensed by the Caesar in return
for a settled fee.
109. St. George is a noted martyr in the Orient, even among Muslims, who
include him among their prophets, and confound him with Elijah. Tabari, vol. I,
PP- 795-812, has a note on him.
no. Of the men of this trade, Doughty, in Arabia Deserta, vol. I, p. 3, says:
'The camel-masters are sturdy, weathered men of the road, that can hold mastery
over their often mutinous crews; it is written in their hard faces that they are
overcomers of the evil by the evil, and able to deal in the long desert way with
the perfidy of the elvish Beduins.'

112. Proverbial among the Arabs for his taking after his father. See Freytag,
Arabum Proverbia, vol. I, p. 658.
113. The Hamdanids were a nomadic dynasty in northern Syria whose capital
was Aleppo. The founder, Sayf al-Dawlah (The Sword of the State), was a scourge
in the side of the Byzantines, but also a munificent patron of learning. Himself
a poet, his court was filled with poets, philosophers, and musicians. To the historian
Abu '1 Faraj of Isfahan, who produced one of the most celebrated works
of Arabic literature, the Kitab al-Aghani (The Book of Songs), he gave one
thousand pieces of gold, with his regrets that he could only so inadequately
reward him. His martial exploits, together with his promotion of the arts of
peace, reviving for a space the dying flame of Arab nationalism, has made him
ever dear to Arab minds.
114. The Orontes was called by the Greeks A£iOS TTOTOHOS from the old Syrian
name, Atzoio, meaning 'The Rapid', and this the Arabs corrupted to al-'Asi,
'The Rebel', because, unlike the other rivers of the country, it flowed from
south to north. Its one hundred and seventy miles' course is mainly unnavigable
and is litde used for irrigation, but its valley was a high-road for armies and trade
between Egypt and Palestine and Asia Minor.
NOTES 401
115. This is the Great or 'Umayyad Mosque that, until the Muslim conquest
of Damascus in A.D. 635, had been the Cathedral Church of St. John the Baptist.
For eighty years it sheltered under one roof the practice of the Christian and
the Muslim faiths, until the tolerance of the Caliph 'Umar was exchanged for
the bigotry of Walid. The building begun by the Emperor Theodosius I in
A.D. 375 was largely destroyed, and re-erected as a mosque. Retaining much of
the materials and form of the church, it is not of the usual pattern of mosque,
and has the nave and aisle design of the Christian basilica, with, of course, the
added mihrah, colonnades, etc. The Byzantine decorative manner is also evident.
116. The Muslims in their conquests distinguished between territory taken by
assault and that acquired as a result of capitulation. The former became an integral
part of the Muslim Empire; the latter remained in the possession of the vanquished,
who paid tribute. This privilege was offered only to Christians and Jews, who
are not idolators, but Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Scriptures). Hitti, History of the
Arabs, p. 150, quotes the terms of capitulation for Damascus:
'In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. This is what Khalid
ibn Walid would grant to the inhabitants of Damascus if he should enter therein:
he promises to give them security for their lives, their property, and their churches.
Their city wall shall not be demolished, neither shall any Muslim be quartered in
their houses. Thereunto we give to them the pact of Allah and the protection of
His Prophet, the Caliphs, and the Believers. So long as they pay the poll-tax,
nothing but good shall befall them.' The poll-tax was one dinar and one jarib
or measure of wheat on every head; women and children, the aged and the
destitute, as well as monks and those sorely distressed, were exempt.
117. Guy Le Strange, in Palestine Under the Muslims, p. 246, corrects this
to 'east'.
118. Ibn Batuta, vol. I, p. 201, has twenty-five thousand gold dinars.
119. Kallasah meaning 'lime-kiln', and referring here to the kiln north of the
mosque which provided lime for its building. Saladin, who rebuilt it after a fire
that burnt it down, is buried in a mausoleum that still exists in the north of the
building.
120. When, in the time of the thrid Caliph, 'Uthman, disputes arose as to
the true form of the revelations made to Muhammad, the Caliph appointed a
committee to prepare a definitive version. Copies of it were then sent to all the
chief cities, and this recension of'Uthman has remained to this day the standard text.
121. The sense of this passage required die substitution of'mountain* for 'cave'
which is in the text.
122. The words 'and night' have been introduced from Ibn Batuta, vol. I, p. 232.
123. The text gives only masu ..., and Dozy conjectures massufiyin, from Massuf,
a North African town. King Abdulla of Jordan suggested to me that masuwamin,
'specially garbed', might be intended.

124. The 'Choice Ones' were those poor Companions of the Prophet who
lived without labour in the mosque at Madina. They are believed to be the
early mystics of Islam.
125. This Sunni sect, al-Nubuwiyah, revered a quality of the Prophet
Muhammad, futuwah, or 'manliness', which gave its name to another and wider
organisation. Starting in the twelfth century as a Darwish order, the Futuwah
bestowed on its members the patched robe of a Sufi mystic which they called
Hbas al-Jutuwah, or 'the trousers of manliness'. They defined futuwah as 'abstaining
from injury, giving unreservedly, and being without complaint'. Having
been invested with the trousers of a Sufi, the Caliph Nasir, probably as part of
his plan to restore the power of the caliphate, reorganised the order on the model
of the Christian knighdy orders. Its members, fityan, were initiated in a special
ceremony, took an oath, and assumed the distinctive garments. The Futuwah
had a particular attachment to 'Ali, and many of the brodierhood were descendants
of the son-in-law of die Prophet. They availed the Caliph nodiing in his design,
and although the order survived him, it languished and disappeared without
achievement. The Nubuwiyah sect which Ibn Jubayr found in Syria had adopted
the same motto and dress, but it is interesting that, despite the excessive devotion
of the Futuwah to 'Ah, the Nubuwiyah were the scourge of the fanatical Shi'ite
sects of Syria, who almost made a god of him.
126. 'Ball on horseback' was the sole distraction allowed himself by Nurredin,
Saladin's great predecessor. 'Yet,' he declared, 'I do not play to amuse myself,
but rather for needful recreation, since a soldier cannot always be in
batde. And at this game we are a-horse and ready for sudden attack by die
enemy.'
127. This sentence is misplaced, and should have come in the description of
the Bayt Lahiyah (The House of Idols) on p. 288.
128. The ritl is a measure of weight that in those days averaged six hundred
dirhams (a dirham being 47J grains Troy) and was equivalent to six pounds.
By inversion of the T and the Y, it is the Greek Arrpoc, or litre. It is, however,
not only a standard of weight, but also a measure of capacity, for, like the Romans,
the Arabs calculated cubic measure by the weight of a specific quantity of oil
or wine. See Guy Le Strange's Palestine Under the Muslims, pp. 48-51, for a careful
description of mediaeval Syrian weights and measures.
129. The name of this Samosatian was Abu '1-Qassim 'Ah ibn Muhammad.

die sums are utterly disproportionate to each other.

132. Salibiyah, 'cross-like', means that the sails were set cross-ways to the mast,
or, in other words, were square-rigged. The expression is used again on p. 332,
where the comment is made that this is the favourite rig among the Rum, since
it caught the wind coming aft of the ship.
133. This unsuccessful expedition against Kerak, and the burning of Nablus
on his way back, was Saladin's last engagement in Palestine for some years. His
next campaign led, in A.D. 1187, to the capture of Jerusalem.
134. Agnes of Courtenay, mother of Baldwin IV.
135. The Assizes of Jerusalem, a collection of usages compiled by John of
Ibelin, a Cypriot lawyer, specify one hundred and eleven articles on which duty
was paid at Acre.
136. A qirat was the twenty-fourth part of anything, in this case of a dinar.
It is an. Arab corruption of the Greek word Kepornov, the fruit of the keratea,
carob, or lotus tree, also known as St. John's bread. From it derives our word
'carat'. Many names of Arab weights and measures came from the Greek and
Latin, being those in use in the Syrian provinces of the Byzantine Empire at the
time of the Muslim invasion. Mukaddasi, writing at the close of the tenth century
A.D., says that the qirat is equivalent to three and a half barleycorns. A barleycorn,
or habb, weighs about seven-tenths of a grain, English.
137. The manorial system in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem maintained the
village system of the Arabs. Tenants paid from a quarter to a half of the crop,
with the addition of poll-tax and labour dues. As is to be expected, the bulk of
the village inhabitants were native Syrians, and it is interesting to observe that
our author finds that they deem themselves to be in better case under their Frankish
lords than their brother Muslims under Muslim lords.
138. Acre was taken by the crusaders on the 24th of March, A.D. 1104, which
was the 24th of Jumada al-Akhirah, A.H. 497, which, of course, is in the last
decade of the fifth century A.H. (note by Schiaparelli).
139. 'Adam was sent a red bull, which he used to plough the ground; and he
dried the sweat on his brow.' Tabari, vol. I, p. 129; al-Kashaf (Cairo, 1281),
vol. n, p. 33; Ibn Athir, vol. I, p. 29; cf. Koran XX, 115, and Gen. iii. 17-19
(note by Schiaparelli).
140. In Syria the Franks adopted from the Arabs the tabor (Ar., tunbur, a lute
or drum) and the naker (Ar., naqqarah, a kettledrum) for their military bands,
which hitherto had been served only by trumpets and horns. See P. K. Hitti,
History of the Arabs, p. 664.
141. Ibn Jubayr refers to King Baldwin IV, who had been a leper since childhood.
The King of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem would also be Lord of Acre.
At the time of Ibn Jubayr's visit, Baldwin's sickness was so advanced that he had
already, in 1183, caused his little nephew, the son of his sister Sybilla, to be
404 I His IKAViiLa Ur IxJJN JUxJAYK.
anointed King, although Baldwin IV continued active for a time. In 1184 he
handed over the regency to Count Raymond of Tripoli, and died in 1185.
142. Count Raymond of Tripoli continued to be regent for the infant
Baldwin V. The King's maternal uncle was Joscelin of Courtenay, Seneschal
of me Kingdom and notoriously interested in its finances. The prudence of
Raymond secured a truce with Saladin soon after Ibn Jubayr left the country,
but it was broken by the perfidy and rashness of Raymond de Chatillon, and
in 1187 Jerusalem was lost to the Christians. The county of Tiberias had come to
Raymond through his wife.
143. Ibn Jubayr should have said 'south-east', but the westward trend of the
coast as the voyager sails south might have deceived him.
144. Although the artimone mast means rnizzen or after-mast, it was not always
so, and, according to M. Jal's Glossaire Nautique, art. 2, 'Artimon', it meant, in
the thirteenth century, the foremast of a three-masted ship.
145. Jal, ibid., states that the dolon sail was smaller than the artimone, and was
square-rigged, whereas the artimone was fore-and-aft.
146. Verses of Ibn Rashiq al-Qayrawani. See Diwan ibn Hamdis, ed. Schiaparelli,
p. 476; Tiraz al-Mughalis, Cairo, 1284, p. 220; al-Maqqari, vol. I, p. 23 seq.
147. Sul is the pass in Derbend in the Caucasus whose nights were proverbial
for their length. As the editor of the text indicates, the expression derives from
a poem by Hunduj ibn Hunduj al-Murri, Lisan, XIH, 412.
148. The 'bursting of the dam' of Ma'rib, brought about by a flood, is a memorable
event in Arab history and much quoted in Islamic literature. It occurred in
the middle of the sixth century, but the ruins of the dam are visible to this day.
The event was a great catastrophe to the Arabs, and is referred to in the Koran
(XXXIV, 16).
149. To explain the fact of two rudders being mentioned, the editor of the text
quotes Jal, Glossaire Nautique, where, in the article on 'Timo', he cites several
passages from documents of the years 1246 and 1268 showing that ships had two
rudders, one on each side.
150. Lit. 'The male-camels were deprived of their sexual powers', meaning,
metaphorically, that the men were robbed of their strength. The editor of the
text refers to Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, vol. II, p. 251, which translates the passage
as 'the wild ass was stopped in its onslaught', but this is clearly inappropriate.
151. Like the editor of the text, I am unable to find the origin of this proverb.
152. See Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, vol. I, p. 537, note 41. The significance is
that if, after wide travels, a man returns home without booty, he yet may be
content with being unhurt.
153. Although Norman French was the language of war, society, and the chase,
the languages of inscriptions and documents were Greek, Arabic, and Latin.
NOTES 405
154. 'Alamah, or 'sign', was the technical term for a kind of motto with which
Muslim princes headed their rescripts after the formula Bismillah, 'In the name of
God', etc. This is a further indication of the degree to which the Norman kings
of Sicily adopted Muslim practice. The 'alamah of King William I, indeed, was
only syntactically different from that of the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, Dhahir
(1020-35). See Novairi, Manuscript arabe de le Bibliothtque royal, ancien finds,
n° 702, A, fol. 56, r° (note from Amari).
155. Silk and gold embroidering was introduced into Sicily by its Arab conquerors,
and when the Normans arrived in the island in the year 1060, the industry
went on much as before, though with greater magnificence. The famous imperial
mantle at Vienna, perhaps the most sumptuous of mediaeval embroideries, bears
round its edge an Arabic inscription recording that it was made at Palermo in
Sicily in the year 1134. Beset with pearls and gems, and worked with gold thread
on red silk, it displays a lion leaping on a camel. This design probably represents
the capture of the island by the Normans from the Arabs. A fragment of the
brocade in pink silk, with a pattern of gazelles, birds, and trees, in gold, in which
the Emperor Henry VI (d. 1197) was buried in Palermo, can still be seen in the
British Museum. According to the usage of those days, the industry was practised
within the precincts of the royal palace, and the intendant of the manufactory
was one of the most important servants at the court. (Sacy, Chrest. ar., vol. II,
pp. 287 and 305). In addition to providing splendid vestments for the sovereign
and other personages, it served as a respectable screen for a seraglio.
156. Conversion to Islam was, of course, forbidden in this Christian kingdom.
On the other hand, conversion to Christianity was not encouraged, and indeed
the Arab troops which composed so large a part of the Sicilian infantry were
deemed to be more trustworthy when unconverted.
157. This earthquake took place in 1163, destroying Catane and other towns
in Sicily, while the sea invaded part of Messina. King William was then only
seventeen years of age.
158. As is commonly known, there is barely any tide in the Mediterranean,
but Amari (p. 72) suggests that in this case the rise and fall was caused by the
winds of the north, north-east, and north-west.
159. Amari, p. 76, says that Ibn Jubayr no doubt refers to the leper hospital
which William II made in the Church of St.-Jean, founded by Robert Guiscard
on the road to Qasr Ja'far.
160. 'Watch-towers and belvederes.' Such synonyms are employed, here and
elsewhere, to make rhymed prose, which is the reason for the otherwise unnecessary
repetition.
161. At Palermo the terms of the capitulation secured to the Muslims the full
enjoyment of their own laws.
AI
406 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
162. For the greater part of this century, the trade of the island was largely
controlled by the Muslim merchants.
163. The khutbah should be delivered not only on Fridays, but on the two
great festivals of 'Id al-Fitr and Id al-Adha. Since it includes intercessions, by
name, for the Caliph and the reigning sovereign (who should be a Muslim), the
prudence of the Norman King could scarcely allow the weekly assembly of
thousands of Muslims to profess a faith at once religious and political. But the
wisdom of William or his government is attested by the solution of permitting
the observance of the khutbah, as Ibn Jubayr relates, on the two great feast days.
The religious fervour of the Muslims at the time of these festivals would not be
embittered by the denial of a sacred duty, and the precautionary police and
administrative arrangements that must always attend so large and potentially
dangerous an assembly would not be too inconvenient if limited to two occasions
in the year. At the same time, the Norman King could smile with indulgence at
the intercessions for the 'Abbassid caliphs, who at that time had declined to the
position of pawns or even prisoners of the Seljuk sultans.
164. The Church of the Antiochian was named after its Greek founder, the
celebrated George of Antioch, Admiral of the Sicilian fleet, who had warred
against the Eastern Empire and carried off the silk-workers of Thebes and Peloponnesus
to Sicily. He had formerly been an officer in the service of a Muslim
prince in al-Mahdiyah, Africa. See Hitti, History of the Arabs, p. 609. This church
is now called La Martorana, after the name of the founder of a convent attached
to the church. The belfry and mosaics remain. See Amari, p. 81.
165. Barr al-'Adwah, 'Land of Passage', means that part of the North African
coast which is opposite to Spain, and to which direct passage can be made from
that country. By extension, Ibn Jubayr includes Tunisia and the intervening
country.
166. The mountain was renamed St. Julian by the Normans in gratitude to the
saint, who had given valuable assistance in its capture by setting a pack of hounds
at the infidels. See Amari, p. 83. The well-known beauty of the women is attested
by our traveller's wish (for awareness of womanly charms is congruous with
Muslim piety) that they should one day fall prisoner to the Muslims.
167. An important occasion, since the sight of the new moon is the signal for
the end of the fast of the month of Ramadan, and the beginning of the joyful
'Id al-Fitr.
168. The traveller may dispense with a certain number of prostrations as well
as the attendance at the congregational prayers on Fridays.
169. The news was indeed true. Abu Ya'qub Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Mu'min, the
Almohade sovereign of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and part of Spain, had just
died, and his Almoravid rival, 'Ah ibn 'Isa, who held only Majorca, had by surprise
taken Bougie from the Almohades. Ibn Jubayr, as his chagrin shows, was
NOTES 407
an Almohade supporter. Consult Cond6, Hist, de la dom. des Arabes en Espana,
part HI, cap. 50.
170. Ibn Jubayr's allegiance to the Almohades did not cause him to wish success
to a Christian assault on the rival but nevertheless Muslim Almoravids of Majorca.
171. William II had concluded a treaty of peace with Abu Ya'qub (see note 169,
p. 386) in 1180. In consideration of die religious fanaticism of their subjects, which
on bodi sides dictated the extermination of the infidel, the treaty was for ten
years only, and styled a truce. "William's grandfather, Roger, had indeed conquered
territories in Tripoli and Tunis which had been lost by William I, but
William II, despite his powerful navy, was too much preoccupied widi his designs
against the Byzantine Empire, then led by the redoubtable Manuel Comnenos,
to embroil himself with die Almohade ruler. Neither would he be unmindful
of the large market in Tunis for the wheat of Sicily, and, equally or more
important, he could not forget that his army was half composed of Moors, and
that his Muslim subjects were numerous and inimical.
172. Muhammad had promised the Muslims that they should conquer Constantinople
(see, as noted by Amari, the collection of traditions of Muhammad
translated into English by Matthews under the title Mishcat ul musabih, lib. xxiii,
cap. II, vol. II, p. 550, Calcutta, 1809). Ibn Jubayr's confidence that the promise
would be fulfilled was confirmed after the passage of three centuries, when the
Turks seized the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire in A.D. 1453.
173. Ibn Jubayr seems to have shared the general misapprehension in the island
on this matter. The youth who had arrived in Sicily was not the son and heir
of Manuel, the deceased Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, but a grandnephew
named, like the heir, Alexis. The boy-heir had in fact succeeded, as Alexis II, in
1180 under the unpopular guardianship of his mother, the Empress Maria. But,
as Ibn Jubayr says, the throne was usurped by a cousin of Manuel, Andronicus
Comnenos, who, gaining the support of the Army, had marched on Constantinople.
Maria was strangled, and the youthful wearer of the purple soon followed
his mother, throttled by a bow-string, the callous tyrant observing with a kick:
'Thy father was a knave, thy mother a whore, and thyself art a fool.'
Before his usurpation, Andronicus, as Ibn Jubayr relates, had found asylum
with the Muslim Sultan of Iconium, whence he had made frequent incursions on
his cousin the Emperor Manuel's province of Trebizond, earning for these impious
acts against Christian lands the penalty of excommunication. But Andronicus
himself never renounced his faith, and it was his brother John who was converted
to Islam and received the hand of the Sultan's daughter. 'The sister famed for
her beauty' who, as Ibn Jubayr declares, had gone with Andronicus to the protection
of the Sultan, was in fact the niece of Manuel, Theodora, the widow of
Baldwin. Ill of Jerusalem. She became not the wife but the mistress of the future
Emperor, and in the luminous pages of Gibbon we may read that 'the queen of'
408 THE TRAVELS OF IBN JUBAYR
Jerasalem was exposed to the East his obsequious concubine; and two illegitimate
children were the living monuments of her weakness'. Of Andronicus himself
the master says: 'in every deed of mischief he had a heart to resolve, a head to
contrive, and a hand to execute'. During the civil war that followed the Emperor
Manuel's death and Andronicus's usurpation, the Sultan (it was Qilij Arslan II,
son of Mas'ud I, but sometimes addressed by his father's name, p. 240) profited
by the upset to seize some border villages, and it was this which was magnified
by Ibn Jubayr's informants into a Muslim conquest of Constantinople. Andronicus
was himself not long after overthrown, and, abandoned to the fury of his numerous
sufferers, endured for three days the most painful agonies that their resentment
could suggest. The sword of a pitying or a bitter Latin at last released him from
his purgatory.
174. No Muslims entered Constantinople, and it was not the Rum (Byzantine
Greeks) who were slaughtered. Rather, the Greeks themselves celebrated the
advent of Andronicus to Constantinople with a barbarous massacre of the Latin
citizens of the town. The text goes on to say that the 'Aghr n helped
Andronicus in his enterprise. The editor of the text has supplied 'Aghriqiyun (Ar.,
'Greeks') from Maqrizi, cod. Leid. 372, vol. Ill, near the end, but since the previous
sentence says that the Greeks were the victims, and the next goes on to say
that these Aghr n spoke Arabic and did not permit the eating of pork,
it does not seem that the author here intends Greeks, although, of course, it was
the Greeks who performed the main carnage. I was utterly baffled by this word
until Dr. Erwin I. J. Rosenthal of the University of Cambridge suggested that
the Qaraites might have been intended. He referred me to Benjamin of Tudeh's
Itinerary, tr. and ed. by A. Asher, London and Berlin, 1840, pp. is-25. Benjamin
visited Constantinople in the sixties of the twelfth century, and found it to be
the spiritual centre of a Jewish sect of that name. There were five hundred
Qaraites then in the city, and they were distinct from the two thousand Rabbinite
or orthodox Jews, from whom they hved separated by a wall. This division might
easily be improved by an outsider into 'a concealed enmity'; the Qaraites might
easily have spoken Arabic (or it might be 'Hebrew' was intended, for an error
in two letters could change 'Hebrew' into 'Arabic'); and the name Qara'iyun
(Ar., Qaraites) is not, in Arabic characters, unlike Aghriqiyun. On the other hand,
the Qaraites, from all reports, were peaceful souls who were characterised by
widespread literary activity (see Encycl. Judaica, vol. IX, pp. 943 f). But Ibn
Jubayr, speaking second-hand and at a remote distance of alien races and creeds,
so far departs from his customary exactitude throughout this whole matter that
we can but conjecture his meaning, if indeed he knew himself. He is, of course,
in this case not speaking from personal experience, but we are astonished that
his informants, who would have been the leading Muslims of Sicily, themselves
en rapport with the reliable Christian sources, should be so ignorant of great events
some two years after their occurrence.
175. This fleet was indeed despatched to Constantinople, in accordance with
William II's thesis that the best way of dealing with the schismatic Greeks was to
capture Constantinople, to remove the ruling house of Comnenos, and to place
the Greek Empire under Latin rule. His ancestors had driven them from southern
Italy, and their revenge he must constantly apprehend. The whole Latin world
joined him in this hatred, which, compounded with religious animosity, finally
led to the diversion of the Fourth Crusade (A.D. 1204) to the conquest of Constantinople.
William's fleet left Sicily on the n t h of June, n 85, with more than
two hundred sail, but the expedition, although gaining a naval victory and sending
a land force as far as Thessalonica, finally miscarried with the loss of many men.
176. The Qa'id Abu '1-Qassim ibn Hammud was no doubt a scion of the
illustrious family which had usurped, for a few years, the caliphate of Cordova.
Amari, p. 95, suggests that he might have been in correspondence with Qa'id
Pierre, late first chamberlain of William, who some years earlier had sought
refuge at the court of the Almohades.
